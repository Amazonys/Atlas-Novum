#japanese (having taken a look at the map again it might be better to complete the regions with descriptors seeing as without the descriptors, a bunch provinces bear the same names. Maybe a native speaker can give more time-appropriate and unique names later down the road)
#korea
#733 = "Kokai"
#2742 = "Kankyo"
#(These were already coverred)
