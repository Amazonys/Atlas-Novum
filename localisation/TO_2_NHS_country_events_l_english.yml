They are requesting our aid in building a large network of aqueducts in the Appalachian Mountains to bring water to our capital and the surrounding countryside. This water would be used for farming, public baths and our new sewage system, and as a result we could produce more and colonize faster. As for construction, four plans have been proposed to us by our architects: \n1. [936.GetName]-[949.GetName]-[2011.GetName]-[2550.GetName]-[953.GetName] \n2.

A favourite story told by the common people is that one day so called 'Marble Emperors' will return and deliver Palia Constantinople back into Elysian hands. The peasants and merchants of Neo Konstantinoupolis are calling for a great statue to be built in the forum that shows their triumphant return, made of marble of course."

There is a debate occurring among the people on the usefulness of repairing the fleet at all, as it will be expensive to repair and maintain. The alternative is that we break down the ships for wood, which we can then use to help build the local infrastructure such as roads and housing, or for building a basic wooden palisade around the settlement to help protect us from native incursions."

The obvious solution is to send more men to patrol those areas; however, the guard is spread thin as it is, and this would leave the city severely undermanned. The militia are rather basic right now, made up of retired soldiers and part time farmers, but with a little time and training they could become a significant force in their own right."

If we agree to limit Neo Konstantinoupolis' outward growth for now and therefore leave their towns intact, they are willing to provide our people with some men and resources.

Indeed, our alchemists and engineers have plans to improve the range and reliability of both ship mounted and handheld variants using more modern techniques and materials.

The natives speak of great pits of black liquid rising from cracks in the ground to the north-east of $CAPITAL_CITY$, near the Borealian Lakes.

None of our records going back to ancient times speak of such large deposits of Naphtha, which should last us for generations to come.

 nhs2_countryevents.44.d:0 "We have long been living near these naphtha wells without complaint, using it to waterproof our canoes and produce medicines. However, this large tribe of easterners from across the great sea have expressed much interest in purchasing it. We know not why they desire it so badly, but they are prepared to pay handsomely in precious metals and their advanced technology."
 nhs2_countryevents.44.a:0 "These easterners have a deal."

The native tribe in the area has accepted our generous trade deal, in which we give them gold, silver, and technology more advanced than the sharpened sticks they've been using for the last thousand years in return for the naphtha we need to manufacture Greek Fire."

 nhs2_countryevents.47.d:0 "Now that we have reformed our senate and administration, the question has come up of what to do with our Kretan brothers. Some members of the senate advocate annexing them directly to the empire, but others say that Crete has been an ever-stalwart ally and bulwark to the east, and that the Kretans should retain their home-rule."
 nhs2_countryevents.47.a:0 "Annex them directly into the empire. Welcome home, Mikra Krete!"
 nhs2_countryevents.47.b:0 "They are stalwart vassals. Let us continue the current state of affairs."
 
 nhs2_countryevents.48.t:0 "The Portuguese are livid!"
 nhs2_countryevents.48.d:0 "With our recent rediscovery of Europe, we can now see that our supposed demise has had a large impact on the culture of Europe, especially the Portuguese. Wary of travelling too far west, the Portuguese and to a lesser extent the Spanish established a number of small trading posts along the coast of West Africa, trading with the kingdoms there for gold and salt. As a result, the kingdoms of Europe are relatively poor, being largely cut out of the spice market by the Ottomans. However, our rediscovery has led to a renewed drive to explore both the new world and to find another route to the riches of India."
 nhs2_countryevents.48.a:0 "How were we supposed to know?"
 
 nhs2_countryevents.49.t:0 "European Trade Ventures"
 nhs2_countryevents.49.d:0 "Since the rediscovery of our old homeland, adventurous individuals from all over Europe have begun making the perilous journey to the new world, nominally to explore and no doubt strike it rich along the way. However despite their interest, many European explorers avoid Elysian territory, wary of a people they had long thought perished at sea. Sensing a unique opportunity, many Elysian ports are opening their doors, offering preferential treatment to European merchants. While we could allow this open trade policy to continue, the Elysian state and its predecessors have traditionally held tight control over foreign trade."
 nhs2_countryevents.49.a:0 "Place restrictions, but allow them to establish a trading enclave elsewhere."
 nhs2_countryevents.49.b:0 "We shall allow free trade."

 nhs2_countryevents.51.d:0 "After many decades of searching, our explorers believe that they have found evidence of Byzantine activity. Numerous sightings of large, European style ships have been reported, far beyond what the natives of the new world are capable of building. An official delegation is being organised as we speak, and will depart for the new world immediately.  "
 nhs2_countryevents.51.a:0 "Prepare an official delegation!"
 
 nhs2_countryevents.52.t:0 "Portuguese Explorers Arrive"
 nhs2_countryevents.52.d:0 "A small fleet of Portuguese ships were discovered off our shores today. After anchoring off the coast of one of our major port cities, we received a group of emissaries, one of whom spoke some Greek, which was close enough to Elysian that we could converse. They say that while most of Europe had given up on finding a new route to India after our supposed demise, the Portuguese used the knowledge we had given them and continued to send secret expeditions west in search of our fleet. They offer us a unique proposition, in return for exclusive access to our more exotic trade goods, they will introduce us to new technological advances from Europe. Of course, we could just prevent them from leaving and take their supplies for ourselves, though that won't stop them from sending more ships."
 nhs2_countryevents.52.a:0 "Establish a Portuguese enclave, keeping them isolated from our people."
 nhs2_countryevents.52.b:0 "We can't trust these barbarians! Send those fools away!"

 nhs2_countryevents.53.d:0 "Our delegation has returned with great news, the Byzantines, who now call themselves 'Elysians' have signed a treaty allowing our traders to establish a small enclave, giving us exclusive trade rights in return for access to the latest European technology."

 nhs2_countryevents.54.d:0 "Our delegation has returned with unfortunate news, the Byzantines, who now call themselves 'Elysians' have rejected our proposal and sent them away. While this is unfortunate news, we are nonetheless grateful to the Elysians for telling us about their discoveries, and will not reveal their presence to the rest of Europe."
 nhs2_countryevents.54.a:0 "At least not yet."
 
 nhs2_countryevents.55.t:0 "Expedition Missing"
 nhs2_countryevents.55.d:0 "It has been some time since our delegation left for the new world, and it has still not returned. While some believed that they may have been lost in a storm or shipwrecked, subsequent scouting missions intercepted messages signed by the so called 'Elysian Emperor' that had ordered Portuguese ships destroyed on sight."
 nhs2_countryevents.55.a:0 "We will not forget this!"
 
 nhs2_countryevents.56.t:0 "Treaty of Lathanopolis"
 nhs2_countryevents.56.d:0 "In the years since we made contact with the Portuguese, they have taken to exploring the oceans with unexpected zeal. Recent breakthroughs in ship design have allowed them to explore and map the northern coastline of the great continent to the south. The Elysian senate is wary of unchecked Portuguese expansion, and as such has invited them to sign the 'Treaty of Lathanopolis', which would restrict Portuguese settlement to that continent. In return, their colony would receive the protection of the Elysian navy in addition to regular supply shipments. Alternatively we could allow them to settle wherever they wish, which would no doubt ingratiate them to us if nothing else."
 nhs2_countryevents.56.a:0 "It is signed then."
 nhs2_countryevents.56.b:0 "Let them do as they wish."

Ships full of eager colonists are ready to depart from Lisbon, all that remains is to choose a site for the colonial capital."
 nhs2_countryevents.57.a:0 "At the mouth of a great river."

Ships from all over Europe are arriving en mass, both to trade for exotic Elysian goods and to explore this new world. The Portuguese are concerned about this, reminding us that we signed a treaty giving them exclusive trading rights."
