 CHG_ideas: "Chagatai Ideas"
 CHG_ideas_start: "Chagatai Traditions"
 CHG_ideas_bonus: "Chagatai Ambition"
 picking_up_the_pieces: "Picking up the Pieces"
 picking_up_the_pieces_desc: "The pieces of Central Asia are scattered and attempting to unite different places under themselves, but from our vantage point, we can see that it is all futile. Chagatai power is no where near what it used to be, but we must not be complacent with this situation! Chagatai power must and will be restored whether it be by diplomacy or by military authority!"
 unification_of_central_asia: "Unification of Central Asia"
 unification_of_central_asia_desc: "The great Mongol Empire is long gone and so is its most notable successor, the Yuan Dynasty. What remains in the wake of this breakup is a mess of sorts, but nothing that we can't remedy with by properly asserting and enforcing Mongol authority once again. It will be a long journey, but Central Asia will be our foundation for greater ambitions."
 modernize_and_adapt: "Modernize and Adapt"
 modernize_and_adapt_desc: "The age of Khans and cavalry armies are fading into the distant past and it seems obvious that the age of kings and queens, emperors and empresses, and dukes and duchesses are upon us. Chagatai leadership will need to adapt to outside forces influencing our society and our administration by not simply holding onto the traditions of the past forever, but by attempting to reform certain parts of the nation and make peace with what new technologies and concepts lay ahead."
 quick_and_vicious_movement: "Quick and Vicious Movement"
 quick_and_vicious_movement_desc: "Part of the traditions we were left with from the times of the Mongol Empire was the notion of quick and efficient movement of armies, though, most of them back then were composed of cavalry. Even so, today we can impart these ideas on our current military and move from places to place, town to town, and fortress to fortress much quicker than our enemies can."
 mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters: "Mediate Islam and Buddhist Encounters"
 mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters_desc: "The paths through Central Asia are filled not with either fully Buddhist nor fully Islamic communities, though, they do come in contact with each other quite frequently in Chagatai lands. By helping the two religions converse and debate with each other in a peaceful manner, we can ease tensions within Chagatai lands when it comes to religious differences."
 silk_road_trade: "Silk Road Trade"
 silk_road_trade_desc: "Trading with those of the Silk Road, even though it is far from what it used to be in the past, has helped the people of Chagatai prosper and learn of various ideas, including mercenary contracts. It should not be surprising that what we contribute to the Silk Road is also returned to us, just in a different and sometimes even better form, such as cheaper mercenaries."
 reform_the_mongol_empire: "Reform the Mongol Empire"
 reform_the_mongol_empire_desc: "The legacy is larger than life, some say; impossible to fully reclaim, as said by others. Ah, but these people do not know of the power within the Chagatai people, nor do they have the confidence. It will be a meticulous and time-consuming process, but through the blood of many and through times of both peace and war, those of the Chagatai nation will come to reclaim the mantle of the Mongol Empire!"
 NOG_ideas: "Nogai Ideas"
 NOG_ideas_start: "Nogai Traditions"
 NOG_ideas_bonus: "Nogai Ambition"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols: "Confederation of Turkic and Mongol Tribes"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols_desc: "The Nogai Horde was originally a gathering and eventual confederation of about 18 Turkic and Mongol tribes. They formed a powerful and distinct force in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and presented a serious challenge to regional authority from the likes of the Golden Horde."
 the_manghits: "The Manghits"
 the_manghits_desc: "The Manghits were a Mongol tribe that formed a foundational core for our people. Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay: "Centralize the Nogai People"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."
 weak_religious_institutions: "Weak Religious Institutions"
 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."
 khanate_rivalries: "Khanate Rivals"
 khanate_rivalries_desc: "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit. There may only be one with absolute authority out in our homeland, all others are and will be either rivals or subjects!"
 keep_nomadic_traditions: "Keep our Nomadic Traditions"
 keep_nomadic_traditions_desc: "Our nomadic origins aren't easy to change or get rid of; the act of raiding and pillaging hostile land and bringing back loot to our tribes is something we inherited and something we cannot and will not simply give up."
 fluid_political_organization: "Fluid Political Organization"
 fluid_political_organization_desc: "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors. If anything, the way we conduct our politics will help keep our people loyal and content."
 OIR_ideas: "Oirat Ideas"
 OIR_ideas_start: "Oirat Traditions"
 OIR_ideas_bonus: "Oirat Ambition"
 four_major_tribes: "Four Major Tribes"
 four_major_tribes_desc: "The Oirat Horde is dominated by four tribes: the Dzungar, the Torghut, the Dorbet, and the Khoshut. The unification of these tribes means that military matters are able to be handled separately and with both grace and efficiency; we must work to keep these four united and working together so that our power does not wane."
 memory_of_temujin: "Memories of Temujin"
 memory_of_temujin_desc: "Temujin Ghengis made the world tremble before him and his cavalry, but before he ventured out of the region of Mongolia, he first had to contend with various Mongol tribes, such as those that now make up the Oirat Horde. We still hold the memories of the 13th century conquests as something to retrace and the legacy that it left behind, something to be tamed once more... Who else but the Oirat people could see to it that these memories are made a reality once more?"
 ming_rivalry: "Ming Rivalry"
 ming_rivalry_desc: "Our rivalry with the imposters down south, the so-called, 'Ming Dynasty', is nothing short of being on the verge of war at every moment. They desecrated and forced back our Mongolian relatives and now proclaim to be entering into an age of renewed strength, but little do they know that dissenters are spread far and wide throughout Zhongguo (China)! We will take these dissenters and rebels into our ranks and train them ourselves so that we may field them against the Ming Dynasty when war comes upon us."
 fall_of_the_yuan: "Fall of the Yuan Dynasty"
 fall_of_the_yuan_desc: "Founded by Kublai Khan in 1272 and driven out by the Red Turban Rebellion by 1370, then Yuan Dynasty was perhaps the greatest successor to the Mongol Empire established by Temujin. The Oirat Horde are the only serious claimant that might still hold enough power to retake the land the Yuan Dynasty once had. Should the heavens favor us in this endeavor, we can proclaim as the true successors to the Yuan Dynasty and forever seal away the likes of the Ming Dynasty."
 past_the_great_wall: "Past the Great Wall"
 past_the_great_wall_desc: "The Hongwu Emperor and the Yongle Emperor sought to rebuild and revamp the Great Wall in the late 14th century/early 15th century in order to keep the threat of us at bay, but we are nothing if not clever in finding ways around these defenses (or perhaps instead, through these defenses). We will innovate and adjust our tactics to ensure that these fortifications along the north do not stop the horde of cavalry from storming south into the heartland of Zhongguo."
 religious_indifference: "Religious Indifference"
 religious_indifference_desc: "If there is something to be said about religion in the Oirat Horde, it is that it is quite open and free from persecution. We have our own faith, but it is not expected of others to convert and learn of our traditions from the ground up, that would only instill unrest and distrust in people. Rather, a fair amount of religious indifference is key to keeping our people united."
 unification_of_the_mongols: "Unification of the Mongols"
 unification_of_the_mongols_desc: "The Mongols are not simply content with being divided up by foreign powers and pushed back to the steppe. The Oirat Horde retains the ambition to unite the several scattered Mongol tribes into one grand empire that can make the world bow beneath it, and it is the Oirat Horde that shall make this happen."
 SHY_ideas: "Uzbek Ideas"
 SHY_ideas_start: "Uzbek Traditions"
 SHY_ideas_bonus: "Uzbek Ambition"
 reign_over_many_tribes: "Rulership over several Tribes"
 reign_over_many_tribes_desc: "The vast part of the steppe that we claim as the Uzbek domain is full of different tribes whose loyalty, at times, is questionable at best. They do, however, have connection toward different regions where different rulers and khans live; through these tribal ties, we can bolster our own name and reputation from the ground up."
 degrading_golden_horde_influence: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc: "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."
 contest_over_southern_lands: "Southern Conflicts"
 contest_over_southern_lands_desc: "Land in Transoxiana was always rightfully part of the greater Shaybanid domain, but the likes of Timur and his people contested these claims and sought to tear it away. If we are to keep our claim to being the rightful heir the Shaybanid domain, these conflicts in the south must result in Uzbek victory in time."
 settle_issues_with_tribes: "Settle our Internal Issues"
 settle_issues_with_tribes_desc: "The many tribes within the Shaybanid domain are not always peaceful and often times disputes between them, or disputes with them and the governing body, result in often bloody feuds that can destabilize entire parts of our nation. It is time that we organize formal places (buildings, perhaps) where representatives or leaders of tribes meet to discuss and mediate problems they have with each other. The results are bound to shed less blood, much less than prior ones before, at least."
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain: "Consolidate the Shaybanid Domain"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc: "The vast stretches of land we rule across have towns and villages dotting the landscape. They may be few and far between, but we can make them the starting points of proper Uzbek settlments that we can either properly tax or draft soldiers from. It is a matter of centralization over decentralization."
 abulkharids: "The Abulkharids"
 abulkharids_desc: "The Abulkharids are a distinct branch of the larger Shaybanid Dynasty and one of its most famous rulers, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, helped solidify Uzbek dominance across the larger Shaybanid domain. It is through the Abulkharids that we find a solid foundation for unity and strength, and it is by them that at least part of our people are held together."
 ascend_from_nomadic_life: "Ascend from Nomadic Life"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc: "The way of the steppe nomads is not what is used to be. Increasingly there are institutions and nations propagating said institutions that chip away at the foundation of our ancestors way of life. Perhaps it is time for the Uzbek people to settle down and start a new life as a more agrarian people, rather than a nomadic people."
 JIN_ideas: "Jin Ideas"
 JIN_ideas_start: "Jin Traditions"
 JIN_ideas_bonus:  "Jin Ambition"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
 battle_against_former_qin: "The Former Qin"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
 manipulation_of_taoism: "Manipulate Taoism"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "War of the Eight Princes"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
 the_five_barbarians: "The Five Barbarians"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 SHU_ideas: "Shu Ideas"
 SHU_ideas_start: "Shu Traditions"
 SHU_ideas_bonus: "Shu Ambition"
 ancient_shu_state: "Ancient Shu State"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
 zhuge_liang: "Zhuge Liang"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
 defensive_position: "Defensive Position"
 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
 connections_through_trade: "Trade Connections"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 WUU_ideas: "Wun Ideas"
 WUU_ideas_start: "Wun Traditions"
 WUU_ideas_bonus: "Wun Ambition"
 history_of_independence: "History of Independence"
 history_of_independence_desc: "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
 waters_of_wu: "The Waters of Wu"
 waters_of_wu_desc: "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy."
 three_kingdoms_period: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_desc: "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
 promote_coastal_trade: "Promote Coastal Trade"
 promote_coastal_trade_desc: "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via trade?"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period: "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
 the_sun_dynasty: "The Sun Dynasty"
 the_sun_dynasty_desc: "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu. It is through the continuation of the Sun Dynasty that Wu will prosper and maintain itself as a grand and propserous region in China."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 CHC_ideas: "Chu Ideas"
 CHC_ideas_start: "Chu Traditions"
 CHC_ideas_bonus: "Chu Ambition"
 foundation_in_myths: "Foundations in Myths"
 foundation_in_myths_desc: "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
 control_over_central_china: "Control over Central China"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "The Spring and Autumn Period"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
 take_on_gov_corruption: "Take on Government Corruption"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
 qin_chu_rivalry: "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."
 stop_internal_decadence: "Stop Internal Decadence"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "A main facet of our culture in the Spring and Autumn Period and in the subsequent Warring States Period was just how relaxed and laid-back our culture was, so much so that it began to affect society on a much larger scale. Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 battle_of_toulouse_721: "Battle of Toulouse, 721AD"
 battle_of_toulouse_721_desc: "When the Umayyad Caliphate was seeking to invade north into Frankish territory, it was Odo of Aquiitaine who righteously defended the land of Toulouse at this pivotal battle in 721AD. We must remember this historic moment in our history and keep it close to us as we move on throughout time."
 treaty_of_paris_1229: "Treaty of Paris, 1229AD"
 treaty_of_paris_1229_desc: "This treaty was the one in which our region, Occitania, lost its political autonomy and was annexed into the French domain. This wasn't a violent annexation, however, but a sign of our way of marrying into other nations and gaining influence from the inside. Granted, this treaty cost us dearly, we will make sure in the future that marriages and dynastic unions go firmly our way."
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade: "Revenge for our Ancestors"
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade_desc: "The Albigensian Crusade some time ago was a great loss for our people. The wretched Catholics from the north and the Pope himself calling for the execution of the Cathar faith as a whole led to our downfall and it has been hard to recover ever since. It is time we take matters into our own hands and make sure others know that the Albigensian Crusade has not been forgotten."
 the_cathar_faith: "The Cathar Faith"
 the_cathar_faith_desc: "Catharism was rife in Toulouse and Languedoc in the 12th to 14th century, but the Albigensian Crusade put a harsh and bloody blade to the throat of it. Now that Catharism is resurging, we must promote it and take solace in its teachings."
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture: "Occitain Culture"
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture_desc: "A key facet of our culture? Troubadours and and the Occitan language. With both in use as well as the French and Catalan languages mixed in as well, the great culture of Occitania can be the envy of the world and make our nation into a true spectacle on the world stage."
 distinct_identity_from_the_north: "Distinct Identity"
 distinct_identity_from_the_north_desc: "We must remember how different we are from the French people to the north. A distinct language, culture, faith, we are separate from them in so many key ways and we should be proud of it. Our righteous leader will be the prime promoter of our identity no matter what happens to us."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 successor_to_the_visigoths: "Successor to the Visigoths"
 successor_to_the_visigoths_desc: "In the 7th to 8th centuries, Aquitaine was subjected to the likes of Roman and Visigothic laws that meshed together to create a sort of hybrid system of administration that did us well. Looking back on this combination of laws and not only reforming it, but codifying it as well, could do the entire nation good."
 carolingian_legacy: "Carolingian Legacy"
 carolingian_legacy_desc: "The complex system of dynasties and counts and fiefdoms inside the Frankish realm was undoubtedly tough to navigate, but the nobles of Aquitaine managed to make prominent strides within it after Pepin I, one of the sons of Charlemagne, and were granted the lands of Aquitaine in 814AD. It is now part of our duty to defend this land with all that we've got, keeping the legacy of our ancestors safe and ensuring our own safety in the process."
 eleanor_of_aquitaine: "Eleanor of Aquitaine"
 eleanor_of_aquitaine_desc: "Perhaps our best known figure, Eleanor of the house of of Poiters and the inheritor of Aquitaine after her father's death navigated the political heights of England and France in the 12th century and kept Aquitaine in good care by her diplomatic and marrital actions. Even though her death lent our land to England's King Henry II, the memory of her and her actions live on."
 100_years_war_memories: "Memories of the 100 Years War"
 100_years_war_memories_desc: "The terror and horror of the 100 Years War has taught the Aquitanian people many things, one of the foremost being that, we simply cannot and will not neglect our military."
 english_and_french_influences: "English and French Influences"
 english_and_french_influences_desc: "England and France have both tried their hands at taking over Aquitaine and securing it firmly, but such a thing is undoubtedly hard to do. Since we have experiences with both, however, we can take this time to reflect and learn from both sides. Though both England and France may have different styles of administrating land, dealing with inheritance, and levying taxes and what-not, we can still learn and take advantage of them, can't we?"
 fertility_of_aquitaine: "Fertility of Aquitaine"
 fertility_of_aquitaine_desc: "Our lands are quite rich in agricultural potential and we've capitalized on this in the past. By continuing to do so, we can cultivate a growing population and in turn, a large reserve of soldiers for our own defense, or our own invasions."

No decisive winner in the past has brought about peace between us two, but without a doubt this feud has led to people joining the ranks of the Shammari military to fight against them.

 legacy_of_promoting_christianity_desc: "Ever since we started out, we've been staunch promoters of Christianity to those who were distinctly not Christian. As such, we've learned various ways to help promote our faith via incentives, debates, coercion, and other matters. Some methods may not be pretty, others may go on without any issue, but we will get the job done."
 settle_internal_matters: "Settle Internal Matters"
 settle_internal_matters_desc: "The various conflicts between secular and religious authorities in our land is nothing new.

 consolidate_the_districts: "Consolidate the Districts"
 consolidate_the_districts_desc: "Communities throuhgout Madgeburg are varying in their origin and background, but they all contribute to the administration as a whole.

 legacy_of_the_great_saxon_revolt_desc: "When the Saxon people revolted in the 12th century, we sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and as such, helped suppress the revolt altogether. We were justly rewarded for our assistance and we gained prominence in the Holy Roman Empire because of it, thus attracting more great minds to our land than before. Today, we continue this tradition rightly and our court is ever the more grand because of it."
 defensive_stance: "Defensive Stance"
 defensive_stance_desc: "Taking the offensive stance is something Magdeburg has rarely ever done. We have been much more focused on internal affairs for quite some time and with such things being sorted, we can focus on ensuring that our defenses are primed and ready. Any invader who comes at the people of Magdeburg will leave in a much worse state than when they came."
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed: "Choosing a Path"
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed_desc: "The Catholic Church is rife with contention and the Protestant Reformation is forcing everyone to choose sides and denominations.

 former_hindu_center_desc: "The memories of our land being a center of Hinduism is not lost upon us. The beliefs spread by people from centuries still affect us to this day and the shrines and writings from back then remind us of how we must tolerate those of different faiths within our lands. Without a tolerant outlook towards these people, Kedah would be stuck in a constant cycle of strife and destruction."
 influences_from_srivijaya: "Influences from Srivijaya"
 influences_from_srivijaya_desc: "The once mighty empire of Srivijaya stretched its influence far into the north and south, reaching even our lands in Kedah.

 chola_empire_influences: "Influences from the Chola Empire"
 chola_empire_influences_desc: "The ships and merchants from the Chola Empire taught the Malay people a great many things about trade routes and mercantile ways, much of which still remain with our people. By utilizing what they've taught our people from so long ago and building upon it, Kedah will be able to garner more power from simply trade routes and trade sectors alone."
 quality_army_of_kedah: "High Quality Army"
 quality_army_of_kedah_desc: "The military of Kedah is something that shouldn't be overlooked. For too long we have relied on tactics and stratagies from foreign states where they swear allegiance to foreign lords. Kedah must come up with its own unique tactics and stratagies so that its troops will be of the highest quality compared to neighboring states, and states from far away."
 confluence_of_giants: "At the Confluence of Giants"
 confluence_of_giants_desc: "From the north, the Thai kingdoms reign supreme, one after another. From the south, kingdoms and smaller states rock the jungles and waters alike to show dominance. Kedah is at the crossroads of both regions and as a result, hears and witnesses some of these great nations do battle. Kedah and its people must watch and learn carefully as they clash, so that the military of Kedah can build up its own measures against what is currently employed in battle."
 promote_kedah_merchants: "Promote Kedah Merchants"
 promote_kedah_merchants_desc: "As the prominence of Kedah increases, so to do our merchants. In a bid to increase our trade dominance, promoting our own merchants seems like an obvious measure we should take, and one we will actively pursue in the coming time periods. If we don't capitalize on the valuable trade opportunities, our rivals surely will, and we simply must not let that happen."
 protect_the_coasts: "Protect the Coasts"
 protect_the_coasts_desc: "The coastline of Kedah grows ever larger the more we conquer. Thus, the coastal settlements of Kedah deserve protection from foreign ships and amphibious invasions, necessitating the building of a grand fleet of ships capable of driving off any would-be invasion force. Our military will be capable of holding the fortifications and communities down, it is the waters around our land that we must worry about now."

 legacy_of_the_investiture_controversy_desc: "The controversy that led to Pinamonte Bonacolsi taking power in 1273 as Captain General of the People was named the Investiture Controversy and we should count ourselves thankful for it. Mantua, under Pinamonte and his family, grew to be quite prosperous and grand to all states around at the time. It wasn't until 1328 that the last Bonacolsi was ousted from power by the House of Gonzaga, but the legacy left by the Investiture Controversy will never be forgotten by us."

 backroom_deals_desc: "Bribery, coercion, threats, they all fall under the category of 'making deals happen'... They just, take a different approach to making such deals go through. Mantua is no stranger to dealing in these matters and must continue to do so so that it can continue to come out on top of diplomatic endeavors."
 episcopal_influences: "Episcopal Influences"
 episcopal_influences_desc: "Being situated in the Italian Peninsula gives us opportunities for a myriad of things, one of which is episcopal influence from the Papacy itself. Though we don't wish to fall under direct authority from the Papal States themselves, more religious authority in the lands of Mantua is most always nice to have."
 the_gonzagas: "The Gonzagas"
 the_gonzagas_desc: "Whether or not the Gonzagas have been good for Mantua is up for debate, but it is safe to say that they've been a stabilizing influence in communities around the land itself. It would be best for us not to stifle them out of Mantua entirely since they do call our land home, at least in part."
 mercenary_connections: "Mercenary Connections"
 mercenary_connections_desc: "The vast underground network of mercenary camps and regiments is rife with contracts ready to be taken up and ready to be offered out. Since we are no stranger to using hired soldiers, our reputation with many mercenary groups is better than other nations around us, granting us better rates overall."

 protect_mantua_desc: "It is not a want, but a need. The people of Mantua must be protected from the authorities outside its borders.

 remember_the_sarir_dynasty_desc: "One of the first positions of power our people came into was called Sarir. Lasting from about the 5th century to the 12th century, it saw great developments for the Avar people and the cementing of the Avar people in the Caucuses. To this day, we still do claim to be descended from  the Sarir state, although in a different form, giving us legitimacy in the eyes of the Avarian people."

 wars_of_the_caucuses_desc: "The hills and mountains by which we call home are by no means easy to live in, let alone wage war in. Yet, time and time again, the Avar people have routinely fought in these harsh conditions, seeking to maintain their own identity and their own state. It is through these conflicts that we've learned to fend off attrition better, aiding us in prolonged conflicts that see the Avarian people and troops being pushed to the edge."
 alliance_shifts: "Alliance Shifts"
 alliance_shifts_desc: "We've seen several states rise and fall throughout our history in the Caucuses. In order to secure our own safety, we've had to ally various powers from the north, the south, the east, and the west, causing us to have to engage in alliances and diplomacy on all sides. As this is still the case, we must be ready to do this all over again and safeguard our independence by diplomatic means."

 revenge_against_gazikumukh_desc: "The Gazikumukh Samkhalate have claimed to be the rulers of the Avar people and the lands that Avar hold for some time now. Though we vehemently detest this and have tried to fight them off, we failed in the past and were forced into subjugation. One day, though, we can and will have our revenge against the tyrannical power that is Gazikumukh, and the Avar will breathe the air of their ancestors: the air of independence."
 stave_off_the_external_threats: "External Threats"
 stave_off_the_external_threats_desc: "The threats outside of the Caucuses are great and numerous; almost every culture in the region knows it as they've seen numerous invaders come by over the centuries. If the Avar people are to be different, if they are to be ready for these invasions when they come around, adopting improved military technology and bolstering our military potential should be a top priority."
 lessons_of_the_caucuses: "Lessons of the Caucuses"
 lessons_of_the_caucuses_desc: "Such is the terrain that we call home, mountains and hills on the northern side of the Caucuses, that invaders often find little room for supply trains on top of sturdy defensive positions that are well built and well stocked. This will continue to be the case and how we set up defenses in our homeland will be a model for how we set up defensive positions elsewhere."
 cultures_of_the_caucuses: "Cultures of the Caucuses"
 cultures_of_the_caucuses_desc: "There are several distinct languages, cultures, traditions, and customs here in the Caucuses. From the Alans to the Circassians to the Georgians and many others, we know that they all desire to be left autonomous in some way and accepted for who they are. Being as one from this group of distinct cultures situated in the vast mountains, we can empathize and sympathize with these various groups and come to accept them into our own domain, even though the same was not always done to our people in the past."

 rival_of_central_italy_desc: "The various powers of Italy are all attempting to cut each other down in some way, shape, or form in order to gain the upper hand and we've seen this go on for upwards of centuries now. Lucca must take these lessons from past conflicts and use them to improve its own military expertise, as well as its own overall potential as a nation in Italy."

 patronize_renaissance_thinkers_desc: "The Renaissance blossomed all around us and within the lands of Lucca, giving rise to great thinkers, writers, philosophers, and innovators.

 republic_in_sea_of_monarchies_desc: "There are few in Italy, and indeed all of Europe, that think like the Luccans do.

 receeding_hre_influences: "Receeding Holy Roman Empire Influences"
 receeding_hre_influences_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire tried to maintain control over Italy and the minor states within it, but we've been feeling the waning authority of its emperors for some time now. Luccan people no longer should pay fealty to such a far-away lord of different culture, different tongue, and different governing structure; and now that other states are free from the grip of that terrible political project, land will be easier to acquire from our enemies."
 take_on_republican_reforms: "Take on Republican Reforms"
 take_on_republican_reforms_desc: "As time goes on and our ideals slowly evolve due to the coming about of new technologies and ideas, the government of Lucca must be ready to reform itself in various ways when the need arises. Taking on such reforms undoubtedly leads to corrupt connections rising up, but we are going to crack down on these suspected corrupt persons and ensure the stability and smooth-flowing nature of the Republic of Lucca."

 merovingian_legacy: "Merovingian Legacy"
 merovingian_legacy_desc: "The Merovingian dynasty took special interest in Frankfurt as a city. The mighty Charlemagne himself built a royal court here and performed certain ceremonies and held important meetings during his reign at Frankfurt itself. The prominence of Frankfurt woulud continue on throughout the Merovingian lineage of successors and with their influence in Frankfurt's ancestry, none will be surprised when we come to reclaim what is rightfully belonging to us."
 policing_the_streets: "Policing the Streets"
 policing_the_streets_desc: "We empoly a variety of guardians and military protectors within the main city of frankfurt in order to keep order and stability within it. This system of policing the streets regularly and with intent and purpose should be expanded upon as time goes on, and should we acquire more land, the system can also be employed elsewhere."
 an_army_for_frankfurt: "An Army for Frankfurt"
 an_army_for_frankfurt_desc: "To defend out city, its prestige, its legitimacy, its grandeur and prominence all at once, we will need a true military force to assert some sort of power internally and externally. A more unified populace will be the first stepping stone to making this happen."

 encourage_scientific_intrigue_desc: "Due to the significance of Frankfurt as a place of trade and commercial interests, great minds (artists, investors, thinkers, writers, etc.) are coming through our town and sharing their valuable knowledge with a myriad of locals. By settling them here in the city and funding their more science-leaning endeavors, we can pursue more innovative technological advances."
 compound_upon_previous_military_tactics: "Better Military Tactics"
 compound_upon_previous_military_tactics_desc: "The decades of military conflict we've seen around us and also been involved in has taught the people of Frankfurt many lessons.

Though we may not have been able to stop the Christinization of our people, we certainly have been able to stop (or at least slow) the influence of the Livonian Order upon the Livonian people. It is our duty now to take revenge upon the foul crusader order and drive them into the annals of history."

 the_remaining_baltic_tribes_desc: "What remains of the old Baltic tribes from before the Livonian Order, they are few and far between but they are still around.

 livonian_population_resurgence_desc: "The original people of the Baltic region are slowly retaking the land they once lost. Those from the old tribes are coming back in larger numbers as the generations go by, and our communities are becoming more expansive as time goes on.

 curionian_semigallian_latgallian_fighters_desc: "The fall of the several Baltic tribes to the crusders was not without bloodshed on both sides. The Curonians, Semigallians, Latgalians, and Selonians all resisted the incoming armored knights baring crosses, and this fighting spirit within them is not lost, even to this very day. By recruiting these people into our ranks, the Livonian military will be a true threat to those around us."
 reaching_out: "Reaching Out"
 reaching_out_desc: "With our foundations settled and our nation becoming a unique entity, the Livonian people would do well to open themselves up to contacting foreign people and foreign nations throughout the regions close to us.

 crusader_memories_desc: "The crusades of centuries past left a considerable mark upon Syrian history. The bastions they built up along with the conflicts they fought in the Levant and on Syrian land are remembered well by our people, but our people would be fools to only tell the tales of the crusades and not learn from them. Using what they left behind and engineering tight and sound defensive structures like they did will allow us to withstand invasion after invasion."

 ethnicities_in_and_around_syria_desc: "There are several people coming and going from Syria, some whom choose to settle in the land.

The royalty, the nobility, and even a good portion of the peasants have come to us with lofty goals of living in a strong and secure Syrian nation, but do we have the resources to make this dream a reality?

 cradle_of_great_cities: "Cradle of Great Cities"
 cradle_of_great_cities_desc: "The great ancient cities like Assur and Babylonia still retain remnants in Mesopotamia, despite them being faint as of today.

We have taken careful measures to style them to our own liking and to make them stand out, attracting religious scholars and minds from around Anatolia and even parts of Arabia, the Levant, and other regions. With this in mind, we can become a bastion of Islam in the west if we so choose, and perhaps we should."

 take_on_anatolian_trade: "Take on Anatolian Trade"
 take_on_anatolian_trade_desc: "The trade routes of Anatolia and its coastal areas offer strategic interests for Mentese and its merchants as well as its administrators. If we are able to direct more trade into our land and profit off of it then we will undoubtedly be able to monopolize the trade in time and eventually make Mentese a commercial hub unlike any other. Still, this will take time to do and we must be careful with how we approach this matter."

Our contacts with the Turkomans, Georgians, as well as other groups of people have allowed us to formalize effective mercenary deals over time and with them in our arsenal, we can ensure a steady supply hired guns that can replace our own men in battle."
 uyghur_mongol_foundations: "Uyghur and Mongol Foundation"
 uyghur_mongol_foundations_desc: "Our founder, Eretna, was originally a Mongol officer and traced his lineage back to the Uyghurs themselves.

 after_the_decline_of_rum_desc: "After the Sultanate of Rum went into decline, we were one of the beyliks to prove ourselves capable of securing positions of power and territories of importance. We must never forget how we came about and we must strive to maintain Germiyanid power throughout the ages."
 rivals_of_karaman: "Rivals of Karaman"
 rivals_of_karaman_desc: "The Karamanids were one our most prominent rivals. Though we may have been bested by them in a few ways during our more powerful years, we are still willing to learn from these mistakes of ours, and from them, we will build a more refined structure the Germiyanids."
 ilkhanid_influences: "Ilkhanid Influences"
 ilkhanid_influences_desc: "The Ilkhanate held great influence in Anatolia for a short time, but with that influence came with it the influence of more cavalry-oriented military tactics. It is something we keep true to ourselves despite the Ilkhanate no longer being around and the age of purely cavalry-based armies being over."
 subjugate_the_coastal_beyliks: "Subjugate the Coastal Beyliks"
 subjugate_the_coastal_beyliks_desc: "The coast=s are where we faltered when we first came about. Our once loyal military leaders who led expeditions to the coasts revolted against our authority and successfully broke away, leading to our decline. The times have changed, however, and we will work to see these coastal areas returned to the rightful authority that they belong to: The Germiyanids."
 rein_in_unruly_commanders: "Rein in Unruly Commands"
 rein_in_unruly_commanders_desc: "The command structure of our military is something that lacks real cohesion and merit and its evident when commanders become too powerful and seek to actively disobey our orders. This will be no more in the future and we will enforce a new system, rigid and meritocratic and working to keep military options for Germiyan open and viable."
 western_beylik: "Western Beylik"
 western_beylik_desc: "Since we are situated closer to the western edge of Anatolia, we are more foten in touch with scholars and cultured minds of Europe who bring with them interesting ideas that we have yet to come across. It would do Germiyan well to have these minds be welcome into our land rather than turned away altogether."

 beyond_anatolia_desc: "Us, of Dulkadir, are on the edge of Anatolia. To the east lies uncertain potential and danger, but perhaps it holds more opportunity than harm for us if we can navigate the political and diplomatic swamp that swirls around us. It will not be easy, but it is most certainly worth a try."
 buffer_state: "Buffer State"
 buffer_state_desc: "Dulkadir is seen merely as a buffer state in the midst of the 15th century, but there is potential in us hidden deep within. In order to draw that potential out, however, we will need time and resources and in that time, there will be those who want to put a sword to our throat, slashing with mercy. It is our duty to defend what is rightfully Dulkadiri in nature until the time is right to lash out in rigthteous conquest."
 promote_the_dynasty: "Promote the Dynasty"
 promote_the_dynasty_desc: "The dynasty of Dulkadir is one that knows how to spread into other courts. We have connections to other nations around us through marriages and other means, many of which stem from our royal family. If we keep this going and maintain the foundation of the dynasty within Dulkadiri lands, we'll be better set externally as well as internally."
 oghuz_connections: "Oghuz Connections"
 oghuz_connections_desc: "Our ancestors were (and sometimes still are) called the 'Oghuz Turks'. Though seemingly scattered and separated, there are several bands of them still roaming about, serving as mercenaries throughout the lands around us. If we can cooperate with them and perhaps formalize contracts with them, Dulkadir can ensure itself a steady stream of mercenaries for future wars."
 mamluk_ties: "Mamluk Ties"
 mamluk_ties_desc: "The Mamluk Sultanate to our south is something of a worry in more ways than one, but we hold connections to them since many of the trade routes that go to them pass through our land directly. Cultivating this connection over time, even if the Mamluk Sultanate dies out, will result in not only great external assurance, but also internal benefits as well."
 extending_our_influence: "Extending our Influence"
 extending_our_influence_desc: "As the years go by, Dulkadir finds itself growing more and more aware of how far its influence goes in the world around it. Extending it more so will take more effort and must be calculated accordingly so as to not fail later on.

 core_at_adana_desc: "The fertile fields of Adana are where we have chosen to have our capital at, and its defensive position at the southern part of the Tarsus Mountains makes it an ideal place for us to build our power up from. From here, it we will have a nice and strong foundation for our future with whatever it may hold."
 destroyers_of_cilicia: "Destroyers of Cilicia"
 destroyers_of_cilicia_desc: "When we came through to Adana, we destroyed the last remnants of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia.

 tensions_with_mamluk_sultanate_desc: "The Levant and Egypt itself are in the control of the Mamluk Sultanate. Though there are times where we cooperate with them, there is undoubtedly a sense of tension between us and them. We must be on watch and be ready to take action whenever they are weak, or whenever they feel as though attacking us is a good idea."
 adana_buffer: "Adana Buffer"
 adana_buffer_desc: "Our lands are not only a crossing point between the regions of Anatolia and the Levant, but it is also inherently valuable as a defensive position to plot and launch an invasion from as well as a place to help control the trade routes of the Eastern Mediterranean. It would do us good if utilized Adana to its full extent and began recruiting men for a larger and more formal army that only the Ramazani people could train and maintain."
 settle_the_land: "Settle the Land"
 settle_the_land_desc: "The land of Adana remains largely untapped in its potential for agriculture and other resources. If we take to settling more of our people properly and with formal land grants and property rights, we can make much better use of Adana over time and extract a greater amount of wealth in the future."
 turkish_settlers: "Turkish Settlers"
 turkish_settlers_desc: "Turkish people have come through to settle the lands for upwards of a many generations now. The other cultures of the region are beginning to assimilate into the great Turkish culture which is nothing but good for the Ramazani people.

 raids_at_sea_desc: "The rulers of the Aydin Beylik were infamous for their raids along the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea. Who are we to stop doing what our ancestors did in the past? It's a profitable and a worthy endeavor, espeically when the ones we are raiding are simply undeserving of prosperity and wealth, unlike us."
 naval_power_from_smyrna: "Naval Power from Smyrna"
 naval_power_from_smyrna_desc: "Smyrna is where our naval power spread out from. Though it wasn't always in our hands, when it was, we made extensive use of it and made sure that all those within range of the city could feel our presence. Let us once again do as such and take on those who would try to take down the Aydinids."
 revenge_for_the_smyrniote_crusades: "Revenge for the Smyrniote Crusades"
 revenge_for_the_smyrniote_crusades_desc: "Two times did Pope Clement VI call for a crusade against our former leader, Umur Beg, for getting involved in the Byzantine Civil War of 1343-1351. Though the result was less than favorable for us, the Aydinids stayed strong and resisted the crusades to the very end in 1402. This example still inspires our people to this day, giving us hope to take revenge for what was done to us."
 securing_aegean_trade: "Securing Aegean Trade"
 securing_aegean_trade_desc: "The trade routes flowing through the Aegean Sea call to us, just asking to be raided, but they also call to us to be controlled for the interests of the Aydinids in general. Perhaps we can siphon income from the sea for ourselves and maybe elsewhere and pirate the rest that doesn't belong to us?"
 changes_from_tamerlane: "Changes from Tamerlane"
 changes_from_tamerlane_desc: "When Tamerlane came through and fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anatolia, we too were changed in many ways. It would do us good to learn from the invasion of Tamerlane and to innovate on what he did so that we too may be able to crush those who oppose us in the region."
 establish_aydinid_architecture: "Aydinid Architecture"
 establish_aydinid_architecture_desc: "The monuments we left behind from our founding are still around to this day, scattered around and slowly decaying without proper maintenance. We must revive the use of these mosques and trace back the roads to these monuments, and in the future, build more to our grandeur so that all may know who exactly the Aydinids are."

 sarukhan_bey_desc: "Our founder, Sarukhan Bey, long lived in his time, was the one who broke away from the Germiyanids and gave us actual power. Breaking away at the Gediz River and seizing considerable power for himself, the Saruhan Beylik would come to be quite powerful under his authority and we must strive to emulate this."
 emirate_of_germiyan: "Emirate of Germiyan"
 emirate_of_germiyan_desc: "Due to our ties to the Germiyanids, our court is occupied by scholars and courtiers of similar cultures. Even when we expand and incorporate different people into our court, we will be sure to privilege those of our tongue and customs over those unlike us so that we can have a more unified and less complex system of adivsors and scholars."
 great_mosque_at_manisa: "Great Mosque at Manisa"
 great_mosque_at_manisa_desc: "At Manisa lies a grand mosque built by our people. It's grandeur inspires faithful people from all over our land to come and worship at it whilst helping increase our piety as compared to other nations around us. Let this great mosque stand as a monument to all Saruhanid people and empower them ever further in their faith without failure."
 promote_naval_power: "Promote Naval Supremacy"
 promote_naval_power_desc: "The coastal areas in which we call our own are key to housing a fleet and ensuring that our part of the Aegean Sea is safely under our control. If we can make good on our naval supremacy from the past, nothing will stand in our way of obtaining hegemony over the waters."
 rival_of_the_byzantines: "Rivals of the Byzantines"
 rival_of_the_byzantines_desc: "We have had several contentions with teh Byzantines in the past and we remember them well. Skirmishes on land and at sea has led us to rethink and reform how we perform military tactics and strategy, giving us crucial insight into how we should be in the future."
 gunpowder_innovations: "Gunpowder Innovations"
 gunpowder_innovations_desc: "As time goes on, the Saruhanids are becoming more and more familiar with gunpowder weapons and their potential. By investing time and energy into refining them and perfecting them, perhaps nothing will stand in the way of the Saruhanids from obtaining absolute control of Anatolia and beyond. It's a lofty goal to think about, but it's a goal worth striving for."

 zoroastrian_legacy_desc: "The pious nature of the Yazdi people has been known since the time of the Sassanids. Though faiths change over time, the effort our people put into making their faith as true and as great as can be can be seen when Zoroastrianism was still dominant in Persia. Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."
 difficulties_of_yazd: "The Difficulties of Yazd"
 difficulties_of_yazd_desc: "Yazd is not only a difficult place to live, but it is also a difficult place to fight inside of. The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."
 capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty: "Former Capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty"
 capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty_desc: "The Muzaffarid Dynasty may have had but a brief life in Persia, but they had their capital at one point stationed in Yazd itself. Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."
 haven_in_persia: "Haven in Persia"
 haven_in_persia_desc: "For a long time now, we've been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere who are fleeing persecution or are in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."
 silk_weaving_industry: "Silk Weaving Industry"
 silk_weaving_industry_desc: "A commodity and wondrous material, silk, is readily produced in Yazd and its patterns and production are unique to Yazd itself (or so some say). We'd prefer to keep this silk production going as strong as possible, but to also not overwhelm our people with it, so we will need to balance out how production of it will scale in the future."
 sassanian_roots: "Sassanian Roots"
 sassanian_roots_desc: "Yazd itself is named after the Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire, Yazdegerd I. Throughout the times from the Sassanid Empire onwards, Yazd has been known as a sort of memorial or legacy place that the Sassanids left behind in their wake, and with that legitimacy backing us, we can be sure that people from around Persia will support our authority."
 uniting_persia: "Uniting Persia"
 uniting_persia_desc: "The pieces of Persia lay scattered and divided, fighting for dominance after the fall of Timur and in the face of threats from the north, west, and the east. However hard of a goal it might be to reach, the ambition to unite Persia once more under a single dynasty that is stable and righteous is what Yazd is set out to do. Time will tell if our ambition is to be fulfilled."

 nassau_castle_desc: "Our glorious castle is the ancestral seat of the House of Nassau. Keeping it in good condition and making it an example to follow for future fortifications we construct will not only bring our glory to the land we come to dominate, but also bring a sense of defensiveness to it that only we can provide."
 house_of_nassau: "The House of Nassau"
 house_of_nassau_desc: "With the House of Nassau being of the utmost prominence within our land, we must ensure that succession and legitimacy are not an issue to worry about. We must make good relationships with nobles and influential people around our realm so as to be sure that the House of Nassau is always viewed in a positive light."
 remember_count_adolf_of_nassau: "Count Adolf of Nassau"
 remember_count_adolf_of_nassau_desc: "Count Adolf of Nassau was elected Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298 and although he was weak in his authority due to the nature of the Holy Roman Empire and the electors wanting a weak emperor in the first place, his election brought about the land of Nassau onto the forefront of politics at the time. If we are to do this once more and bring Nassau to the forefront of matters throughout Central Europe, diplomacy must not be overlooked and being open and ready to whatever diplomatic intrigue that grants favor our way must be welcome by Nassau."
 dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 dynastic_politics_desc: "The nature of dynasties being intertwined with politics is nothing new to us, and if we utilize our connections throughout Europe correctly, we can enssure that our dynastic politics help cushion any blow dealt to us in the future."
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau: "Reformation Fervor in Nassau"
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has broken Europe up into several fragments with religion dividing them, alongside politics itself. Nassau itself must be ready to use this fervor to its advantage when it comes to defending itself via military force, and who knows, perhaps we can snag ourselves some cheaper mercenaries along the way due to the chaos and destruction occuring."
 dynastic_branches: "Dynastic Branching Paths"
 dynastic_branches_desc: "As our dynasty spreads into other realms and courts, it will undoubtedly start to become fragmented at points, taking on slightly different characteristics as time goes on. We will remind them readily, however, that they come from Nassau and that their ancestral land still has legitimacy over them."
 choosing_an_ambition: "Choosing an Ambition"
 choosing_an_ambition_desc: "The path for Nassau is unclear now. We are at a crossroads of sorts, and ahead of us lies uncertain times, but we are ready to face them with a strong foundation beneath us. Our ambition may not be clear yet, but we will forge it as we go forth."

 janibek_and_kerei_khan_desc: "The two instrumental figures that spearheaded our move for independence from the Uzbek Khanate are still highly revered amongst the Kazakh people today. Our military also looks to them for inspiration at times, using the shock tactics they once used in order to train more effectively and fight with greater efficency."
 struggling_for_steppe_control: "Steppe Control"
 struggling_for_steppe_control_desc: "Wresting control of the steppe is never an easy task, not since the great Mongol Empire fell some time ago. Though we are not the best candidate to take hold of the chaotic region that we call home, we can refine ourselves and prove our worth in this effort."
 fall_of_the_golden_horde: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 fall_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With the fall of the Golden Horde to the west, power in Central Asia is scattered and people are looking for strong leadership wherever it presents itself. The Kazakh people and its leaders are just such a source, and if cultivate our power just right, the people of Central Asia and maybe even beyond will dutifully obey us."
 rivals_to_our_east: "Rivals to our East"
 rivals_to_our_east_desc: "The east was home to the Chagatai and the Great Yuan, but now there merely hollow remnants in their place. Still, these remnants hold vestiges of power from their predecessors and are still our rivals, meaning we must take proper action against them and bring their banners under our own, uniting their people with the Kazakh people."
 cultures_of_the_steppe: "Cultures of the Steppe"
 cultures_of_the_steppe_desc: "The vast realm that is the steppe is home to a myriad of different languages and cultures, many of which see each other as rivals and enemies. If we can unify them under one banner and proclaim a common mission between them all, we can possible unite them and bolster our manpower reserves as well as our cultural unity."
 expanding_our_internal_domain: "Expanding Our Domain"
 expanding_our_internal_domain_desc: "Within the lands of the Kazakh, there are those who obey the leaders with little question, and those who hear very little from the leaders at all. Let us bring those who are far from the central authority of the Kazakh people closer in so that they too may listen to what the leaders in our administration say and put forth into law."
 modernize_our_tactics: "Modernize our Tactics"
 modernize_our_tactics_desc: "Time and time again, we are seeing the tactics of old run into issues against the modern weapons used predominantly by Europeans and those they trade with. Perhaps investing time and effort into modernization efforts for our military could yield positive results; our old tactics may be kept in books and documents for future use, but if the Kazakh military is to keep itself afloat, there must be some effort to reform and the military itself."

 utilize_corsairs: "Utilize Corsairs"
 utilize_corsairs_desc: "The tradition of pirating and using corsairs for shady interests is well known throughout Algiers and our navy is especially adept at it. If we invest in improvements into training and the materials and weapons used by our corsairs, maybe we can see a boost in profits? Or maybe we can see more ships come into our fold when they engage in battles on the high seas; enemy ships are always useful, whether its for scrap material or for use in our own fleet."
 import_gunpowder_weaponry: "Import Gunpowder Weaponry"
 import_gunpowder_weaponry_desc: "We are often used to the traditional methods of doing warfare in North Africa: blades, spears, bows-and-arrows, crossbows, and armor of some kind. This, however, is slowly becoming outdated as more and more we are seeing 'firearms' show up on the field of battle and being used by both infantry and cavalry. Algiers is nothing if not adaptable and will take to integrating these new weapons into the military so that they are not chained to the combat tactics of old."
 desert_tactics: "Desert Tactics"
 desert_tactics_desc: "The unforgiving terrain of North Africa is where Algerian people call home, and with its natural harshness comes a rather inexpensive defensive measure. Fortifications are nice and good, and we will build some, but the desert is its own fortification, hand-crafted by nature itself for thousands of years."
 champion_naval_combat: "Champions of Naval Combat"
 champion_naval_combat_desc: "Trial by combat at sea is what Algerian sailors must endure, and each of our sailors that has passed the trial has proven to be a true champion out on the water. Whether they are raiding coasts, fending off enemy fleets, or doing 'private' contracts along certain trade routes, the Algerians know that they can and will be the champions of naval combat."
 algiers_city_of_refuge: "A City of Refuge"
 algiers_city_of_refuge_desc: "Algiers doesn't practice a very staunch version of Islam, normally,a nd the city of Algiers itself, a blossoming flower in the harshness of North Africa, is by no means a place of persecution for those seeking safety from other places. We will take these persecuted poeple in and promote Algiers itself, along with its other connected cities around the region, as a place of refuge and renewed prosperity."
 algerian_waters: "Algerian Waters"
 algerian_waters_desc: "The coasts of North Africa are divided, and the islands of the Mediterranean are home to various divisions of people who pay fealty to meanial lords and rulers.

 islam_and_berber_society_desc: "Berbers have long lived on their before the Arabs arrived and began spreading Islam. Though the time has long passed since Islam was introduced and accepted into our societies, there are still tensions abound with Islam's various interpretations and teachings. It would serve us well if we were to mediate these differences peacefully and in a righteous manner, rather than hastily choosing one side and promoting violence against another side."
 nomadic_roots: "Nomadic Roots"
 nomadic_roots_desc: "Berbers have long since been nomadic, roaming the vast deserts and arid parts of North Africa for generations and only some times gathering into settlements. Though we're much different now and we have legitimate cities and towns, our nomadic heritage never has truly gone away and it still helps us move our people faster and with more efficiency whilst also extending our reach with trade routes."
 endless_mercenary_ties: "Endless Mercenary Ties"
 endless_mercenary_ties_desc: "Vast is the pool of mercenaries that the Berber people can employ. Various tribes all around the region of North Africa are willing to be hired as mercenaries and this is well known to all Berber leaders, meaning that the nigh endless supply of them can make for cheaper frontline personnel."

 harness_the_desert_desc: "Few can match our adapability when it comes to living amongst the sands of the desert and the arid terrain of North Africa. We can make use out of it better than most anyone else can, and if we continue to do so, none will be able to strike a deadly blow against us."

 the_many_berber_dynasties_desc: "Berbers have long since held positions of power since the time of the Umayyad Caliphate and its aftermath. Strong Berber dynasties dotted the landscape of both North Africa and the overall timeline of Islamic North Africa for centuries and that has not changed in the slightest; we merely see some rise, and some fall, and the cycle continues on without end, seemingly. Let us take our place in the light and show the others around us that we too are part of these grand dynasties of our people!"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith: "Making Amends with our Family in Faith"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith_desc: "Though we may be mostly united in faith, there are parts of our society that are undoubtedly in a state of 'heresy' to a degree and they are resistant to any form of conversion. The solution for them is to not kill them outright and to cause widespread unrest for unjust murders, but, rather to attempt to cooperate with them and see to it that they are understood and reconciled with. Social cohesion is something Berber states need as times change, and a Berber family united in faith, to some degree, is better than a Berber family fighting itself over such matters."

 uniting_the_maghreb_desc: "What is the goal of all Berbers who rule a state in North Africa? To see a unified power that can tame and unite the divided region into one single nation.

Deriving our name from the 'Arverni' tribe that fiercly resisted the Romans under the leader Vercingetorix, Aurvergne today still remembers much of its history and keeps it close, whether it is in the field of battle or in the streets of every day society."
 developments_of_auvergne: "Developments in Auvergne"
 developments_of_auvergne_desc: "The 10th through 13th century were some of the best times for the Auvergnese people. Churches and abbeys and other structures were done during this time period, leading to a fairly propserous and autonomous area that was loved by its own people. It is high time we continue these developments and introduce new and updated infrastructure so that Auvergne may rise in stature once more."
 safe_from_conflicts: "Safe from Conflicts"
 safe_from_conflicts_desc: "Thanks to our positio in the region, we have been relatively safe from conflicts such as the Hundred Years' War and various plauges from around Europe. Such safety is valued by both peasants and nobles alike, leading to increased social cohesion and in the end, higher profit margins in the area of producing resources."
 take_back_our_autonomy: "Take back our Autonomy"
 take_back_our_autonomy_desc: "It was King Philip II of France who, in the late 12th to early 13th century, ended our autonomy in the French region. Though peasants may not have cared, the administrative body and the nobles surely did not like this and to this day, there are those who still desire autonomy once more. Perhaps it is time we take it back and ready ourselves for when there is resistance to our demands."

 promote_french_culture_desc: "Though distinct as we are in the French region as we speak 'Auvergnat', a variant of the Occitan language from further south, French culture (with a tinge of Auvergnese flavor added in) is still dominant in our land. The promotion of it in our court and slowly promoting it around us through our friends and allies will ensure that we are never short of friendly neighbors in the future."
 technological_interests: "Technological Interests"
 technological_interests_desc: "Focusing on the present is one thing, but looking to the far flung future and what it holds is something few around us rarely do. Auvergne has always and will continue to hold itself to this higher standard, looking toward the future and seeking new technologies and insights where others do not, or cannot."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 siegneur_de_bourbon: "Siegneur de Bourbon"
 siegneur_de_bourbon_desc: "Though it is a bit of an outdated title, the Seigneur of Bourbon was what our rulers would be called from the period of 913 - 1327. Reclaiming the title, however, will undoubtedly give us and our people a sense of distinguished identity in the French region; after we reclaim it, keeping ourselves in good standing with the people will ensure that we are viewed as the legitimate rulers of Bourbonnais."
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon: "First House of Bourbon"
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon_desc: "The first run of power we had was under the first House of Bourbon, which was more or less founded by Aymon I. Charles the Simple gave him the land that are considered today 'Bourbonnais' and it is through his legacy from the first House of Bourbon that we help reinforce our authority over the land."
 ties_to_burgundy: "Ties to Burgundy"
 ties_to_burgundy_desc: "After the death of the last dynastic member of the second House of Bourbon, Archambaut IX, who died in Cyprus whilst crusading in 1249, was the one who left our land in a state of question and uncertainty. The House of Burgundy took charge afterwards and subsequently acquired the land of Bourbonnais afterwards, thus giving us external ties to what became a rival of France itself. Perhaps we can use these outside ties again in the future? It'd surely be to our benefit if we could, and did."
 defending_our_claims: "Defending our Claims"
 defending_our_claims_desc: "Our claims on the land around us, especially in the French region, are legitimate and firmly within our rights to take and annex into the lands of Bourbonnais. If those around us or around the land in question wish to challenge the authority of Bourbonnais on these claims, we will defend them vigorously with our finest noble officers riding forth gloriously against the enemy."
 royalty_in_france_proper: "Royalty in France"
 royalty_in_france_proper_desc: "The 'House of Bourbon' is still quite the renowned name in French lands; even the name 'Bourbon' is still spoken in high regard or with the knowledge that there is considerable prestige and behind the name itself. Now is the time to start building off this prestige and grandeur given to us by the people of France, and we will begin with a reformation and bolstering of the Bourbonnean soldiers."
 grace_from_charles_iv: "Grace from Charles IV"
 grace_from_charles_iv_desc: "Charles IV, last dynastic member of the House of Capet, was the one who greatly aided Bourbonnais in the early 14th century. Under him, the alliance between the Bourbons and royalty of France itself prospered and subsequently Bourbonnais was elevated to the status of 'duchy', granting us more legitimacy and prestige throughout France. If we can capitalize on this old granting of power and ride our prestige and legitimacy into the new ages ahead, Bourbonnais will become a power that none will be able to match."

 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy_desc: "The memory lives on from when Avignon was the seat of power in the Catholic Church. The curia itself was moved to Avignon on March 9t, 1309 and until 1403, it remained a prime contestant for Papal power as the Papal Schism went on. Too many are forgetting when we were triumphant and powerful... Soon they will remember what made our city grand, and the people of Avignon, revered."
 avignon_exchange: "The Avignon Exchange"
 avignon_exchange_desc: "As one of the first sites of a foreign exchange market, we take pride in retaining this title and the luxuries that came with the the Avignon Exchange. Not only did it promomt trade, but money lenders also found themselves at home here and with them on our side, securing beneficial loans and monetary advances will be all the more easier for us."

 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes_desc: "Though not in use by the Papacy anymore, the palace and fortress her still serve important purposes for Avignon as a whole. Displaying our opulence and wealth and willingness to defend our land, renovating the Palais des Papes and keeping it in working order will undoubtedly help us learn how to fortifiy and keep our other lands outside of Avignon safe."
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon: "Advances of Avignon"
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon_desc: "The papal library and University of Avignon are some of the greatest works we have still after the fall of the last Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII. Retaining the knowledge that both produced and keeping them functioning for the city and the administration is of the utmost importance to us and Avignonese society as whole."
 build_upon_previous_developments: "Building upon our Developments"
 build_upon_previous_developments_desc: "The previous developments within Avignon, whether they be in terms of infrastructure to help bolster our society or administrative measures to assert our authority, must be constantly compounded upon for better and more lasting results. We must work things harder, make things better, do things faster, so that we, of Avignon, are stronger."

 revenge_for_the_papal_schism_desc: "The great Papal Schism that once empowered Avignon as a place of grandeur and wonder may be over now, but the scar it left on us is not forgotten.

 ancient_contention_desc: "The region of Normandy has been a place rife with tension since it is valuable to those of the Isles to the north and to those just to our south. Though the tensions have often caused the Norman people much in the way of strife, it has also made us ready for whatever comes our way next."
 chateau_de_rouen: "Chateau de Rouen" 
 chateau_de_rouen_desc:"The Chateau de Rouen may be a symbol of French authority, but we can turn it from being such a thing. If we centralize our power enough amongst the Norman administration and ensure that the chateau itself is safe and maintained, it will become a symbol of Norman authority rather than just French authority."
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter: "The Norman Charter"
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter_desc: "The Norman Charter of 1315 was the one piece of legislation that kept Normandy afloat and at least somewhat independent of royal authority, especially during that time period since authority from the French in Paris was faltering. We will take to the Norman Charter and refine it over time, building upon what administrative qualities it instituted into Normandy itself."
 empower_norman_administrators: "Empower Norman Administrators"
 empower_norman_administrators_desc: "Keeping in line with our independent nature, we will be using more Norman administrators in our government than French ones. Those of Paris and the central part of the French region can keep to their houses and manors, the Norman people will be the ones put in charge as only they can judge and rule Normandy correctly. Once they are set in Normandy though, perhaps they can help our other lands become more centralized too? We can only hope and try."
 channel_ambitions: "Channel Ambitions"
 channel_ambitions_desc: "The Channel is one the key body of water we need to be concerned with as it holds access to the lands of the Isles and our own coasts. Trade goes into and out of the Channel and it would do us good to make sure that these routes of trade are secure for the Norman people, as opposed to others around us."
 norman_revival: "Norman Revival"
 norman_revival_desc: "Gone will the days be of the French and English attempting to subjugate us in their own names; there will be a true Norman state, for the Norman people, and it will be glorious as it goes on through history!

 cohesion_in_the_deccan_desc: "Our position in the region known as the Deccan is tenuous and subject to influence from seveal different shahs and rajas around us. The people of Berar must know unity and peace with each other if they are to ever see the light of tomorrow in a solemn peace the resonates throughout the entirety of the land."
 setup_forges_and_foundries: "Setup Forges and Foundries"
 setup_forges_and_foundries_desc: "Incoming foreigners occasionally bring with them strange weapons they call 'firearms' that use and explosive powder called 'gunpowder'. Though some are reluctant to use such weapons, our engineers and military officers are keen on seeing how they perform in combat against our enemies; some of the wealthy individuals from our military are even willing ot put up the money to start producing such weapons inside Berar. Since it is isn't our money going into these facilities, why stop them from being built?"
 modernizing_weaponry: "Modernizing our Weapons"
 modernizing_weaponry_desc: "The age of warfare is changing all throughout India and beyond. Slowly but surely the enemies around Berar are gaining these weapons too, thus making the battlefield equal once more. We don't need this, we need to make it favored to us once again throughout investments into new military technology and refinements in our current military weapons."
 fortification_artillery: "Fortification Artillery"
 fortification_artillery_desc: "Fortifications around Berar are fine on their own, but they lack the punch to retaliate against our enemies when they come under siege. If we begin to use artillery from defensive positions from our fortifications against besieging armies, perhaps we can also use this knowledge later on when we other armies in battle? Field artillery is something of great interest to our military officers and perhaps investing in the concept now will pay off later for Berar."
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar: "Reforming the Berari Succession"
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar_desc: "We must not focus purely on one aspect of Berar and neglecy others, especially when we can see the crumbling of various dynasties around us from time to time. We must take to reforming the succession laws of Berar and instituting more refined and strict rules regarding which heir is eligble for the throne so that in the future we can avoid succession struggles."
 meritocratic_military_organization: "Merit over Blood"
 meritocratic_military_organization_desc: "The time has come for us to phase out the aging method of nobles leading our armies into battle. Too many times has Berar seen its good men cut down by a leader who was supposed to be bright and capable because he was born of a grand family tree, no, this must change for the Berari military. There will be military academies set up and there will be skill-based recruitment of commanders; the nobles deserve less than we give them."
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression: "Sustain Ourselves from Aggression"
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression_desc: "The rivals around us show no signs of resting, and neither do we. For decades now, the Berari people have focused on outward expansion and neglected to think of their own safety and their own walls that should keep them safe. Perhaps it is time for a slight shift, for, defensive measures are also in the interests of Berar, just as offensive measures are."

 GOC_ideas_bonus: "Golconda Ambition"
 persian_origins: "Persian Origins"
 persian_origins_desc: "Our nobles and rulers can trace their origins to the region of Persia itself, bringing with them a plethora of knowledge and ideas from outside India. Spreading these ideas and fusing them with Indian ideas on various matters can lead to a rich cultural exchange that Golconda would be foolish to not look into and take advantage of."
 patronize_learning_and_buildings: "Patronize Learning and Buildings"
 patronize_learning_and_buildings_desc: "Though our origins lay far away, we have come to adopt the language and customs of the Telugu and surrounding people groups. Combining our knowledge from Persia with the likes of Indian and Muslim engineers to construct elaborate structures that are both prestigious and functional will allow Golconda to flourish in the future in the fields of innovation and grandeur."
 golconda_diamonds: "Golconda Diamonds"
 golconda_diamonds_desc: "The rich diamond mine within our territory provides wealth beyond belief, as some would say. Though we carefully cultivate the production of diamonds and gems in our land, we should not be so strict that we inadvertently hinder our income. Reworking and refining our production methods over time will likely ensure that profit margins are firmly in favor of Golconda."
 golconda_fort: "Golconda Fort"
 golconda_fort_desc: "The fortress within our capital is not something that should be taken lightly. It is our duty to keep it taken care of and manned whenever necessary so as to keep our capital safe from invaders, but also to help be an example of how to build future fortifications in different areas we come to control."
 adopt_deccani_culture: "Adopting Deccani Culture"
 adopt_deccani_culture_desc: "The myriad of peopel groups in the Deccan are briming with opportunity, but also tension, and the administrators of Golconda can see this quite clearly. There must be sustained efforts by our administration to adopt and integrate these different groups of people in the Deccan into Golconda as a whole, thus making Golconda more unified as a whole."
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire: "Against the Vijayanagara Empire"
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire_desc: "To our south is the mighty and fearsome Vijayanagara Empire. Though powerful in many ways, we of Golconda are powerful as well and not willing to let the wrath of the Vijayanagara Empire wash over our land without a fight. To the very last man, Golconda will fight! The Sultanate of Bahmanis may not have been able to do this, but we succeed where they failed at and hold off the threats from the south!"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate: "Centralize the Sultanate"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate_desc: "As time moves forward, so to do our people. It won't be long before new technologies present new challenges to our authority, which is why we will need more active efforts to centralize power throughout the land into an orderly form. It won't be easy, but it will be worth the effort in the end."

 sufis_of_bijapur_desc: "The gracious sufis of our land have been here since a couple centuries ago, helping form communities become more in line with Islam itself and also promoting the connections between Hindu and Muslim communities spread throughout. Despite harsh treatment early on in their arrival, the sufis have since increased in number and have brought a sense of wider community to Bijapur as a whole."
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture: "Commerical and Cultural Hub"
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture_desc: "Our capital is something of a gem in the central part of India. Being a place of great commerce and culture, our leaders know how to cultivate a thriving hub of merchants and civilians alike as they come from different backgrounds and different regions. Let us continue this great trend and build up our capital to be an economic and cultural heart in India, greater than the cities in the north like Delhi and Lahore!"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan: "The Palmyra of the Deccan"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan_desc: "Bijapur, due to our efforts in making sure it is a place for culture and commerce and a place where people from all over India can come and feel as though they are at home, is being nicknamed the 'Palmyra of the Deccan'. The namy 'Palmyra' may be a bit lost on us, but it brings with it apparent prestige and good tidings, so we will gladly adopt it."
 southward_ambitions: "Southward Ambitions"
 southward_ambitions_desc: "The south is where our most fearsome competition lies, rather than the north. The Hindu leaders that oppose our might and who would see Bijapur fall into disrepair will know our might and the superiority of our troops; our ambitions will be satiated once we secure the southern realms, and after that, perhaps even other areas."
 new_age_of_indian_warfare: "New Age of Indian Warfare"
 new_age_of_indian_warfare_desc: "Gunpowder is continuously making its way into the field of battle at every turn. From two-handed weapons to full on cannons that can breach the walls of stone fortresses, the soldiers of Bijapur are going to need to adapt to this new age of warfare and be the first to use it effectively in India."
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals: "Develop Water Systems and Hospitals"
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals_desc: "The water systems of India are often lacking in how clean they are and how refined they could be, as are the hospitals and medical areas around the region. Bijapur has scholars from around its land who are ready to help innovate on both of these fronts if we take them up on their offers, letting the people of Bijapur know both increased health and an increased quality of life."
 institute_educational_systems: "Institute Educational Systems"
 institute_educational_systems_desc: "One common controversey that keeps coming up amongst the population of Bijapur is education. More classical ways of education may have been fine in the past for our ancestors, but in a time of increasingly diversifying ways of thought, especially on how education should be conducted and instituted in Bijapuri land, we must be open to new ways of thinking and reforming what we have in place. Bijapur must not be stuck in the past."

 organizing_the_court_of_ahmednagar: "Organizing the Court of Ahmednagar"
 organizing_the_court_of_ahmednagar_desc: "The court of ours is chaotic to say the least. Several intermarriages and cross level relationships in our administration have made things tangled and hard to undo, but Ahmednagar is not without options here. If we work to simplify the court structure and refine it to a more efficient style, we can reduce the possibility of corruption creeping into our court and nation as a whole."
 the_uncertain_north: "The Uncertain North"
 the_uncertain_north_desc: "The north is where many kingdoms have come and gone from, both Hindu and Muslim in nature. Our contacts in that direction are sparse as it is, necessitating us being prepared should any hostilities start coming against us from there."
 succession_in_the_deccan: "Succession in the Deccan"
 succession_in_the_deccan_desc: "In the Deccan, succession is hardly an easy thing to sort out. The Sultanate of Bahmanis is gone and many do not know where their allegiance lies, but we will be the ones to show them that the Deccan can be united once more. Propagating this message throughout upon our conquests will ensure more local cooperation throughout newly conquered lands."
 strengthen_and_centralize_the_military: "Military Centralization"
 strengthen_and_centralize_the_military_desc: "Though some around India and elsewhere value a more decentralized military complex in their nation, but Ahmednagar is not included. We will build a more centralized and grand military that is fit for an imperial power from the Deccan, one that can succeed where the sultans of Bahmanis left off."
 southern_threats: "Southern Threats"
 southern_threats_desc: "Not only is the north full of threats to Ahmednagar, but the south is as well. They fight differently than those of the north do, however, and use more shock-based tactics that will require us to outthink and outsmart them. Utilizing new weapons that have proven effective against war elephants and other troops typically fielded by southern powers will help us fight them."
 the_need_for_stability: "The Need for Stability"
 the_need_for_stability_desc: "Throughout India, especially in the Deccan, several languages and cultures are found that are unique in their traditions and customs. It would be foolish of Ahmednagari administrators to think that they could sort out these cultures through typical means; no, there must be integration and acceptance of the various people groups into Ahmednagar if there is to be stability from the ground up."

 lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc: "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government.

 reformation_of_military_ranks_desc: "Cleaning up the mess that is the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, and the military ranks of Qi are something that will be needed in order to help clean up said mess.

 support_from_scholars_and_officials_desc: "The support of scholars and those accomplished officials that are scattered throughout the Middle Kingdom are key to achieving what Great Shun needs: legitimacy and satiation of the population.

 fight_for_authority: "Fight for Authority"
 fight_for_authority_desc: "The Middle Kingdom is rarely ever a cohesive and stable entity as threats from the outside constantly knock at the doors from the outside and dangers internally are consistently threatening the stability of the holder of the Mandate of Heaven. Great Shun may be seen as yet another to be fated to this same dangerous fate, but we will ensure that we take measures to secure our successes when we obtain them, but before then, we we will need to make sure that our fight to get there is in firmly within our hands; that is, the hands of the ones who are obedient to heaven itself."

 from_the_crusades_desc: "Part of our origins lays within the 11th century when people of the House of Foix took part in the First Crusade in 1095. Though much time has passed since the time of the First Crusade, the spirit of this time period still runs true in Foix and its military, leading it to heightened potential as compared to others in the French region."
 against_the_mountain_walls: "Against the Mountain Walls"
 against_the_mountain_walls_desc: "The southern part of our initial domain is defensive in nature due to being the place of the might Pyrenees. With them as a key defensive tool, we will be able to focus defensive efforts from one less key direction and more so in the directions of where potential attacks might come from, such as from our rivals in the French region itself in the north."
 maintain_outside_connections: "Maintain Outside Connections"
 maintain_outside_connections_desc: "Iberia lay not far from the territory Foix, and in the past it has been a possible avenue of relations should our relationship with the nobles of France worsen. If we are to maintain Foix as it is and eventually expand it outwards, we will need to secure outside alliances, marriages, and deals that others may not be able to."
 tenuous_stance_by_french_royalty: "Tenuous Stance"
 tenuous_stance_by_french_royalty_desc: "The French nobility have never been truly fond of the Foixien people and their local rulers, which is why we are only emboldened when they come knocking at our doors for undue fealty. Drive them away and show them that the swords and muskets of Foix stand ready to stand against those who demand respect rather than earn it!"
 fortify_the_castle_of_foix: "Fortify the Castle of Foix"
 fortify_the_castle_of_foix_desc: "It would do us good to renovate and keep up with the maintenance of the castle of Foix since it can be, in time, used as an example for other fortresses in our land. If we have a set plan for how they should be built and maintained, we can cheapen the cost of keeping them in service and in conjunction keep Foix even safer."
 ambitions_from_the_border: "Ambitions from the Border"
 ambitions_from_the_border_desc: "The border region between the French people and the Iberian people is something of a hot spot for tension, but that does not dampen our ambitions in the slightest. The border region has made our people stronger and better than the others around us, who is to say that the border region can't produce a power capable of conquering other lands?"
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 grand_aristocracy_desc: "The upper echelon of Champagnian society, the noble class and the glorius cadre that give Champagne its grandeur and distinct style, they will need to be handled with care and dignity if they are to benefit the administration in all avenues. It won't be an easy task managing them, but who else other than us can do this task?"
 close_ties_to_the_royalty: "Close Ties to the Royalty"
 close_ties_to_the_royalty_desc: "The nobility of Champagne benefit not only us internally, but also externally when they intermingle with other branches of other states. This has happened frequenetly with the royalty of France itself, meaning that our legitimacy in all of the French region is a cut above the rest."
 inheritor_of_france: "Inheritor of France"
 inheritor_of_france_desc: "Our proximity and our close ties with the French royalty have garnered us a prestigious title that, though informal, is recognized by many throughout our realm and those beyond it: The Inheritor of France. We will use force to enforce this title and those around the French region will bow to the leaders of Champagne."
 champagne_fairs: "Champagne Fairs"
 champagne_fairs_desc: "To continue the tradition of our ancestors and to continue the spread of Champagnian influence and grandeur, Champagne Fairs will continue to be held throughout our lands whether in small doses or on grand scales. Though mercantile matters may change how they are done and performed, the mere fact that they still occur will increase the wealth and influence of Champagne itself."
 the_eastern_border: "The Eastern Border"
 the_eastern_border_desc: "To our east are the Germanic peoples of the Holy Roman Empire. Though divided and arguing constantly, they pose a serious threat to the French people, most importantly those of Champagne. There will need to be stiff measures brought to the forefront of things if we are to keep ourselves from being overrun or outplayed by the Germans, such as widening our military potential as a whole."
 the_diplomatic_game: "The Diplomatic Game"
 the_diplomatic_game_desc: "Diplomacy is the art of working through words and papers to get done what could be done with the bloodshed and conflict. To say that Champagne is an expert in this field is an understatement, and it will show as we make our way through the chaotic place that is Europe itself."

 feudal_and_hre_roots: "Feudal and Holy Roman Empire Roots"
 feudal_and_hre_roots_desc: "From the Middle Ages all across Europe, several small states rose up and claimed localized power. Those of Dauphine were part of this rise in localized power and were at first an Imperial Fief of the Holy Roman Empire, but soon were under French rulership. Such connections in both Francien and German realms gives Dauphine a unique lineage to draw upon, one that shall not be put to waste anytime soon."
 the_savoy_daphine_conflicts: "The Savoy-Dauphine Conflicts"
 the_savoy_daphine_conflicts_desc: "In the 12th century, early in the history of Dauphine itself, the borders were much less firm and much more subject to change. As a result, when titles were changed and cities shifted hands, power struggles emerged over miscommunication and various disputes, the prime example we have being the disputes between Savoy and Dauphine over cities like Voiron and la Cota-Saint-Andre and the Faucigny. Such conflicts do not fade into history so easily and we retain the potential to claim land that our ancestors once had."
 french_military_service: "French Military Service"
 french_military_service_desc: "Dauphinois nobles have in the past served well in the French military, standing out at certain battles and often being recognized for their hard work for the royal domain. Perhaps we should have these noble soldiers of our realm bring those battle plans and strategies back home with them so that the wider military of Dauphine can learn from them."
 sort_out_the_noble_feuds: "Sort out the Noble Feuds"
 sort_out_the_noble_feuds_desc: "Nobles fueding with each other is one of the utmost problems that we can face as a state and nation. Quarrels between them can last years and drain several resources from Dauphine itself, which we absolutely do not want or need. We must take action now and ensure that we cut noble families off from vital domains and resources within Dauphine so that we can prevent any major collapse from even having a chance at starting."
 remembering_humber_ii: "Humbert II of Viennois"
 remembering_humber_ii_desc: "The proud Dauphin that was Humbert II of Viennois created the Conseil Delphinal and the University of Grenoble, along with enacting the Delphinal Status that helped protect the rights of the Dauphinois people. It is his work that helped set the foundation for what we of Dauphine have today, and what we continue to build off of, for the good of the people and the good of the state itself."

 patronize_the_universities_desc: "Advancing the technological sector of Dauphine by funding the widespread education of the Dauphinois people should be of the highest priority since they are the foundation of our future as a state, and as an upstart nation. With a solid foundation to build off of, Dauphine will know greater heights than any other French nation, and perhaps even see the unifcation of the French people before any others."

 the_question_of_ming_succession_desc: "The Ming Dynasty is but a fleeting dream in the minds of several groups of people in both peasant and noble circles. Those of Ning are some of the most keen on seeing this declining dynasty that does not deserve the Mandate of Heavean turned into paper and ink on the shelves of history, and we are only all too happy to proclaim that the question of who will succeed the Ming Dynasty, will be those of Ning."
 zhu_chenhao: "Zhu Chenhao"
 zhu_chenhao_desc: "Zhu Chenhao is the one who began sentiments about the waning Ming Dynasty's authority and lack of proper succession for the throne, and he was the one who attempted to seize it for himself. Though he might have failed, his legacy lives on in us, those of Ning that still rule from the area in and around Nanchang and who are still keen on seeing those of proper Chinese culture thrive and prosper."
 coercion_leads_to_deals: "Coercion and Deals"
 coercion_leads_to_deals_desc: "Part of how Zhu Chenhao got his start in garnering support for his cause was through bribery and backroom deals with various officials in and around the Chinese courts. Though some find these tactics distasteful, we find them to be part of the overall grand strategy that is needed in order to claim what power rightfully belongs to Ning."
 claiming_or_making_the_throne: "Claiming or Making the Throne"
 claiming_or_making_the_throne_desc: "The throne of the Ming Dynasty is seen by many to be riddled with flaws and corruption, lacking in what it takes to truly be something that can hold the Mandate of Heaven. The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."
 core_at_nanchang: "Core at Nanchang"
 core_at_nanchang_desc: "Nanchang is not only fertile ground for agriculture and commerce, but it is also ready for infrastructure developments that we, the administrators of Ning, are ready to fund. Those of the Ming Dynasty are too busy with corrupt ways and other areas to deal with Nanchang, but we are more than willing to heed the needs of its people and soon enough, the other people we will grow to encompass."
 widespread_support: "Widespread Support"
 widespread_support_desc: "The support for Ning is becoming more and more prevalent. Those of Nanchang that were once staunch activists against us are becoming sympathetic to our cause, and those who rallied to our cause at first are spreading the fervor elsewhere. There are more than enough people willing to take up arms against the Ming Dynasty, we simply need to find work for them within our domain."

The Tang Dynasty is still remembered fondly around us and we are seeing rising support in at least local areas for our resurgence. This wave of support, we must cultivate it in both society and out military so that we can ensure a strong and stable foundation that is capable of holding up our grand revival."
 centuries_of_warfare: "Centuries of Warfare"
 centuries_of_warfare_desc: "Military conquest was nothing new to us when we held the Mandate of Heaven and it evolved during our time in the spotlight. In the time since we've been away, however, innovations have been had that we must incorporate actively into our own military if we are to become a true military force once more. Warfare changes, and with it, so must be, adapting with and improving upon what new technologies come about for our soldiers."

 cultivate_the_3_departments_6_ministries_desc: "The system enstated by the Sui Dynasty that comprised of three departments underneath the emperor, and six ministries underneath the central Department of State Affairs.

 claiming_tribute_and_subjects_desc: "Various states outside the actual borders of the Tang Dynasty were often tributaries and subjects of us. It was and still is considered a great honor and a show of power to have such subjects and we are only all too willing to once again flaunt our power in this way. Who knows, perhaps the old rulers of these far off places we once influenced remember our englightened way of thinking and rulership?"

 dominating_trade_sectors_desc: "We were the preeminent holders of the eastern and central parts of the Silk Road when we holders of the Mandate of Heaven. Trade regions within our domain and just outside of it were affected by our trade policies and how we regulated the goods going along it. Though new trade routes have opened in this new age of opportunity, we are still more than able to adapt and put our trade knowledge to use, taking what revenue is rightfully ours."

 reclaim_the_lost_glory_desc: "The age of our ancestors is long gone, only to be remembered from the brush strokes painted onto paper and from the sayings of our fathers and mothers. In these turbulent times, politics have shifted and a new age is upon the people of the Tang Dynasty, an age that will see them reclaim what they lost so long ago. No longer will they stand by and watch pretender after pretender seize the throne of the Middle Kingdom, corrupting it further with each new ruler; we will restore the balance of power, and reclaim what glory we lost so long ago."

 an_lushan_rebellion_desc: "Due to the decadent Tang Dynasty, instability grew throughout the entirety of the land. Thanks in part to An Lushan's great connections and influence within the Tang Dynasty, his proclamation of rebellion and the eventualy Great Yan Dynasty were heard throughout the land of the Middle Kingdom, gathering several people from all walks of life to the cause."
 merchant_class_insurgents: "Merchant Class Insurgents"
 merchant_class_insurgents_desc: "Part of the rebellion was started by merchants disguised to infiltrate various echelons of society and infrastructure to gather support. Though not unheard of, we would be wise to continue using merchants in our underhanded measures since it continues to work for us."
 prosperous_northern_roots: "Prosperous Northern Roots"
 prosperous_northern_roots_desc: "We hail from the northern parts of the Middle Kingdom, renowned for its fertility in agriculture and prosperity as a hot spot for urban growth. By cultivating the image and the memory of the Great Yan Dynasty in the hearts and minds of the northern people, we can obtain a steady stream of recruits willing to fight for us, and with this in mine, perhaps we can soon spread our message into other parts fo the Middle Kingdom."
 revise_succession_laws: "Revise Succession Laws"
 revise_succession_laws_desc: "One of the key factors that undercut An Lushan and his rebellion after he proclaimed the Great Yan Dynasty was the matter of succession, for his son did end up killing him in the end, causing a major succession struggle to ensue. What we need is a reformation of succession laws and how our heirs rank in comparison to each other so that we do not suffer what An Lushan did."
 soldiers_from_many_regions: "Soldiers from many Regions"
 soldiers_from_many_regions_desc: "Part of the nature of An Lushan's rebellion was that it was multi-ethnic. People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."

 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

His actions may have brought about the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but there was merit and there were reasons as to why he did so and we live on in the hopes that we can see his ambitions through to the end."
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan: "Ambition for Luoyang and Chang'an"
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan_desc: "The twin capitals of the Tang Dynasty were Luoyang and Chang'an. By exerting influence and eventual direct control over both historic centers of administration and power, those of the Liang Dynasty may rise to become even more powerful and prepared for more ambitious conquests in the Middle Kingdom."

 from_kaifeng_outwards_desc: "The foundational power for the Later Liang was at Kaifeng and Emperor Taizu and his son, Emperor Mo, attempted to cultivate it to become a place where the Later Liang could exert power from. If we put enough time and effort into making Kaifeng into just such a place where the Liang Dynasty is known as the true and legitimate holder of the Mandate of Heaven, then we will be well on our way to claiming the whole of the Middle Kingdom for ourselves."

 memories_of_the_southern_tang_desc: "Inept military measures and internal struggles became our downfall under Emperor Mo as the Southern Tang conquered our territory in its bid to reform the Tang Dynasty once more. It is through this horrible defeat that we will learn from and implement sweeping military reforms that are aimed at targeting how inept we once more, and ensuring that the Liang Dynasty will be able to hold out against those who seek to destroy it."

 help_from_the_north_desc: "Shatuo Turks were of importance to the Later Liang due to the fact that Emperor Taizu had to maintain tense relations with them since he had a previous rivalry with Li Keyong, governor of Shanxi province. Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain. The rivalry is gone now, and the Shatuo Turks are but distant memories, yet still a bond of mutual benefits still lingers between the Liang Dynasty and the people from the north."

Many find it hard to live here like we have, and those who dare intrude on our land with hostile intent will be like those who have tried before: dying on the ground, crawling against the Zhuang people."
 tenuous_chinese_authority: "Tenuous Chinese Authority"
 tenuous_chinese_authority_desc: "We find ourselves far from any firm authority from the Middle Kingdom itself. Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth. With this in mind, we are often left to ourselves and governing our land in the ways we have cultivated over the centuries is much better when compared to top-down laws of force by the Chinese from afar."
 remember_the_nanzhao: "Remember the Kingdom of Nanzhao"
 remember_the_nanzhao_desc: "The Tai people and their great kingdom of Nanzhao was something to behold. The Zhuang people looked up to them as they repelled armies from the Chinese in 751 and 754, but we could not do the same, unfortunately. Still, their example of unity amidst the onslaught of Chinese forces glows brightly as an example for our people to follow."
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang: "Warrior Women of the Zhuang"
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang_desc: "Unlike other cultures around us, we, the Zhuang, see women as a resource almost as valuable as men in regards to fighting. We train many women in similar ways in which we train men in regards to military matters and as such they are able to earn a better place amongst the clans of the Zhuang people."
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes: "Ridding ourselves of Tribalism"
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes_desc: "Perhaps it is a reason as to why our people are so weak at promoting influence beyond Guangxi; tribes and clans from around the area we inhabit are always keen on gaining or usurping power from the others, but anytime this happens, great feuds erupt and atrocities are witnessed that should never happen. It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."

 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism_desc: "The traditional religious practices of the Zhuang people are strange when compared to the Buddhists to the south, or the Confucians in the rest of the Middle Kingdom. Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on. If we do this and actively work to help reform it into a state religion, the Zhuang people may seen unity on yet another level crucial for sustaining a prospering state."

 peace_for_the_zhuang_people_desc: "Though some of our people have lofty ambitions for a great empire spanning to the horizons in all directions, the majority of Zhuang people simply want peace in their lives, free from the authorities from the Middle Kingdom and free from dangers elsewhere.

 shang_yang_promoting_legalism_desc: "The type of legalism promoted by Shang Yang to the military and administration of the Qin Dynasty after the Zhou Dynasty fell from grace was the type that made the fighters of our state ruthless and efficient.

It is this legacy that we of the resurgent Qin Dynasty keep to."

 ready_for_military_reforms_desc: "Part of the strength of the Qin Dynasty was its capability of adopting military reforms and innovations for itself as this proved crucial in the Spring and Autumn Period that preceeded the formalization of the Qin Dynasty.

 strong_political_and_peasent_base_desc: "Legalism was foundational to our power, but it alone could not have propelled the Qin Dynasty to prominence.

Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."

We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end.

 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."

 resisting_central_chinese_authority: "Resisting Central Chinese Authority"
 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."

 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be. It is partially because of his example that we continue to try to be ready militarily for whatever comes our way, lest we fail and succumb to foreign incursions or internal decadance."
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters: "Keepers of the Southern Waters"
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally. We must protect these trade routes and water ways from those further north so that the prosperity comes solely to us, and once that is established, naval dominance is a mere small step away."
 connections_to_the_vietnamese: "Connections to the Viet People"
 connections_to_the_vietnamese_desc: "The Yue people are connected to the Viet people in at least some tangential fashion and this is evident through our history that dates back to the Nanyue Kingdom. By building relations with the Viet people and cultivating prosperous ties with key Viet officials, we can begin to bridge the gap betweent he two people groups and once again fight against the hegemony attempting to be imposed on from the north."
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together: "Blending of Administrations"
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom: "The Great Nanyue Kingdom"
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom_desc: "Though seemingly gone from the memory of many, the Nanyue Kingdom is still around in the hearts and minds of several Yue people. Our descent from it to today is miraculous and intriguing to say the least, but now that there is again an independent Yue state, there can finally be a proper and legitimate successor to the kingdom of old."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 maritime_investments: "Maritime Investments"
 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."
 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty: "Discard the Yin Dynasty"
 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty_desc: "One of the sons of Wang Shenzhi rebelled against him and proclaimed himself the 'Yin Dynasty', a bitter memory in which we are eager to stamp out entirely. It brought great disunity to the Min people; we simply can't let it happen again in any shape or form, for a united Min is what is needed, not a divided one."
 cultivate_the_min_domain: "Cultivate the Min Domain"
 cultivate_the_min_domain_desc: "Though not the easiest land to develop for productive or agricultural uses, the Min domain is capable of becoming prosperous if time and effort are put into it. Seeing as it is our heartland where most of our people live, why shouldn't we develop it?"
 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang: "Succeed where we Failed"
 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang_desc: "The Southern Tang took advantage of the disunity within the Min Kingdom and our allegiance to Wuyue was not able to hold off the onslaught of the Southern Tang. We must learn from the lessons in warfare they taught us and curate a better and more robust military, starting from the core of things: the infantry."
 out_of_isolation: "Out of Isolation"
 out_of_isolation_desc: "The trade routes through the coastal waters may seem to be a good way at getting us out of isolation, but in truth they only get us contacts, not formal relations. We must bring ourselves truly out of isolation from the southern reaches and into a new age of outreach and diplomacy if we hope to survive and thrive."

 marriage_and_purchase: "Marriage and Purchase"
 marriage_and_purchase_desc: "Through the expertise of our old counts, Armagnac increased in both size and power throughout the 13th and 14th century. Marriages were crucial in securing the land we now call home, and purchases of various plots of land from other nobles and families was also key to our fortune. As such, we have garnered a considerable amount of influence around us, and even more power within our own domain."
 no_to_the_black_prince: "Turn Away from the Black Prince"
 no_to_the_black_prince_desc: "When Edward the Black Prince was given control over our lands in 1360, he sought to use the Armagnac people to his advantage. Taxes beyond belief were levied from the people, but they said no and refused his harsh authority and instead appealed to the French royal court instead. It is this resistance to the English and favoring of those who understand us better, those of French descent, that we must keep alive."
 enemies_of_burgundy: "Enemies of Burgundy"
 enemies_of_burgundy_desc: "The feudal politics of the early 15th century resulted in hostile sentiment being stirred against Burgundy within Armagnac. Though we aren't as keen to be under direct royal authority from Paris, the Burgundians are even worse and as such, the people of Armagnac are slowly uniting against these foul people in order to rid them of Europe once and for all."
 armagnac_mercenaries: "Armagnac Mercenaries"
 armagnac_mercenaries_desc: "The Armagnacs, formed by Count Bernard VII, may be vicious and fearsome and often hard to lock down in formal contracts of service, but they know their origins in Armagnac itself. Though most were incorporated into the French military itself, there are still bands out there, ready to serve as grand mercenaries once more if we are willing to pay the price."
 sustain_armagnac_power: "Sustain Armagnac Power"
 sustain_armagnac_power_desc: "The usage of the Armagnacs previously has not only helped garner good tidings with them, but even military tactics and strategies are being shared with them too. Though some might think this is a bit far since they are still technically mercenaries, we know their loyalty lies within their homeland and will grant them services from our military itself."
 resist_the_royal_domain: "Resist the Royal Domain"
 resist_the_royal_domain_desc: "We are on the outer reaches of the French region, far from where royal power is absolute and easily enforced. We must resist the encroachment of these royalists at any cost, whether it is turning away their diplomatic intrigue or fighting their knights and soldiers on the field. Undoubtedly they will want to rein us in, but we will resist as much as we can in order to see an independent and glorious Armagnac."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region.

 sophias_power_desc: "From 1033 to 1093, after the death of Frederick III, Duke of Upper Lorraine, the cunning and grand Countess of Bar, Sophie, expanded the territory of Bar through various methods of political and diplomatic intrigue along with conquest and purchase. Even her descendants continued this path of expansion and brought Bar to grand prominence as a de facto independent border state betwixt the Germans and the French people. It is because of her that we owe our existence and fortune."
 french_politics_over_german_politics: "French Politics over German Politics"
 french_politics_over_german_politics_desc: "In deciding which side of the fence we'd be on, our French lineage dictated that we side with and become entrenched in French politics over German politics. As such, centuries of intermarriage and intrigue followed our choice and we have been quite prominent in our time within the French region."

 a_peer_of_france_desc: "A title bestowed upon nobles of distinction in the French region, the Count of Bar was recognized as one in 1354, leading it to become even more influential throughout French lands. Those who know how much power we wield and how firm our authority is will yield to us more easily, thanks in part to this prestigious title."
 ties_to_lorraine: "Ties to Lorraine"
 ties_to_lorraine_desc: "From the outset, the Duchy of Bar has been undoubtedly tied to Lorraine and its rulers. Though they may be different from us in various ways, the marriages and links between Bar and Lorraine are key and have helped ready our administration to take on different diplomatic affairs, both inside and outside of the French region."
 using_the_status_of_duchy: "Use the status of 'Duchy'"
 using_the_status_of_duchy_desc: "Being a duchy carries weight when speaking to others in the French region and even those in neighboring regions.

 fortify_the_lands_of_bar: "Fortify the Lands of Bar"
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar_desc: "Being initially a border state of sorts has had a inherent defensive affect on us. We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure. Better defensive measures will be found and implemented; the walls and garrisons of Bar will not go down without a fight fit for the ages."

 legacy_of_the_jaquerie_peasant_revolt_desc: "The peasant revolt during the Hundred Years' War othat took place in our land was significant in that, it rallied the people to a common cause and it greatly worried the nobility of the time.

 naval_ambitions_desc: "The English Channel is rife with opportunity, as is the North Sea, but we have yet to be able to truly venture out into these waters to obtain hegemony.

 history_with_the_royal_family_desc: "Our history with the royal family itself goes back several decades and it intertwines us with them essentially from our founding to now.

 participants_in_the_100_years_war_desc: "We were on the northern forefront of the Hundred Years' War and we saw the brunt of English forces invading into France itself.

 extinct_house_of_belleme_desc: "Though they are no longer around, the House of Belleme helped build the foundation of Alencon and gave us a reputation to begin building off of.

 ties_through_roger_de_montgomery_desc: "Roger de Montgomery of the 11th century may have started his life elsewhere, but his influence eventually stretched into the French region where him and his descendants gained substantial influence in Alenconnais land.

 juniors_of_the_royal_family_desc: "Though not quite a cadet branch, we are often related to the royal family themselves and seen as a sort of 'junior' part to them.

 legacy_of_john_the_magnificent_desc: "John the Magnificent, Duke of Berry, was the third son of King John II of France and helped propel Berry into prominence when he, along with others from around France at the time, served as regents for the young Charles VI.

 helping_end_the_western_schism_desc: "The Western Schism that was situated between the papal powers in Roma and Avignon was something that nearly tore Western and Central European powers apart on the religious and sometimes political level.

 patrons_of_parisian_and_italian_styles_desc: "John the Magnificent was a notable patron of grand works on the smaller scale instead of the architectual level. He was a patron of artistry that took on the Flemish and Parisian style of the time period, whilst also blending it with Italian styles such as the panel-painting techniques.

Would the people of Venad once again be subject to foreign rule?

Some time ago, our former ruler Aditya Varma resisted the likes of strange Muslim invaders on the borders of Venad, but that was not the last we saw of them.

 arapaho_warrior_culture_desc: "Much of our culture is based around the figure of warriors themselves. They play a very large part in Arapaho society and they are trained to be highly disciplined throughout life. So long as the Arapaho are around, the spirit of the warrior within the people will remain."

 expanding_the_arapaho_grounds_desc: "It is not enough that we control land tenuously and that other tribes think they can simply intrude onto what is rightfully our land without consequence.

 prepare_for_diplomatic_shifts_desc: "Though our long lasting friendships may do us well later on, they are not guaranteed to be stable throughout time.

 formalize_arapaho_divisons_desc: "The Arapaho people have traditionally been divided into five groups: the 'Southern People', the 'Rock People', the 'Arapaho Proper', the 'Big Lodge People', and the 'White Clay People'.

 connections_to_and_after_the_second_cheras_desc: "After the disappeareance of the Second Cheras in the early 12th century, Kolathunad and the Kolathiris were one of the benefactors in the partition of the kingdom. With their memory still around amidst the people of Kolathunad, there is a certain reputation that we have for being seen as a sort of successor to them. With this reputation, people of Tamil lineage often come to our court looking for work in a state seen as the proper successor to the Second Cheras, which we style ourselves as."
 combat_in_kerala: "Combat in Kerala"
 combat_in_kerala_desc: "Kerala is not for the uninitiated. It's jungles and harsh terrain make survival and fighting here a nightmare for many.

 organized_decentralization: "Organized Decentralization"
 organized_decentralization_desc: "We never have nor do exercise true absolute political power over the people of Koluthunad. We share our power with other officials and divisions of people so as to keep our state in working order and as such it has led to a great amount of success in regards to keeping tensions in local communities at a minimum."

 balance_the_matrilinial_divisions_desc: "The five matrilinial-divisions of the Kolathiri family serve to bolster administative efforts throughout Kolathunad, not just in the capital city. They are spread out in the land and work to keep taxation, communication, paperwork, and other administrative matters in order, and if we keep them alive and well, we will see rising support for our efforts, particularly military ones."

 source_of_heirs_to_others_desc: "If there is one thing that Koluthnad has been known for to others around Kerala and elsewhere in India, it is that we are a source of viable heirs for other dynasties. Though we may not have claimed thrones and titles like others might have, the children chosen as heirs for other dynasties have grown to be strong members and as such our reputation to those around us is something beyond just 'a neighbor'."

 cultivate_the_kolathiri_court_desc: "Throughout time, the Kolathiri court is something that remains central to Kolathunad. Other things may change around the state, but the court is where we see the past and present meet and come into harmonious contact with each other.

 six_major_apache_speaking_groups_desc: "The major groups of Apache speaking people may not be as close-knit as other groups of similarly speaking people, but we still recognize and commonality between all of us and that there should be unity over feuding. Though this doesn't always work out, it does for the most part and serves to bring more plentiful amounts of fighters for the Apache."

 early_nomadic_traditions_desc: "There was a time when we migrated to a great number of places and across vast amounts of land, hunting and seeking survival in the various conditions around us. Though we are not nearly as nomadic as before, the traditions that came with that way of life still influence the Apache people and make them much quicker on their feet."

 taking_to_settled_life_desc: "Settled life is something rather strange to some Apache people, but to most it is the natural progression from where we once were.

 tribal_exchanges: "Tribal Exchanges"

 apache_cavalry_desc: "The foreigners who dare encroach on our lands bring death and destruction to the Apache people, but the tools they use can be very handy for us in the future.

 firearms_and_raiding: "Firearms and Raiding"
 firearms_and_raiding_desc: "Taking up the advanced weaponry of our enemies is becoming a standard thing for the Apache people, yet still we can go further with them.

 partition_of_the_second_cheras_desc: "The fragmenting and partition of the Second Chera Empire changed the landscape of Tamilakam forever. The would-be successors all vied for land and no state directly related to them could attain the power they used to hold. Still, the remnants that live on today, us being one of them, are seen as the legitimate successors who carry on the legacy of this once great dynasty."

 conquer_by_courting_and_conferring_death_desc: "The Ernad Utayavar (governor) was given a royal sword by the last Cherman Perumal, Rama Varma Kulasekhara; with it, he was given the order to 'conquer by courting and conferring death', and with this motiviation and authority, he set out to conquer the territories of the kingdom of Polanad and beyond. It is this foundation from the Eradis that we obtain our military prowess from, and it something we must never forget."
 strategic_coastal_access:  "Strategic Coasts"
 strategic_coastal_access_desc: "The land on the coast of Kozhikode (Calicut) is rife with potential and for maritime trade, as our neighbors have no doubt exploited over the years.

 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals: "Lessons from Internal Struggles"
 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals_desc: "Before Kozhikode was a unified state, there were several rivals vying for dominance through countless conflicts and dynastic disputes. The title 'Samoothiri of Kozhikode' came about as a result trials and tribulations internally that hardened the people of the area into ones that are ready to face any threat against them, whether they are from within Tamilakam or outside of it."
 matrilineal_succession_system: "Matrilinial Succession System"
 matrilineal_succession_system_desc: "Though it may come as an unusual system to those outside of Kerala, the way of succession in Kozhikode is matrilineal in nature and has been so for centuries now. Keeping this tradition and ensuring it does not become interrupted or rife with corruption is a top priority for us as the system itself helps keep the populace and the administration satiated."
 implement_superior_economic_policies: "Implement Superior Economic Policies"
 implement_superior_economic_policies_desc: "The Samoothiri of Kozhikode must have a keen eye not only for administrative matters and military affairs, but also for economic policies. The waters around Southern India and the trade routes snaking throughout the region are rife with potential for increased revenue, especially through the port at Kozhikode, but we must be ready to put through policies that are directly beneficial to this."
 patronize_religious_scholars: "Patronize Religious Scholars"
 patronize_religious_scholars_desc: "Religious scholars from several places have travelled to Kozhikode to make a living from trading, but several have also looked to settle down in our land to promote theological debate and religious conversion. Though we are less than eager to let them simply convert our people to a different religion, there is wisdom in letting them live in peace and harmony within Kozhikode along with patronizing the unique religious works they produce."

 revenge_against_the_zamorin_of_calicut_desc: "Our rivarly against the Samoothiri of Kozhikode is something that has lasted ages now. Time and time again they come against the people of Kochin looking to subjugate them and the Raja of the land, but we must turn back these incursions whenever they approach! Revenge is what will be had by our people for the wounds they have inflicted upon us and we will be triumphant!"
 head_of_all_temples: "The Head of All Temples"
 head_of_all_temples_desc: "The Maharaja of Kochin may also be called the Gangadhara Kovil Adhikaarikal (Head of all Temples). With the Maharaja being the one to lead Kochin politically and also be a large religious figure within Kochin, they must also be able to be flexible in when using this title as new arrivals from different religious begin to come to our land for long-term trading purposes and long-term settlements."

 memory_of_the_last_chera_desc: "One of our ancestors from the area of Perumpadappu was spouse of the sister of the last Chera king, Rama Varma Kulashekhara. Because of this connection to the last true Chera, our ancestors obtained rights to not only temples and certain festivals, but also the legitimacy that the Chera Dynasty imposed upon its descendants. It would be wise of us to use this lineage to our advantage later on, should people question how legitimate our authority is."
 matrilineal_succession_in_the_royal_family: "Matrilinial Succession in the Royal Family"
 matrilineal_succession_in_the_royal_family_desc: "The royal family of Kochin practices a matrilineal form of succession and it often helps bring about a stable and relatively easy line of succession. Though some troublesome people appear in the dynastic lineage, there is no shortage of heirs in this system that dates back centuries."
 rekindle_far_off_diplomacy: "Rekindly Far Off Diplomacy"
 rekindle_far_off_diplomacy_desc: "When our rivals from Kozhikode tried to subjugate us, the people from far off lands in the east (this being the Ming Dynasty) attempted to mediate and thankfully sided with us instead of our devious rival. Though that connection to the eastern power is long gone and that fateful admiral who helped us is no longer around, we have the ambition and skill to rekindle this diplomacy from afar. Perhaps it won't just reach that old eastern power, but perhaps other places as well."

 cultivate_the_port_at_vypin_desc: "The island of Puthuvippu (Vypin) was created by a major flood in about 1341, but this flood did not bring with it pure destruction. This key island has now become a hub for our trade network and if we continue to cultivate it further, it can become a serious power in South Indian trade markets, perhaps even rivaling some of the other ports that have been prominent in the past."
 succeed_the_cheras: "Succeed the Cheras"
 succeed_the_cheras_desc: "Though some have easily forgotten the memory of the Chera Dynasty, Kerala is a place where their memory lives on without any sign of rest.

 ties_to_vijayanagar_desc: "We are inherently tied to the once giant power of Southern India, the Vijayanaga Empire. They bestowed upon us prestige and honor before, as well as materials and resources to begin our foundation; if we build upon this and also cultivate our inherent dynastic ties to the old empire, then we can have ourselves be viewed as a more legitimate dynasty amongst our own people whom they themselves remember the old empire well."

 patronize_srirangam_temple_and_others_desc: "The Srirangam Temple is perhaps one of the most stunning and awe-inspiring temples in our land, being a hub for Sri Vaishnavism and several other Hindus following other branches of Hinduism. Continued patronage of this central temple as well as the others of our land will undoubtedly garner us great praise, but also strategic tax and construction benefits for the future."
 promote_irrigation_projects: "Promote Irrigation Projects"
 promote_irrigation_projects_desc: "Irrigation is perhaps one of the most key things in all of our land. It is foundational to agricultural life and is something few powers seem to focus on, but our rulers know just how important it is for the growth and well-being of a society. If we subsidize and contribute to irrigation projects around the lands of Thanjavur, we will undoubtedly see better results with land development and land reclamation."

Let us continue this well-meaning patronage for the greater prosperity of Thanjavur."

 promote_an_educated_court_desc: "Just as we seek to educate the people of our land, so to do we seek to educate the people of our court.

 overcome_corruption_and_dissent_desc: "Though changes to the court of Thanjavur are not uncommon, with these changes come the possibility of corruption and unrest within the administrative body.

Even though times may be different, we still can implement what we learned from them and try to emulate certain parts of them, such as having an army as large as they once did. It may be a long way off, but we can at least strive for such a goal."

 build_up_gingee_fort_desc: "The fortress that is at the heart of our land is simply named: Gingee Fort. Simplistic in name, but unique in construction and layout, it serves as a model to build off of that is both uniquely defensive and self-sustaining.

 emulating_the_fortifications_of_gingee_desc: "The design of Gingee Fort is tough to replicate in its entirety, but our engineers are having an easier time changing it slightly to fit the various terrains present within our domain.

Even today we face these threats still, and even today we continue to fight back without backing down."
 expand_gingees_trade_sector: "Expand the Trade Sector"
 expand_gingees_trade_sector_desc: "Trade is increasingly becoming the life-blood of several states in Southern India. Taxation has its benefits, but the waters around Southern India are highly valuable and worth so much more than simple taxation at times, so who are we to just sit around and let that trade revenue sit on its own? We are going to actively promote and invest in the Gingee trade sector, that is what we'll do! Just as our neighbors are doing for themselves!"
 influencing_neighboring_politics: "Influence Neighboring Politics"
 influencing_neighboring_politics_desc: "The surrounding states of Gingee are full of local politics and we do understand this, but influence leaks into others states, whether it is ours into theirs or vice versa. Perhaps we can capitalize on this simple notion and bolster our own influence in our neighbors through diplomatic means, both legitimate and under-the-table."
 far_off_relations: "Far Away Relations"
 far_off_relations_desc: "The trade routes and politics of our neighbors has naturally led us to meeting far off states that are unlike Gingee in the slightest. They may follow different religions, have different customs, and fight in a completely different manner, but that doesn't mean we can't try to have good tidings with them at first and later on. From first impressions to long-term diplomatic relationships, Gingee must be an expert in diplomatic matters at all times."

 techniques_of_vijayangar: "Techniques of the Vijayanagara Empire"
 techniques_of_vijayangar_desc: "Though they are unjust at times, we cannot deny the fact that the Vijayanagara Empire has had its benefits for us of Keladi.

We would be foolish to throw these lessons away and to start from scratch."

 reform_agricultural_and_taxation_methods_desc: "An age old practice it is, in a sense, but it is always needed: land reform. Keladi is no different in this sense, with us needing to reform how land is distributed and tilled and taxed.

 adaptation_of_firearms_desc: "With the introduction of firearms all around states in India, it is no new fact that the soldiers of Carnatic are already experimenting with how they can be used and improved for later on.

 fortifications_of_arcot_desc: "For a long time, Arcot at the heart of our nation has been a sight of great fortifications. They have been compounded upon over the decades, and still prove effective in preparing the defenders of Carnatic for whatever may come for them.

 after_the_end_of_mayapan_desc: "What precipatated the end of the League of Mayapan was the disastrous civil war between us and the Cocomes.

 monte_alban_our_old_heart_desc: "Our old empire's heart was the populous center of Monte Alban. It was here that the Zapotec people thrived and expanded from for centuries before being eclipsed by other cities, but who is to say this old heart of ours is left to rot? There is life in it yet, and the Zapotec people can still revitalize it and become the grand political entity it once was, but even greater!"

 destroy_regional_powers_and_unite_desc: "Regional powers are an existential threat to the Atepetl of the Zapotec people.

 reform_zapotec_writing_and_language_desc: "Our writing and language systems are some of the oldest in the region, but like others around us, it gets mixed toegther and changed around thanks to the influence of other cultures around us. It would be wise of us to reform the Zapotec writing system and language altogether and codify both so that there is a distinct and unique Zapotec identity that also helps adminsitrative matters flow with ease."

 trading_in_obsidian_and_jade_desc: "Some of the most prized resources in the region, jade and obsidian, are traded as luxury goods in Zapotec lands and throughout the regions around us.

 learning_from_our_enemies_the_iroquois_desc: "The enemies of our people, the Iroquois, are not without their merits. They have made war against several people related to us and have little mercy on our people, but they do cultivate some interesting characteristics in society, such as formalized expansion and settlments. Perhaps it is time that the Abenaki learn from this and take to making our own settlements to rival them."

 techniques_from_surrounding_combat_desc: "Around us, we have had conflicts with several people groups and tribes seeking to plunder our wealth and to completely take over the land of the Abenaki.

 well_meaning_abenaki_people_desc: "We have been described by foreigners, despite how different we are, as docile and ingenious.

 highly_deliberative_decision_making: "Highly Deliberative Decision Making"
 highly_deliberative_decision_making_desc: "The administration of the Abenaki people is very tedious and deliberative in the decision it makes. The foundation of it is meant to be in touch with the common Abenaki people of our land, making decisions that are good for not only the good of them, but for the good of everyone who is Abenaki. It is tough to pass legislation at times, but it helps keep the people content and our administration running smoothly."

 continue_the_story_telling_desc: "The story-telling tradition of our ancestors has been with for generation upon generation and each one builds upon it with new stories from their experiences.

 formation_of_the_iron_confederacy_desc: "There is a need for strength not simply obtained by staying as we are.

We will create, in time, the Iron Confederacy to better defend and administrate ourselves."
 assiniboine_political_power: "Assiniboine Political Power"
 assiniboine_political_power_desc: "Our political authority in our land is known by all, but outwards it is rarely recognized. The Assiniboine are stronger than many think, and the proclamation of ourselves as true confederacy over a mere tribe is a mark of this; those who stand against us are foolish to do so. Those that we conquer will join us and know peace under our just authority."
 semi_nomadic_traditions: "Semi-Nomadic Traditions"
 semi_nomadic_traditions_desc: "The lands around us necessitated that we use both agricultural and nomadic ways of life in conjunction with each other.

 modernize_trade_relations: "Modernize Trade Relations"
 modernize_trade_relations_desc: "With the coming wave of new technologies and mercantile methods, the Assiniboine are at risk of losing out on valuable trading opportunities.

 diversify_and_adapt_economically: "Adapating our Economy"
 diversify_and_adapt_economically_desc: "The environment around our people is changing and the animals from before are no longer as plentiful as they once were. This is going to create a crisis within our society if we do not diversify and adapt the economy to the upcoming problems and we will do just that: invest in various other areas of viable resource extraction and refinement so as to help our people and our economy prosper and become more resistant to changes in global trends."

 the_original_three_peoples: "The Original Three Peoples"
 the_original_three_peoples_desc: "The Blackfoot are not merely one people group, but rather, three separate tribal nations merged into one confederacy of sorts. The Piikáni, Káínaa, and the Siksikáwa all come together long ago into this confederation since they all spoke the same language and shared kinship between them. It is from the confederation that we find foundational power and solace."
 flexible_bands_for_blackfoot_society: "Flexibility in our Bands"
 flexible_bands_for_blackfoot_society_desc: "The bands of Blackfoot society are highly decentralized in that, they may vary in size greatly (80 - 240 people). They are constantly shifting around in both how large they are and how they break up and reform since they are allowed to do as such with little consequence. This system of decentralization yet social cohesion allows us to keep the confederacy strong and united."
 promote_the_warrior_societies: "Blackfoot Warrior Societies"
 promote_the_warrior_societies_desc: "Though we may see unification in our people, outside there are those who would see us torn apart. That is why we value the warriors of our land and the socieites within our own that train young men to become strong fighters for the Blackfoot. Without them, we'd suffer the ravages our rivals and risk being wiped out altogether, or worse yet, instability and loss of societal structure."
 expanding_blackfoot_grounds: "Expanding Blackfoot Grounds"
 expanding_blackfoot_grounds_desc: "As time goes forth, the borders of the Blackfoot expand and so do the number of bands we have within our land. It isn't uncommon to hear people petitioning for new land to be settled beyond what we call home; perhaps these petitions can be put to good use?"
 taming_the_plains_by_force: "Taming the Plains"
 taming_the_plains_by_force_desc: "The plains by which we come from are by no means friendly to us. Rival people groups seek our destruction and treasure for themselves, but with the arrival of these new foreigners, perhaps the plains we call home can become something more useful. The only issue being? We must use force to tame those who inhabit the plains, and we will do as such."
 the_use_of_bison: "The Use of Bison"
 the_use_of_bison_desc: "Bison! Used by all within Blackfoot society, the great creature is almost sacred to us, as some might think. Regardless if it is or isn't, we use all parts of the bison when possible and make sure no parts of it go to waste. Spreading this mentality of using anything and everything when possible and viable is a rather efficient mindset and should serve to improve the productivity of Blackfoot people."
 neutrality_in_various_affairs: "Diplomatic Neutrality"
 neutrality_in_various_affairs_desc: "Conflicts around us are not isolated in the slightest. There are those who try to draw us into various diplomatic affairs that could lead to dire circumstances later on, something we'd rather avoid if we can. By choosing neutrality in these various upcoming affairs, we'll be able to promote our reputation as a fair and honorable dealer in the wider political community at large."

 memory_of_magha_the_tyrant_desc: "Kalinga Magha was the one who established our kingdom in the midst of the 13th century and was the first member of the Aryacakravarti Dynasty. His invasion and conquest was so harsh and so complete that it resulted in a major migration of Sinhalese people southward on the island itself. Such a reputation is prestigious in its own right, and the methods of ensuring authority and stability within his kingdom back then are not lost on the people of Jaffna today."

 two_capitals_of_nallur_and_puttalam_desc: "Our two capitals of Nallur and Puttalam are useful in that, they switch between being our official capital regularly when the seasons change for pearling. It may be a strange system to others, but it has worked for us for so long now, why change it? The productive nature of having two capitals is something that we embrace, rather than reject."
 diversify_the_economy_of_jaffna: "Diversify the Economy"
 diversify_the_economy_of_jaffna_desc: "Trading in the Indian Ocean comes with its own set of issues and benefits. The states around us are actively adapting to the nature of trading in it and Jaffna should be no exception.

 memories_of_fighting_the_kotte_kingdom_desc: "Our enemies in the south of the island were our long-time enemies. The Kingdom of Kotte was the foremost of these enemies and on several occasions did we beat each other mercilessly.

 ties_with_southern_india: "Ties with Southern India"
 ties_with_southern_india_desc: "We are seen as a haven for refugees and dissidents on the coasts of Southern India. Routinely we will have arrivals of people who are fleeing because of political strife or community problems and we welcome them, sometimes on certain conditions. These who seek refuge are, after all, quite useful as possible agents or insurgents back from where they came, especially if we arm them ourselves."
 buddhist_sinhalese_people: "Buddhist Sinhalese People"
 buddhist_sinhalese_people_desc: "The Buddhist population on the island we call home is significant enough to take note of.

 organized_military_payment_system: "Organized Military Payment System"
 organized_military_payment_system_desc: "What helped us stand out amongst the other kingdoms around us was the rather unique miltary payment system we had built up for ourselves.

 settlers_of_the_mississippi_river_desc: "Ages ago, we settled along the rivers like many others, but few were as prominent as us in how widespread we soon became.

 fighting_the_osage_and_co: "Fighting Rival Tribes"
 fighting_the_osage_and_co_desc: "The rivers attracted several people before and still do today. Thus, control over the rivers is not universal and we have had to assert Caddo authority over certain parts when necessary. This legacy of fighting for control of fertile grounds is something we must keep true to ourselves as our life-blood and ancestry are at stake when our control of the rivers are threatened."
 forming_internal_confederacies: "Forming Internal Confederacies"
 forming_internal_confederacies_desc: "With the expansion of the Caddo population over time, it is only natural that certain division arise between families and communities.

 great_plains_trade_hub: "Great Plains Trade Hub"
 great_plains_trade_hub_desc: "The work we've done to cultivate a strong and unique Caddo society hasn't gone unnoticed.

 building_the_caddo_nation_desc: "The Caddo people hunger for something more than the tribal ways of our past. They strive to become more than they once were in the past, and with new technologies and ideas spreading throughout the countless Caddo communities, who are we to deny them this?

 rival_after_rival_around_us_desc: "There are several tribes around us who would see us wiped out or driven to less fertile and more harsh terrain.

They take on administraitve matters for all Cheyenne people and is made up mainly peaceful chiefs, but as time goes on, they will encounter new matters that the Cheyenne people have never faced before.

We take them very seriously and what they predict, and what they have come to us with recently is tales of new weaponry and technology just on the horizon, brought to us by people who will seek to strike us down at all points. We must these predicted technologies (when they come to us) and use them against our enemies and rivals, to help ensure the safety and survival of the Cheyenne people."
 hit_and_run_tactics: "Hit and Run!"
 hit_and_run_tactics_desc: "Of these new things brought to us from far away lands, the horse has been perhaps one of the most valuable.

One of the most notable of these has been from Teotihuacan, a city to our east that flourished some ages ago but has sense faded away. The influences from the city, however, lasted in our people, especially in our building methods and culture, both of which have flourished since the loss of Teotihuacan."
 toltec_memories: "Toltec Memories"
 toltec_memories_desc: "The Toltec Empire was perhaps one of the greatest forces we have ever seen in the region. Its influence spread across vast swaths of land, including ours to a degree, and though their empire may be gone from the maps of today, their memories still ring true in our people and court today. Influential families of Toltec descent are still around and if we cultivate our court properly, we can attract these families in due to time to serve at our court."
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco: "The Salt Fields of Tzacoalco"
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco_desc: "The salt from these fields are quite valuable to many people.

 defending_against_the_purepechas_desc: "Rivals? Enemies? One in the same. The Purepechas to our east have long been ones to try to cut down the Colima state from its position, but we stand against them at all times.

 chichimeca_guamar_threats: "The Threats from the North"
 chichimeca_guamar_threats_desc: "The wild ones to our north, the Chichamecans and Guamar, are undoubtedly threats to Colima and its people. The ancestors of those wild fiends are what brought down the great Toltec Empire and it is from that example that we must learn. Fielding a larger and more effective military is perhaps the most obvious and most effective solution that our people are resorting to and it is something that we should actively endorse to stave off not only these threats, but perhaps others as well."
 usage_of_obsidian: "Usage of Obsidian"
 usage_of_obsidian_desc: "Obsidian has long been in use by our people; generations upon generations have used it for both civilian and militaristic purposes. The tools developed with obsidian parts seem to work well and as a result, we are having an easier time developing the land to our liking."

 state_for_the_tecos_people_desc: "The Tecos have previously not been united in every sense. Divides in communities would bubble up into being full-on feuds that would cause chaos in our lands, but we are transcending those times now.

This can either be helpful or harmful to our society, depending on how our religious traditions develop, but we will do our best to steer them into a direction of tolerance and acceptance, with nagualism being integral to that acceptance."
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures: "Surrounding Cultural Influences"
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures_desc: "We have taken in influence from other cultures around, like the Maya, Mixtecs, Zapotecs, and Purepechas, leading us to be a sort of multi-cultural society that fuses several other elements into the central Tlapanec culture. It would be wise of us to reach out and accept those other cultures that once contributed to our own so that a more peaceful exchange of traditions and customs may take place in the future, rather than having cultural isolation take place."
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments: "Cotton Garments"
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments_desc: "They may be fanciful to some and useless to others, but we know just how useful they can be. From stopping arrows to stopping the blades of obsidian weapons, the armor we fashion from cotton is becoming more and more useful for the Tlapanec warriors, and bolstering production of cotton will help out our production revenue as well as stockpiles of cotton for later use."
 fighting_the_aztecs: "Fighting the Aztecs"
 fighting_the_aztecs_desc: "Time and time again the Aztec people invade our land for tribute and land. Though we drive them out time after time, they encroach further into our domain with each push. It is time we learn to fight them on equal terms and drill our warriors as they do, promoting warrios of merit and skill rather than warriors of noble blood alone. They will not stand to invade use anymore; we will resist the Aztecs."
 cultivate_larger_dominions: "Cultivate Larger Dominions"
 cultivate_larger_dominions_desc: "There are barely any large cities in our area; only villages to small towns of people, but still we maintain control over them with some ease. It would be in the best interest of the Tlapanec people if these villages and towns grew in size to become more powerful and prosperous cities, capable of giving us viable warriors and workers for all parts of society."
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec: "What is Rightfully Tlapanec"
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec_desc: "Tlapanec land is rugged and harsh, but not hopeless. There have been slow efforts to cultivate the land further beyond what it currently is, but the jungle and weather constantly hamper our endeavors to do so. If we can concentrate our workforce and advance our tool quality, perhaps we can make faster progress for all of the Tlapanec people."
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state: "An Integrated Tlapanec State"
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state_desc: "After growing and becoming what we are now, it's only right that we attempt to centralize authority and focus on internal matters so that our people are prosperous and not suffering from inabilities on our part. Educational measures are what is next for us, integrating educational reforms and places of learning all around the Tlapanec realm so that the commoner may learn what was once only available to the noble class."

 three_hearts_three_cities: "Taijin, Cempoala, and Teayo"
 three_hearts_three_cities_desc: "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Taijin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."

 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture_desc: "We are known for our craft work in pottery, ceramins, sculptures, and architecture.

 ceremonial_centers: "Ceremonial Centers"
 ceremonial_centers_desc: "We have several centers where ceremonies, both religious and cultural, take place. The upkeep of them is tough at times, but the effort is well worth it due to the strengthening of our faith through them. Building more and refining our traditions done at these centers will do not only the commoners good, but our priestly class and noble class as well; we just simply need to ease them into these upcoming reforms."
 non_human_sacrifices: "Non-Human Sacrifices"
 non_human_sacrifices_desc: "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."
 preserving_totonac_culture: "Preserving Totonac Culture"
 preserving_totonac_culture_desc: "There are several who would see Totonac culture be absorbed into their own and these influences are spreading throughout Totonac society. We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."
 against_the_aztecs: "Against the Aztecs"
 against_the_aztecs_desc: "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."
 rebuilding_taijin: "Rebuilding Taijin"
 rebuilding_taijin_desc: "Burned down in a fire so long ago, but still within our memory. Taijin must not ever be forgotten and its place must be kept sacred within the hearts of the Totonac people. Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

 memories_of_the_tepanec_empire_desc: "In ages past, we were the subjects of the Tepanec Empire. They may not have lasted long, but the system of master-to-subject that they enforced was good groundwork for us to build off of. If we continue to cultivate it and reform it as time goes on, we can ensure a friendly and good relationship with our future subjects."
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs: "Fending off Foes"
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs_desc: "From two sides we are threatened: the Purepechas and the Aztecs. They both seek our land and people, but we would rather not be subjects to either if we can help it. We must resist them and strive to maintain our independent status; there must be a true state for the Matlatzinca people, not a petty subject state that is abused by overlords."
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions: "Fortify Toluca Valley"
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions_desc: "Toluca Valley is our home and has been for centuries now. The valley in it is clear for all to see and as such there are many who want it under their control. We must, as a result, fortify it and barricade it from invasions so as to ensure the prosperity and safety of the Matlatzinca people."
 tight_administrative_structure: "Tight Administrative Structure"
 tight_administrative_structure_desc: "Through the nature of how the Matlatzinca people live in the Toluca Valley, the administrative structure has to be close-knit and centralized. This may be strange to outsiders, but for us, it is natural and needed. A decentralized system will simply lead to the breakup of all Matlatzinca cities and what power they hold."
 develop_matlatzinco: "Develop Matlatzinco"
 develop_matlatzinco_desc: "Our core city, Matlatzinco, may not be as big as other cities around us, but it is what we call our capital and what we shall develop into a grand place for the Matlatzinca people. From here, we shall enjoy greatness and prosperity."

 shadow_of_the_aztecs_desc: "The core of the Aztecs is found in Tenochtitlan and the Triple Alliance that was formed between it, Texcoco, and Talcopan. The influence from those three cities stretches far and wide, even to the lands of Coixtlahuaca, thus making us in their shadow partially. It is not all dark for us, however, as we can and have been learning from them for sevreal decades now. Let us put this knowledge into practice and unite our people beyond their previous ties, like the Aztecs in the north have."
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica: "Multiple Cultures"
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica_desc: "There are two prominent cultures found within Coixtlahuaca: the Choncho and the Mixtec. Gradually this will change and we will grow to encompass more cultures within the borders of our state and when we do, we must be accepting of them as we have been with the Choncho and Mixtec so far. Cultural cooperation is not simply good for us, it is needed if we wish to survive to become larger and stronger."
 plain_of_snakes: "'Plain of Snakes'"
 plain_of_snakes_desc: "Our name translates to 'plain of snakes' and whilst to some this might be ambiguous, it is quite obvious to us: the land is rife with snakes! Harmful ones at that!

 aztec_attributes: "Aztec Attributes"
 aztec_attributes_desc: "We have inherited various traits and traditions from the Aztecs over the decades and with them have come ceremonial customs that have become integrated with our own. Part of them emphasize hierarchy in society and the positions of 'Cuauhtlatoani', 'Tlatoani', and 'Huehuetlatoani', amongst others. By keeping certain legitimizing rituals together and within Coixtlahuaca, we can keep our royal family and leader in power with the utmost loyalty from our people."
 mixtec_connections: "Mixtec Connections"
 mixtec_connections_desc: "The Mixtec are known for their stone crafts as well as architectual style and are also integral to Coixtlahuaca. If we can utilize their craft work for our own projects, we'll see better and more refined buildings rise up in our land, as well as ones that are just nicer to look at in general."
 nahuatl_language_prominence: "The Nahuatl Language"
 nahuatl_language_prominence_desc: "The main language within our court is Nahuatl and its the same for several courts near to Coixtlahuaca, as it should be. As time goes on, we will promote and refine the language as we see fit to help our efforts in both our administration, military, and diplomatic sector. It'll be a unifying force within Coixtlahuaca."

Let others around us know this, and let them know that our status beneath the gods is holier than theirs; none shall be above us in this regard."
 makers_of_dyes: "Makers of Dyes"
 makers_of_dyes_desc: "Traditionally we produce good quantities of dyes for ourselves and surrounding places. It is a rather rare commodity and as such it's valued throughout several places around us; bolstering and spreading its production out will only serve to increase the sale of these dyes that we produce, and we will profit from this in time."

 at_the_foot_of_the_mountain_desc: "In Zapotec, our name is Xaguixe, meaning 'at the foot of the mountain'.

 celestial_constellation: "'Celestial Constellation'"
 celestial_constellation_desc: "Our original name, 'Xaquija' means 'celestial constellation' and with it, a god came from the heavens in the form of a bird, accompanied by a constellation of stars and founded a temple here. From here, and with the mythical foundation of the large stone split in half with the name of the Stone of the Sun, we claim even greater religious authority, but this time branching into the Zapotec area of things. Even with this, the Zapotec and Aztec mytholigies are becoming interconnected as time goes on and as such, our religious authority is becoming even stronger, stronger than any of those around us."
 aztec_fighting_spirit: "Aztec Fighting Spirit"
 aztec_fighting_spirit_desc: "The Aztecs did not impart merely religious traditions upon us, but also military traditions. The fighting spirit and warrior ranks of their society is something that we need and promote greatly, and with them in mind, our warriors will become more capable in battle."

 zapotec_influences_desc: "The Zapotec people are widespread in our communities, similar to the Aztecs.

 nahuatl_bastion_desc: "The Nahuatl pantheon and language, and even the great Nahua culture must be kept alive and sacred.

 three_traditional_mixtec_groups_desc: "The three groups within Mixtec society that divide the us into a sort of societal hierarchy has been around for several generations now and it has served us well in keeping things in order, despite our spread out communities.

 foremost_goldsmiths_desc: "People from all around the region know just who to go to if they want work in gold done, and done right: the Mixtecs.

 resistant_mixtec_city_states_desc: "The Mixtec people are necessarily united on all matters. There is an extensive history of division between the various city-states that are inhabited by Mixtecs, but this division does not mean lack of resistance. Indeed several are able to take up arms against invaders and it is this military tradition from the past that we remember well from them."

 reform_the_mixtec_codices_desc: "For so many years now, the codices we've crafted have been used by several different people groups for various different things, from educational to cultural purposes. In time, however, we will need to refine how we make and craft them as they are sometimes disorganized and without a clear direction in them. By refining them, we can better spread education and ideas throughout Mixtec society."

 mastery_of_jewelery_and_mosaic_crafting_desc: "Not only are we famous as goldsmiths, but our mastery of jewelry and mosaic pieces is also well known throughout the regions.

 tepehuan_festivals_and_celebrations_desc: "The many festivals of the Tepehuan people are spectacular from the outset, but they aren't as widespread as we would like.

 malvi_authorities_desc: "The authority from the Sultanate of Malwa is overbearing at times, but it does bring with it benefits that we would not otherwise get to see. One of these benefits is the introduction of firearms to the state of Garha, and in seeing how useful they've been for the Malvi people, using it for ourselves could make things all the more easier when fighting other powers around.

 fortify_the_holdings_of_khandesh_desc: "Fortifications in our land are routinely being challenged by new siege tactics and weaponry, necessitating better defensive measures and a more efficient way of running the garrisons within. By continually compounding upon our succesful renovations from before, the fortifications we hold close to us will serve as great barriers to the enemies of Khandesh."
 satiate_the_minorities: "Satiate the Minorities"
 satiate_the_minorities_desc: "Like many other sultanates before Khandesh, the minorities of Hindustan are plentiful, seeking both recognition and local power when they are conquered (that is, if they do not revolt or have their revolts suppressed). Being as traditional sultanates are, we seek to work with and accept these minority groups rather than to alienate them, thus bringing Khandesh into a greater state of ease and promoting better social cohesion."

 what_may_have_been_vijayapura_and_po_ni_desc: "The history from before we became part of the wider Muslim world is murky and unclear, but we do have some indication that there were states existing before us, such as Vijayapura and Po-ni. These smaller states were subjects of at times Srivijaya, Chinese powers, or Majapahit, but all contributed to the culmination of a greater Bruneian identity as time went on. Even today, we still feel the effects of these past states in our own court, and for this influence we are thankful."
 lessons_from_srivijaya_and_majapahit: "Lessons from Srivijaya and Majapahit"
 lessons_from_srivijaya_and_majapahit_desc: "Undoubtedly we have influences from Srivijaya and Majapahit. Both were once great giants on the stage of the Nusantara Archipelago and have since declined greatly from their golden ages, but their influence on us is unmistakable. We will incorporate what we have learned from both powers into our own state and we can surely be the next great empire of these wondrous islands of culture, religion, and trade."
 chinese_influences: "Chinese Influences"
 chinese_influences_desc: "The Chinese, dating all the way back to the Song Dynasty, have had great amounts of influence in their own waters to the north, but also to the waters in the south, where we call home. Our submission to them as a tributary status some time ago helped influence part of culture, and even though we no longer pay tribute to the Chinese, we still do earn ourselves a good name with powers around us from this healthy relationship we've cultivated with them."
 trading_in_nusantara: "Trading amongst the Islands"
 trading_in_nusantara_desc: "The various islands of Nusantara are rich in both culture and religion, but also in resources to cultivate. The resources cultivated and traded off are the life-blood of empires and kingdoms and sultanates in the archipelago and we are no exception. It would be in our best interest to partake in this trading tradition and invest time and effort into making sure trade goes in our favor, as opposed to our rivals."
 promote_thalassocratic_control: "Promote Thalassocratic Control"
 promote_thalassocratic_control_desc: "The nature of our region of islands is such that, mere land armies are not enough. Naval superiority is absolutely key to ensuring dominance in both peaceful times and times of war and we of Brunei know this all too well. It is our duty, then, to ensure ourselves a large and great navy to promote our own control over these water ways, and to disallow our rivals from gaining the high ground on this matter."
 cross_island_empire: "Multi-Island Empire"
 cross_island_empire_desc: "Like those before us, we reach out and touch several islands with our power in order to properly assert control over the territories inherently valuable to Nusantara. It won't be easy to do, but the Bruneian administration is ready to enforce laws and regulations in more localized areas that our nation reaches out toward; when all is said and done, unification will be a reality we can achieve, and one that Brunei will attain for itself."

That is our the coming golden age for our people, and not only is it a glorious sight to behold when it arrives, but it will be a milestone for us where upon we expand further than ever and set our ambitions beyond our home island of Borneo and those others nearby. The world is vast and in need of authority that can make the land and people profitable and prosperous, and it is those of Brunei who know how to make this happen."

We are one of those echoes, the Icelanders, and with that Viking legacy in our people, we will once again partake in explorations across the cold waters of the north and raid commerce from nations hostile to us. Beware the harsh north..."

 revitalize_the_legacy_of_the_althing_desc: "There vestiges of the althing in Iceland still, what with it being established in the early 900s and continuing on from there and then going into a decline once Christianity was introduced into Iceland. Still, it is an important part of Icelandic history and one of the oldest parliaments in the world; using its legacy and perhaps even revitalizing it in the coming years could bring legitimacy and stability to the land once more."
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism: "Geographic Isolation and Opportunism"
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism_desc: "Isolation is something very familiar to Icelanders. But, what our ancestors knew that some people today forget is that Iceland is close to the lands of what is called Greenland, and our old sagas do tell of our ancestors travelling to here and beyond. We can use our isolation in geography, then, as an advantage and begin efforts to expand our domain outward through colonization efforts that are more organized and more effective than the ones our ancestors put forth."
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade: "Promote Icelandic Commerce"
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade_desc: "Yes, commerce from Iceland is remote and hard to reach, but it is worth the travel for some people, such as those from Ireland, Scotland, Norway, and other northern-oriented nations. If we can entice more consumers to come north and engage with the Icelandic merchants more than in previous ages, then we will see profits over time (along with more visitors... It gets lonely here in Iceland)."
 effects_of_the_reformation: "Effects of the Reformation"
 effects_of_the_reformation_desc: "Europe has apparently been home to religious strife of a different kind that is unfamiliar to the people of Iceland. These so called Protestants and Reformed folks are springing up all over Europe and, well, Icelanders are curious as to what will come of themselves now that they too are feeling the effects of the Reformation. Whatever path is chosen for Iceland, the notion of serving the people and promoting stability no matter what will be our primary goal."

 use_our_naval_legacy_desc: "What we lack in terms of a formal army we make up for in the form of a fearsome navy. By continuing to build it up and refine our naval practices, there will be few who can put up a genuine fight against our naval dominance. After the waters are secure, we can then focus on our efforts on land."
 norse_resurgence: "Norse Resurgence"
 norse_resurgence_desc: "The Norse may have changed a lot since the days of the Vikings and their dominance over the northern shores and waters, but those of Iceland can still recall their memories clearly compared to the likes of Norway, Denmark, or Sweden. With this legacy, the Norse will rise again as they expand out, they will once more engage in bloody wars of raiding and conquest.

 former_fuedatory_of_delhi_desc: "The memories of when we were a feuadtory underneath the likes of the Delhi Sultanate are not forgotten in the slightest; much of our administration is still somewhat based on what the sultanate introduced to our people, meaning we take after certain laws and measures from the ground up. One essential part that we have put work into integrating into Gwalior is the effective tax system they left behind, meaning we are able to obtain much higher revenues from the people of our land than other states around us."
 rebels_against_delhi: "Rebels Against Delhi"
 rebels_against_delhi_desc: "The earliest record of us rebelling against the likes of Delhi are in 1391-1392 under our leader of the time, Virasimha, but this was met with defeat by the general Islam Khan. Still, Virashimha was not executed and he worked tirelessly to undermine Delhi's efforts to integrate and keep hold of Gwalior, to which he obtained success some years later. As we well know, there are plenty of others who rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate, and many of those revolting nations would likely be our friends later on."

 jain_scholars_in_gwalior_desc: "Virama, who ruled Gwalior from 1402-1423, had an immense amount of Jain scholars come through and set up residence inside of Gwalior and with them saw the rise in new ideas being spread about. If we continue to allow Jains into Gwalior and seek out a mutualistic relationship with them, the prosperity of the state could increase by so much more than we think."

 between_delhi_and_malwa_desc: "With the decline of the Delhi Sultanate came other sultanates in its place, one of the most prominent ones being to our south: the Sultanate of Malwa. Both the remains of Delhi and Malwa to our south pose great threats to the likes of Gwalior and its people, so it would be beneficial to learn better military strategies from both powers when possible whilst also preparing for any invasion either power might try for."
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others: "Asylum to Dissidents"
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others_desc: "With the downfall of Delhi comes dissidents who wish to use there skills against their former overlord, or perhaps some other power in the region. Though many states will reject said dissidents, why should Gwalior? We revolted from Delhi, we should be a practical haven for these kinds of people! And we can make good use of them and obtain connections, both shady and formal, with powers around the subcontinent and perhaps even beyond."
 improving_defensive_measures: "Improving Defenses in Gwalior"
 improving_defensive_measures_desc: "The central fortress, Gwalior Fort, is key to our power, certainly, but there is more to us than that central fort. With a defensive mentality in mind, we must prepare a more stringent and effective defense in our homeland so that any invaders will suffer even more when coming through. Partisan attacks, strange explosives buried in the ground that explode with enough pressure, and traps at various points, all can be employed by Gwalior to help thwart foreign invasions."
 rajput_diplomacy: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 rajput_diplomacy_desc: "Connections with the Rajput people are strong within Gwalior. We are not full Rajputs ourselves, but we have taken after several traditions and customs that the Rajputs themselves have, including around diplomacy. Though we have refined it over the years, this sort of Rajput diplomacy for the people of Gwalior is flexible and our policies are more fluid than in other states around us so that we can adapt to changing circumstances, whatever they may be."

 rao_underneath_the_sisodias_desc: "Our ruler, when underneath the leaders of Mewar, take on the title of Rao (a different form of Raja). With this in mind, we are designated more toward maintaining the lands that Mewar cannot govern themselves and thus must learn to field more military regiments in a more refined manner, thus keeping this land under lock-and-key and safely producing revenue."
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe: "Legacy of the Meena Tribe"
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe_desc: "Before the time of the Rajput invasion of this land, there was the Meena tribe who stayed here, claiming descent all the way back toward the Matsya Kingdom. Though most are gone from power now in Hadoti, some still remain as prominent members of Hadoti society and their legacy of having more respect for women than more traditional Hindu states is felt throughout all of Hadoti, especially in our own court."
 rajput_meena_intermingling: "Rajput-Meena Intermingling"
 rajput_meena_intermingling_desc: "The two groups may have fought each other to a bloody end in the previous centuries, but that time is over now. We must work on reconciling these differences within Hadoti itself and also work on enjoining these two populations into one cohesive unit that Hadoti can rely on, for, times of war and times of disaster do not discriminate based on tribal or clan membership, they take from and stike at anyone and everyone."
 handing_down_of_martial_traditions: "Handing Down of Martial Traditions"
 handing_down_of_martial_traditions_desc: "Our connections with Mewar have been strong in the past, and as a result of this strong connection with them there has been a mutual exchange of knowledge between Hadoti and its overlord. The martial training and traditions from the Rajput heartland are plentiful and the military of Hadoti is ever thankful that they are included in the sharing these traditions."
 dynastic_support_from_mewar: "Dynastic Support"
 dynastic_support_from_mewar_desc: "When push came to shove in the past for Hadoti, the royals of Mewar could be relied on for backing up our claims or our side in a dispute. We can still use this leverage today or perhaps even rely on our own connections not in the royals of Mewar to bolster our own dynasty, especially on the international stage."
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans: "Cultivation of Rajput Clans"
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans_desc: "The plentiful clans of Rajput people are ready to serve Hadoti, they simply need to be organized and given strong leadership from us. Our own efforts to institute viable candidates for leadership are going well so far and the beneficial relationship between the Hadoti government and the clans is infact helping things progress, so we should expect the Rajput powerbase within us expand and be ready for future conflicts."
 taking_after_the_sisodias: "Taking after the Sisodias"
 taking_after_the_sisodias_desc: "The Sisodias of Mewar were unique in several ways, one of which was in how illustrious they were and how they tried to make themselves out to be above other Rajput clans through poetry and other art forms. Perhaps it is time that those of Hadoti do the same? We could separate ourselves from the other clans, rise above them, and promote the royalty of Hadoti as the grand and true leaders, above all others... It sounds nice, doesn't it?"

 rajput_and_malvi_influences_desc: "We are at the confluence of both Rajput communities and incoming Malvi influences from the east. Both hold great sway in Baglana and both at times create friction when they meet each other, but when combined properly, they create a militaristic nature that is unlike anything around us. Baglana can only benefit from such a combination of forces."
 the_fake_subject_state: "The Fake Subject"
 the_fake_subject_state_desc: "Previous invaders have come through our land and subjugated a few chiefs and simply thought that the entirety of Baglana was underneath them, but they were greatly mistaken. Tribute to be paid? Irregular at best. Troops to be levied? Maybe, maybe not. Baglana has always been a tenuous, or rather, fake subject state and it will continue to be so, inspiring our people to strive for freedom from these incursions against us."
 our_natural_terrain: "Our Natural Terrain"
 our_natural_terrain_desc: "The terrain of Baglana is not forgiving to those who are new to it. Mountains and valleys and fertile plains all scattered about in Baglana, and we know how to best use them in a defensive strategy as well as navigate them for troop movements. Others who might invade us know very little of these routes we take and as such we will take advantage of this."
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates: "Pirates? With Baglana?"
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates_desc: "With how scattered some of our cities and communities are, it should come as no surprise that those of Baglana have shady connections all around, especially with raiders and pirates. The western coast has been a haven for us in this regard and we are willing to make these contracts with pirates and raiders into something more formal so that all of Baglana can benefit."
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja: "Rein in the Chiefs of Baglana"
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja_desc: "The myriad of chiefs throughout Baglana are capable of causing issues at times with the central government, and the Raja is not always able to calm them down through peaceful means. There must be expeditions sent out to formally subjugate and bring these chiefs underneath the flag of Baglana so that they do not stir up trouble beneath the Raja or in the communities that are loyal to the Raja."
 rivals_in_khandesh: "Rivals in Khandesh"
 rivals_in_khandesh_desc: "Khandesh has been a staunch rival of ours for decades now, being one to launch attacks against us and the Gujarati people to our northwest. They think they can easily come through Baglana and tear down what we've worked on for so long, but they couldn't be more wrong. The people of Baglana are ready and willing to take up arms at every point against these invaders and Khandesh will be the first to know this."
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana: "Reshaping the Military of Baglana"
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana_desc: "By now we have noticed the faults in the army of Baglana, one of which is the fact that payment and service is not nearly as formal as it should be. If we can organize military matters into something centralized and cohesive, we'll benefit from a better quality army that can do more work than a simple levy-based army of irregularly trained soldiers."

 the_prices_of_being_on_the_border: "Being on the Border"
 the_prices_of_being_on_the_border_desc: "The border region in which we inhabit has been crossed by a great many people before the sultans of Multan came around. We are accustom to this occasional passing of people and have even been successful in garnering some of these people to settle in the lands of Multan. With an influx of population, they will be good to use as soldiers when Multan needs them since warfare is inherent to our position... After we integrate them into society, of course."
 great_center_of_trade: "Great Center of Trade"
 great_center_of_trade_desc: "Past travellers have written about Multan and what they write is nothing short of the truth: that Multan is a grand center of trade along the Indus River. We readily embrace this fact and try to stimulate trade as best we can so that our revenue streams can increase as time goes on."
 friends_of_the_baloch: "Friends of the Baloch"
 friends_of_the_baloch_desc: "Few talk of the people of the Baloch for some reason or another; perhaps it is because they are seen as tribal and unworthy? We don't know for sure, but what we do know is that our citizens have made great friends in the people of the Baloch and many mercenary contracts are coming through to Multan from the region because of this. Why not cement this friendship further and accept the mercenaries into our fold?"
 repulse_delhi_and_afghan_invasions: "Repulse the Invaders"
 repulse_delhi_and_afghan_invasions_desc: "Pashtun and Hindustani troops alike are keen on taking over Multan at all times, whether by diplomacy or by conquest, neither of which we will readily allow happen. The armies of Multan must resist foreign incursion and fight to preserve what was once a divided land that is now united as one!"

 sufis_of_multan_desc: "As is the case with other places in Hindustan, several sufis can be found throughout Multan doing work to promote Islam whilst also working to understand and connect with Hindus from every part of society. It is our duty to not only embrace these sufis but to also promote them as the work they do for Multan is crucial both on a societal level and an administrative level."

 from_frontier_land_to_heart_land_desc: "The lands of Multan have changed over the decades and centuries, whether it be in layout of cities, the ways of the culture present within it, or even the religious traditions present within the people living here. They are no longer a frontier land that is simply on the edge of an empire or kingdom of some sort, no, they are now a heartland to a vibrant and prosperous people. We must let none take this away from the Multani people, making this land once again a mere frontier domain."

 inter_disciplinary_standards_desc: "Across the Channel on both sides, the standards for military service may have been different in some senses, but they were also similar in other regards.

 subjects_of_the_crowns: "Subjects of the Crowns"
 subjects_of_the_crowns_desc: "When Henry II was around to claim a majority of what is considered Angevin, there were several subject feudatories that held the realm together. Though we are more centralized now, we still rely on subject states here and there and as such should be ready to keep these subjects in line and loyal to the unified crown, whether by English or French means."
 english_channel_control: "Channel Control"
 english_channel_control_desc: "The heart of trade for us is quite obvious: the English Channel. It's a haven for trade and very profitable for us, and along with that, it has given us ample opportunity to refine our naval efforts and tactics, as well as giving us a safe gateway to the west and the the east. It's our natural duty to ensure that our power propagates out from the English Channel and never fades from it."
 fertility_of_french_land: "Fertility of French Land"
 fertility_of_french_land_desc: "With the extremely fertile lands of France under our control, we can reform the agricultural practices over time and ensure an ample supply of food (as well as other resources) for our people. It might take some time to do, but it will be more than worth it in the end when the military and citizens of the Angevin Realm are well fed and prosperous."
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres: "Interlocked Administrative Cadres"
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc: "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles.

 industrialization_measures_desc: "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential. It may be foolish of us to rush into this new age, but the benefits of its industrial techniques and new technologies are simply too good to pass up. Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."

 malla_kings_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our lineage of rulers are known as the 'Malla Kings' and their lineage stretches all the way back toward a little before the 8th century. Such a long and strong line of succession makes Bishnupur ingrained in the people it rules over; the people have faith in the royal lineage and know it well enough to have a good amount of trust in the ones who have ruled over Mallabhum for so long."
 the_isolation_of_bishnupur: "The Isolation of Bishnupur"
 the_isolation_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our homeland is quite isolated from other communities and states and rarely do people come through our lands to invade or even trade. This isolation isn't completely bad for Bishnupur since it has allowed us to cultivate a grand defensive mentality and structure that few can match."

 praying_to_bipodtarini_devi_desc: "Our kings are often associated with Bipodtarini Devi, who is considered one of the 108 avatars of the goddess Durga. She is closely linked with the concept of overcoming troubles and often prayed to for this, and thus as our kings are associated with this, they too should be looked up to in order to help overcome struggles, thus in part promoting the relation with Bipodtarini Devi."

 abiding_by_the_mallabda_calendar_desc: "We have developed a unique calendar in Bishnupur that is unlike most others (though somewhat related to other Bengali calendars).

 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen_desc: "We would not be a true Somali Sultanate if we did not bolster our naval force to some degree. The time has finally come to invest in our sailors and ships so that they do not falter when on the high seas when trading or when in combat against rival navies."
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen: "Centralized Authority in Majeerteen"
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen_desc: "By reforming the authority within Majeerteen over time and putting an emphasis on bureaucracy over tribal politics, we will see a less unrest within the sultanate as well as increased influence in local politics. We'd rather have ourselves influencing the people of Majeerteen as opposed to possible insurgents hidden within the local chiefs."
 establish_a_modern_sultanate: "Establish a Modern Sultanate"
 establish_a_modern_sultanate_desc: "With changing times comes changing technologies and ways of thought. It is not enough to follow Islamic law all the time and become hardline in our thinking; we must open up to new ways of thought that some scholars may put forth in both educational and religious settings."
 establish_the_majeerteen_military: "Establish the Majeerteen Military"
 establish_the_majeerteen_military_desc: "The military of Majeerteen has never been anything that stands out in comparison to other Somali states, but we know this cannot last. Naval warfare is important, but taking land that is away from the coast is also very important and a strong military will be needed for that. Let us take the first steps in establishing a centralized and cogent military force that Majeerteen can use for both offensive and defensive purposes."

 sufi_shrines_rebuilt_desc: "Nagaur has been the home to sufi shrines for many decades now, but several were destroyed in the 14th century to various invasions and conflicts.

 memory_of_the_mongol_invasions_desc: "Within the memory of Nagaur is that of the Mongol invasions and what they did to the political as well as military landscape of the subcontinent. We must not let the bad parts of what they did weigh us down, but rather we must embrace the tactics they used that were so effective at dismantling northern powers, chief among them were based around cavalry."
 alliances_against_mewar: "Alliances against Mewar"
 alliances_against_mewar_desc: "Mewar has been something of a thorn in our side, but also a beneficial power to Nagaur at other times. The Rajputs are not to be underestimated at all, but we must also remember that they too will want to take over us. Let us form an alliance network to effectively ensure the destruction of Mewar and after them, the others who will still try to threaten Nagaur."

 rajput_warriors_with_turks_desc: "Turkic Mongols that fought against us decades before along with Rajputs that fought us more recently are hardly without their uses.

 against_the_sayyids_of_delhi_desc: "The rulers of Delhi have often sought to influence and take control over Nagaur in some way or form since we are partially of Islamic origin, but their efforts shall forever be in vain. Those Nagaur will triumph over Delhi, especially the Sayyids, whether by underhanded tactics or overt and factual claims on their land."
 fortify_naguar_fort_and_others: "Fortify Nagaur"
 fortify_naguar_fort_and_others_desc: "It is no secret that our land is need of defenses, but as to how and where we will build these defenses is another question. Perhaps if we can focus our efforts on defense a bit more we can ensure that those of Nagaur are safer and that the land we rest upon is made less vulnerable to the devastation caused by invading armies."

 enemies_in_the_huron_iroquois_desc: "Traditionals enemies as they may be, the Huron and Iroquois have a powerful influence on the lands around us. We must keep our knowledge of warfare we have engaged in against both powers close to us so that we do not lose our grasp on militancy or our warrior spirit. They may seek to strike us because we are smaller than them, but they will know just how strong we can be in the heat of battle."
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs: "War and Civil Chiefs"
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs_desc: "There is a distinction between what chiefs handle war-time affairs and peace-time affairs. We keep this order in place so as to maintain a stable realm for our people; refining this two-chief dynamic as we go on in time will only lead to us being governed better and more efficiently."
 steady_expansion_of_lands: "Steady Expansion of Lands"
 steady_expansion_of_lands_desc: "We take some lessons from the Huron and Iroquois in military traditions, but we must also look at how they have handled a growing population and various growing communities, and then look at how we are handling our own. Is it enough to keep going throughout the ages migrating over and over again? Perhaps not... Perhaps it is time we accept this expansion of our domain and land and settle down for good."
 improving_fighting_styles: "Improving our Fighting Style"
 improving_fighting_styles_desc: "With new ages come new ways of fighting and Meskwaki and Sauk people know this for a fact. Adatping our warriors to at least some of these new ways of fighting will be key to our survival and prosperity; there is no peace and happiness without shedding blood and tears, is there?"

 population_upswing_desc: "Do we not take to the new ages well? Our progress seems to say we do, what with our growing population and expanding communities, we are at a place we could never have dreamed about just a few generations ago.

 refine_the_traditions_of_succession_desc: "One key piece of law and tradition that we must always answer to is succession. How it is handled may have been more complex in the past, but people want change and refinement of the system of succession. If we can compromise with the citizens on a few matters, we can at least make both sides somewhat happy and maybe even clear out some outdated traditions as well."

 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi: "Turbulent Past of Kalahandi"
 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi_desc: "Kalahandi itself has been through a great amount of power shifts between rulers and those who adhere close by to the ruler. The dynamics of these shifts aren't always clear, but the military is always involved in some form. By ensuring that the military is at least curtailed and not capable of seizing all power in Kalahandi, but is actually integrated properly within the state itself, we can organize it in a much better fashion."
 rising_power_of_the_nagas: "Rising Power of the Nagas"
 rising_power_of_the_nagas_desc: "The nagas should never be underestimated. The nagas survived the ancient extermination attempt by Janamejaya, the Kuru king from so long ago, and now they are resurgent today. None will be able to stop the nagas grand rise to prominence in the wake of other powers around us! Let us take back what glory is rightfull ours!"

 adoption_of_new_strategies_from_orissa_desc: "We are entering new times that bring with them interesting new ways of fighting.

 solidify_kalahandi: "Soldify Kalahandi"
 solidify_kalahandi_desc: "On the larger scale of things, Kalahandi is still a disorganized entity with decentralized power being rife throughout, not unlike the history of the land in prior centuries. It might not be easy to do, but attempting to centralize power and to uphold the authority of Kalahandi over chiefs and local leaders may do us more good than we currently anticipate."

Once a great site for trade and agriculture, now it has fallen into disrepair, but there is hope still that it can come back and become like it use to be. The practices we used to build up Old Kaskaskia Village we will never forget as we trudge on into the future."
 the_cahokia_tribe: "The Cahokia Tribe"
 the_cahokia_tribe_desc: "What the Cahokia brought with them to the confederation were 5 chiefs that helped in matters of governance, something that is very much needed when presiding over such a large amount of people groups. By keeping them as they were and slowly evolving the positions they are in, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for ourselves."
 the_peiora_tribe: "The Peiora Tribe"
 the_peiora_tribe_desc: "The Peiora tribe is one that united with several others and brought a sense of unity to the confederacy.

 legacy_of_the_13_tribes_desc: "The 13 tribes in total that we encompass within the confederacy will need room to expand in time. Let us go forth an prepare these lands for them to settle in, for they will sow seeds of prosperity and reap the rewards for the wider confederation later on. The other people outside our borders, they cannot do as we do in this sense; they will only spoil the land."
 the_tamaroa_tribe: "The Tamaroa Tribe"
 the_tamaroa_tribe_desc: "The Tamaroa tribe has worked to fight off other neighboring tribes time and time again, and their work inspires the warriors of the confederacy. They will be integral to the survival of our confederacy and we should not take them for granted, for, if we cannot fight our enemies properly, we will become their subjects in time."
 assimilating_other_tribes: "Assimilating Others"
 assimilating_other_tribes_desc: "By now we have become masters at assimilating other groups of people into our greater confederacy. It should not be a surprise that we can continue to attract these people into our fold and integrate them without much of a hassle, it's simply part of being the Illinois Confederacy."
 the_illinois_confederacy: "The Illinois Confederacy"
 the_illinois_confederacy_desc: "Formalizing the entrance into the Illinois Confederacy is what our main focus is currently. Whether by conquest or by peaceful annexation, we will need to make sure that people are welcomed warmly into our fold and that they are accepted for who they are.

There are few who know this outside of Bastar, but as we rise in prominence, it will become central to our foundational canon and we shall not be losing the favor of Danteshwari anytime soon."
 link_to_the_telugus: "Link to the Kakatiya Dynasty"
 link_to_the_telugus_desc: "Though some would dispute this claim, we assert that our founder was actually the brother of the last ruler of the Kakatiya Dynasty (Prataparudra, reign: 1289-1323). We can use this connection to one of the great Telugu dynasties south of us to better enhance our connections around us and in time, build up our successive dynasty like the Kakatiya Dynasty itself."
 keep_bastar_unified: "Keep Bastar Unified"
 keep_bastar_unified_desc: "There is subtle trouble that brews beneath the surface of Bastar, that being the question of succession upon the death of our ruler. Some would prop up a different son or daughter from the chosen heir and attempt to split off from Bastar, but we will take measures to ensure that this does not happen. Central authority will be paramount within our borders and within our court."
 succeed_the_kakatiya_dynasty: "Succeed the Kakatiya Dynasty"
 succeed_the_kakatiya_dynasty_desc: "Their kingdom died out due to the invasions of the Delhi Sultanate, but we live on after them as a successor state if sorts.

 established_in_the_first_century_desc: "The nagas date back several centuries, from before states like 'Bahmanis' or 'Jaunpur' were ever even thought about.

 myths_of_the_naga_dynasty_origins_desc: "The legendary epics of old that are still rife within the communities of Jharkhand tell of the nagas as well as other heroes and villains, gods and goddesses alike, tales that have been passed down for generations.

 empower_the_kshatriya_varna_desc: "Our upper class, the ruling class, that is, of Jharkhand, is made up of the Kshatriya Varna. For too long they have been tied down by petty political matters and tribal feuds that get in the way of good governance in conjunction with good leadership in military matters.

 feudatory_mandala_traditions: "Feudatory Mandala Traditions"
 feudatory_mandala_traditions_desc: "With how political matters go in and around Ratanpur, feudatories and mandalas are of no issue to us. Having more of them and having them be loyal to us is a sign of greatness, prestige, and power to many and by ensuring that ours (whether they be governed by family or not) are not rebellious, we can propagate our influence outward."
 defend_the_land_of_ratnapura: "Defending Ratanpur"
 defend_the_land_of_ratnapura_desc: "What we've built up over the decades must never be given to the enemy, not without the fiercest of fights we can give. Defensive positions and keeping our structures safe is of the utmost priority and keeping the fortifications we need in peak condition is also key to us."
 ratnapura_coinage_reform: "Coinage Reform"
 ratnapura_coinage_reform_desc: "Though some don't think much of it, we of Ratanpur do take the time and effort to overhaul our coinage every now and again.

 finances_of_the_court_in_ratnapura_desc: "With coinage relatively sorted out for ourselves, the matter of finances is the obvious next subject that must be addressed afterwards.

 feudatory_of_the_gajapati_kingdom_desc: "The great Gajapati Kingdom casts a large shadow over us and other rulers that are away from the coast. The fact that we are related to the the great kingdom gives us a higher place amongst the many feudatories and with this in mind, we can garner more support for developing our own land into something great."
 garjati_oriya_connection: "Garjati-Oriya Relations"
 garjati_oriya_connection_desc: "We are essentially the bridge between the Garjati and Oriya people, what with where we are situated geographically. By being the ones to bridge these gaps between the two cultures and perhaps even more in the future, we can ensure a more stable state for ourselves."
 garjati_fortress_control: "Fortress Control"
 garjati_fortress_control_desc: "The lands of the Garjati people are filled with scattered fortifications that are often under the control of semi-independent tribal chiefs. Subjugating them formally and reining them into the central authority of our state will ensure that we can maintain more forts for less cost, and in time, build up a better model for maintaining fortifications overall."
 garjati_adaptive_warfare: "Adaptive Warfare"
 garjati_adaptive_warfare_desc: "The tropical climate of the Garjati homes are not home to the most stable fighting grounds. Often there are uneven hills, sudden ridges, dense jungles, and uncultivated areas that make warfare much more small-scale and scattered. By adapting our strategy to not only this terrain, but whatever terrain we find ourselves on, we can make the fight for enemies even worse and the fight for us even more advantageous."
 the_meaning_of_gajapati: "The Meaning of 'Gajapati'"
 the_meaning_of_gajapati_desc: "In Odia, Gajapati means 'king with an army of elephants'. Few are willing to take this claim seriously due to our relatively small powerbase, but once we expand and field elephants on a grand scale, modernizing them at the same time, our enemies will know the true meaning behind our name."
 continue_architectual_work: "Continue Architectual Work"
 continue_architectual_work_desc: "We may take lesseson from the Gajapati Kingdom in several ways, but we are still keen on developing our own standards for certain things, one of which being architecture.

 remember_the_work_of_ramai_deva_desc: "Ramai Deva, our Rajput founder, was the one who took down the previous unstable authority of oligarchs in the region and enthroned himself into the seat of power, creating a strong and stable foundation for a lasting dynastic state. We must not falter in our efforts to emulate his work; stability and cohesion in our society are going to be crucial if we of Patna are ever going to expand outward and have our people prosper."
 enforcing_authority_in_patna: "Enforcing Authority in Patna"
 enforcing_authority_in_patna_desc: "The authority within Patna can sometimes be weak and without much force behind it due to networks of communication being relatively slow.

 revive_the_military_prowess_from_ramai_deva_desc: "The disciplined state Ramai Deva created in his time must not be forgotten, especially in the vein of our military.

 solidify_the_eastern_ganga_domain_desc: "What was here before Patna? The Eastern Ganga Dynasty (sometimes called the Imperial Gangas). They were one of the few who were able to hold out against the likes of the Delhi Sultanate and its ruthless conquests, but alas, the glory of the Eastern Gangas did not last.

 cultivation_of_keonjhar: "Cultivation of Keonjhar"
 cultivation_of_keonjhar_desc: "There is a need for us to build up the central structure of Keonjhar beyond just a petty village. A place where a grand court can be built and where the citizens can walk around with pride in their heart and soul, that is what Keonjhar will be; it all starts with us being willing to invest in the development of the rugged terrain."

 to_be_a_raja_and_beyond_desc: "Some see us a petty chiefdom, but we are so much more than that. Our ruler, the raja, needs to become smart and skillful in all areas of life, but he also needs to be strong in his will to have an up-right and astute court backing him, otherwise he has no power. If this can be satisfied, then perhaps our raja can become more than what he currently is."

 coming_together_of_various_traditions_desc: "Just as past powers came for Jeypore, various cultures left their mark too and even today we experience a vast amount of varied cultural influence.

 reform_the_dynastic_succession_desc: "To us the way of succession in Jeypore is often messy and chaotic and often times it leads to issues regarding power and money.

 plentiful_mercenary_contracts_desc: "With the acceptance of various cultures comes the arrival of various warriors for hire.

 social_cohesion_in_jeypore_desc: "With so many different cultures and traditions floating about Jeypore, there is going to be a need to mediate disputes and feuds between certain groups.

 marinid_hafsid_and_crusade_enemies_desc: "The Marinids, Hafsids, and Iberians are our three principle enemies.

Tlemcen shall not fall, not to the likes of our age-old rivals!"
 corsair_bases: "Corsair Bases"
 corsair_bases_desc: "As with any good North African state, we too use the likes of corsairs to our advantage.

 promote_cultural_unity_of_tlemcen_desc: "There is a key thing missing in Tlemcen that will be the breaking point of us if we are not careful: cultural unity.

It is our duty to ensure this does not happen at any cost."
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries: "Relying on Ourselves"
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries_desc: "Mercenaries are nice at times for when we absolutely are in need of them, but too often we find them more costly than they are worth and wavering in their loyalty toward us.

 jauhar_desc: "This seemingly horrid act is a form self-immolation by Hindu women in particular in order avoid capture, enslavement, and other atrocities that could be committed by hostile forces seeking them out in the midst of certain defeat (that is, defeat on the side of the Hindu women). This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history.

 anti_siege_attacks_desc: "We have since our inception been forced to learn the ways of siege warfare and it isn't easy in the slightest. What we have learned, however, is that sorties and anti-siege attacks from within and from outside fortifications can be extremely useful and it's something we of Jaisalmer should perfect. How and where can we practice? Jaisalmer Fort is a prime target."

 resurgence_of_the_bhati_rajputs_desc: "The time has now come to proclaim a new age for the rajput people. The Bhati Rajputs are no longer the weak subgroup of rajputs as they had been before, but rather they are now one of the top clans around and ready to take up the mantle as leader of Rajasthan.

 rajput_conflicts: "Rajput Conflicts"
 rajput_conflicts_desc: "The rajput are rarely ever truly united on a single cause. Clans will disagree greatly on one matter or another and it's only when there is a common enemy for all rajputs that we have seen unity amongst all clans.

 construction_of_fortifications: "Fortify Jangladesh"
 construction_of_fortifications_desc: "Much like other rajput states, we of Jangladesh are going to need to build fortifications and protective barriers against foreign invaders.

 the_threat_of_bengal_desc: "The Muslim invasions of the 1000s and to 1200s were some of the most frightening times for the traditional Hindu and Jain states of Northern India.

 build_up_the_mel_mandap_desc: "The Mel mandap is the council hall where representatives and other officials meet in order to flesh out the legislation and administration of Kachar.

Let us show them that we will be able to resist such invasions and thwart their attempts at subjugation."
 capital_fortress_town_orchha: "Capital Fortress Town"
 capital_fortress_town_orchha_desc: "To have an open capital ripe for invasion is foolish, is it not?

 tradition_versus_reform_desc: "As influential as our past is, the constant tide of new ideas and technologies is washing over Patiala society without end.

 recover_from_disasters_desc: "When a fire destroys parts of our villages and towns, or storms ruin crops for our people, we need to be sure that the central government of the Susquehannock Confederacy can handle these disasters and not have rampant decentralization occur when these events happen.
