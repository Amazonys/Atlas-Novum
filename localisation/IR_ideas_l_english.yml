 out_on_the_frontier:0 "Frontier Territory"
 out_on_the_frontier_desc:0 "The home of the great Frontier Hero, Texas essentially capitalized its legacy upon ranching and frontier justice. As such, the Texan people will always take risks for the sake of retaining their life on the frontier."
 remember_the_alamo:0 ""Remember the Alamo!""
 remember_the_alamo_desc:0 "The Battle of the Alamo was the battle that was the 'Straw that broke the camel's back' for the Texan populace, causing them to line up for recruitment fanatically. As men like Davy Crockett and James Bowie had died as Martyrs. Leading to the infamous battle-cry that reminded every Texan of the last stand of the bravest men in Texan history."
 irregular_militarism:0 "Irregular Militarism"
 irregular_militarism_desc:0 "The incredible aspect of the Texan Army during the Texas Revolution, was that they were brave enough to stand against a superior force, even with the rifles they've taken off their shelves and their rancher outfits on their backs. The Texans in the army frankly could not give a damn whether or not their army is outgunned and outnumbered, as they fight for what is right on the frontier."
 deep_in_the_heart_of_texas:0 "Deep In The Heart of Texas"
 deep_in_the_heart_of_texas_desc:0 "The starforts at night, are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas"

 texas_ranger_desc:0 "The first men to heed Austin's call-to-arms in 1823, are the Texas Rangers, who would later protect the border of the proposed republic in 1935. As the Texas Rangers serve as the embodiment of the spirit of Frontier Justice in the Republic of Texas."
 memories_of_san_jacinto:0 "Memories of San Jacinto"
 memories_of_san_jacinto_desc:0 "Perhaps the quickest battle of the revolution, the battle showed the world that the Republic of Texas was capable of toppling the Mexican Army and embarassing a larger foe. As the battle had led to the capture of Santa Anna, the President of Mexico and his General Cos. After the two were rounded up, they were pressured into signing a treaty that defined the way that Mexico was to posture after the revolution, beyond the Rio Grande. In which led to the creation of the Republic of Texas"

 AMG_ideas_start:0 "Armagnac Traditions"
 AMG_ideas_bonus:0 "Armagnac Ambition"
 AMG_political_manoeuvres:0 "Political Manoeuvres"
 AMG_political_manoeuvres_desc:0 "Armagnac has long been a nation known for its potential to be unpredictable in its diplomacy. Several times the counts of Armagnac outright defied the authority of the French king, including partaking in large scale rebellions against the house of Valois. These actions have earned us quite the reputation on the diplomatic scene."
 AMG_scattered_territories:0 "Scattered Territories"
 AMG_scattered_territories_desc:0 "Through marriage and purchase of land, the counts of Armagnac were able to expand a once unimportant fief on the borderlands of Gascony to several far-flung counties which stretched from Rodez to Nemours. The task of managing these lands has been a difficult one at times, but with the right administrative policies we can ensure they remain indivisible from our home territory."
 AMG_shifting_alliances:0 "Shifting Alliances"
 AMG_shifting_alliances_desc:0 "Throughout the Late Middle Ages Armagnac kept its precarious position as an independent fief through its clever use of alliances to suit its interests. Even now, these diplomatic strategies will only become more important to ensure the survival of our nation in the future."
 AMG_armagnac_faction:0 "The Armagnac Faction"
 AMG_armagnac_faction_desc:0 "During the time of the Hundred Years' War, the politics within France were dominated by two opposing factions, the Armagnacs and the Burgundians. This rivalry was exacerbated by events such as the assassination of the Armagnac-supporting Duke of Orleans in 1407. Tensions came to a head when the Duchy of Burgundy allied itself with the English, resulting in a bloody civil war. However during these times, the mercenary forces of the Armagnacs in particular showed their prowess on the field, and their tactics still remain with us today."
 AMG_armagnac_brandy:0 "Brandy of Armagnac"
 AMG_armagnac_brandy_desc:0 "Our distilled wine is some of the earliest and most famous to be cultivated in France, and is traded extensively in the region surrounding Auch. Additionally, Dutch merchants have begun to take an interest in the commodity. Let us seize the opportunity to accumulate great wealth from this trade."
 AMG_powerful_dynasty:0 "Powerful Dynasty"
 AMG_powerful_dynasty_desc:0 "Only a few centuries ago was the county of Armagnac at the peak of its power, and being regarded as one of the most powerful entities in Aquitaine. While this glory has largely dissipated since then, we can still be credited as an influential dynasty within the borders of France itself."
 AMG_archbishops_of_aquitaine:0 "Archbishops of Aquitaine"
 AMG_archbishops_of_aquitaine_desc:0 "The capital of the region of Armagnac, Auch, is the seat of the Archdiocese of Auch. It came into existence as early as the 6th century and claimed the prestigious title of archbishops of Aquitaine and Navarre."

 FOI_ideas_start:0 "Foixian Traditions"
 FOI_ideas_bonus:0 "Foixian Ambition"
 FOI_neighbour_connections:0 "Neighbour Connections"
 FOI_neighbour_connections_desc:0 "The neighbouring lands outside of France, such as that of the kingdom of Navarre, have done much to benefit our overall standing. With constant diplomatic interactions with them, we will always be able to count on their support should we need it."
 FOI_vassals_in_name:0 "Vassals Only in Name"
 FOI_vassals_in_name_desc:0 "Unlike the other appanages of France, who have seen themselves aggressively integrated into the \"domaine royal\", we have managed to hold onto our virtual independence in all but name for centuries. This has given us the advantage of being able to expand our army without suspicions of the king."
 FOI_provincial_lords:0 "Provincial Lords"
 FOI_provincial_lords_desc:0 "The county of Foix is divided into several small holdings, each governed by lords who had a say in the government, despite their vassal status. Upholding these Traditions will make our nation much easier to govern."
 FOI_chateau_foix:0 "Chateau de Foix"
 FOI_chateau_foix_desc:0 "The Chateau de Foix lies on the foothills of the Pyrenees, and serves as a point of defence against any enemies seeking to conquer us. However in past years the castle has become somewhat neglected; it is time we realise its importance and upgrade its defences to better withstand a siege."
 FOI_dynastic_expansion:0 "Dynastic Expansion"
 FOI_dynastic_expansion_desc:0 "The county of Foix on its own is not a significant land to hold by any means, but thanks to the ambitious nature and skill of our previous rulers we have managed to enlarge our domains to encompass the viscounties of Bearn and Bigorre. Now that the titles of Bearn and Foix have been ruled together for so long, they have become practically synonymous with each other. Those who may otherwise believe our claims to these lands are false will be much less likely to question our legitimacy to them."
 FOI_mediators_of_war:0 "Mediators of War"
 FOI_mediators_of_war_desc:0 "Foix has seen itself embroiled in many a conflict across the ages, owing to its position on the border between two distinct cultures. Many counts of Foix fought in battles miles from their own land, as well as with local neighbours such as the Armagnacs. This has given us a unique role to play in the region as those who will not hesitate to intervene should tensions spill over."
 FOI_navarrese_influence:0 "Navarrese Influence"
 FOI_navarrese_influence_desc:0 "Foix and Bearn share much of its history with the kingdom of Navarre, as the counts of Foix were able to successfully install their descendants on the Navarrese throne. In fact parts of Bearn lie within the Basque area, which enabled cities such as Pau to prosper from becoming the seat of government of the united Navarre and Foix."

 AUV_ideas:0 "Auvergnat Ideas"
 AUV_ideas_start:0 "Auvergnat Traditions"
 AUV_ideas_bonus:0 "Auvergnat Ambition"
 AUV_massif_central:0 "The Massif Central"
 AUV_massif_central_desc:0 "The Massif Central is an elevated region which covers much of the south of France. In Auvergne however the peaks are at their highest, making it extremely difficult for an enemy to traverse it."
 AUV_heart_of_southern_france:0 "The Heart of Southern France"
 AUV_heart_of_southern_france_desc:0 "Despite Auvergne's vast hills, agriculture dominates the economy of the region and we are renowned for our farming practices. Being barely affected by the Hundred Years' War has allowed us to harbour a flourishing economy, whereas other regions of France may not be quite the same after the ravages of English occupation."
 AUV_reform_succession_law:0 "Reform Succession Law"
 AUV_reform_succession_law_desc:0 "The territory of Auvergne historically had three components the County, the Duchy and the Dauphinate. This has made our legitimacy prone to being questioned, as other royal houses could intermarry with our dependents and inherit any of the three titles. If we want to guarantee our independence, we must reform our succession law and rid ourselves of any foreign influence."
 AUV_auvergnat_identity:0 "Auvergnat Identity"
 AUV_auvergnat_identity_desc:0 "While many might think of us as equals with that of the Occitan people, we in fact are much different. Auvergnat is a major dialect of the Occitan language which is spoken widely by our people; this is the fact which allows us to reinforce our claims to national sovereignty."
 AUV_blood_of_arverni:0 "Blood of the Arverni"
 AUV_blood_of_arverni_desc:0 "The land of Auvergne was once inhabited by the Arverni, a Gallic tribe which eventually fell under control of the Roman Empire, as did the rest of Gaul. However, a great chieftain named Vercingetorix led a grand resistance against the occupation. Though the Arverni were eventually subjugated again, the bravery and blood of our ancestors still flow through us."
 AUV_frankish_roots:0 "Frankish Roots"
 AUV_frankish_roots_desc:0  "Auvergne was one of the earliest states within the borders of France to have come to existence, and since the time of the Carolingians a long line of counts and dukes have ruled the land in succession. This is a feat which very few states like us have managed to accomplish."
 AUV_end_clermont_rivalry:0 "End the Clermont Rivalry"
 AUV_end_clermont_rivalry_desc:0 "Ever since the Middle Ages there has been enmity between the counts of Auvergne and the bishops around the area of Clermont. In order to place limits on the clergy's power in the area the counts founded the city of Montferrand, however this has only served to further intensify the problems of centuries ago. In order to end the rivalry once and for all we should merge the two cities. This would increase Clermont's economic output greatly while also benefitting the clergy."
 
 BOU_ideas:0 "Bourbon Ideas"
 BOU_ideas_start:0 "Bourbon Traditions"
 BOU_ideas_bonus:0 "Bourbon Ambition"
 BOU_castle_montlucon:0 "Castle of Montluçon"
 BOU_castle_montlucon_desc:0 "Montluçon Castle dates back to 1070, when it was a small outpost first built by the seigneur of Bourbon. Over the centuries it gradually transformed into a major castle, its development spurred on by the Hundred Years' War. Now it is a sign of our wealth and power and will significantly hamper any invasion of our lands."
 BOU_loyal_nation:0 "A Loyal Nation"
 BOU_loyal_nation_desc:0 "Traditionally the house of Bourbon was loyal to the kings of France, and often lent their forces to the royal domain in times of need. This has been beneficial to us in many ways, since the kings granted Bourbon many privileges in exchange for their help. The most major of which was the elevation of our territory to the status of a duchy in 1327, greatly increasing our prestige and prosperity."
 BOU_bordering_cultures:0 "Bordering Cultures"
 BOU_bordering_cultures_desc:0 "The province of Bourbon sits at the crossroads between the distinct Langue d'oil and the Lenga d'oc. While we have generally favoured the influence of the northern dialects in the past, our heritage is closely linked with that of Occitania. Let us cherish this relationship by making our land as much renowned for the Occitan people as the French."
 BOU_natural_borders:0 "Natural Borders"
 BOU_natural_borders_desc:0 "From the towering hills of the Massif Central in the south to the Loire flowing in the east, our geographical position is well-placed in the centre of France to guard much of our borders from attack. While foreign enemies may be faced with a completely unknown territory, our armies have extensive knowledge of the terrain and thus can defend themselves better during combat."
 BOU_dynastic_claims:0 "Dynastic Claims"
 BOU_dynastic_claims_desc:0 "Because of the prominence that Bourbon dukes achieved in the French court, they were given various territories as appanages, assisting in the expansion of Bourbon power. While the ownership of these counties changed as dynasties fell and others rose, we still have sufficient grounds to grow a power base outside of our heartland by seizing advantage of our claims to them."
 BOU_cadet_houses_of_bourbon:0 "Cadet Houses of Bourbon"
 BOU_cadet_houses_of_bourbon_desc:0 "Due to the complex nature of feudal politics, the house of Bourbon is also subdivided into several cadet branches, such as the lines of Bourbon-Montpensier and Condé. Some of these noble families are powerful and have a major influence in French affairs."
 BOU_bourbon_kings:0 "Bourbon Kings"
 BOU_bourbon_kings_desc:0 "Historically the house of Bourbon was one of the largest and most prestigious houses in early modern Europe, providing the kings for France and Spain by the 18th century. However, it cannot be forgotten that the house has its origins in Bourbonnais itself, and our name is widely known among ruling classes as a result of this."

 wls_marches_idea_2:0 "Appointed by England"
 wls_marches_idea_2_desc:0 "The land conquered from the native Welsh petty kings has been organized into Earldoms, with each Earl invested by the King of England into a hereditary position. With the backing of the most powerful force in the British Isles, we too can dominate the political landscape of these strange Celtic lands."
 wls_marches_idea_3:0 "Sicut Regale Rulers"
 wls_marches_idea_3_desc:0 "Compared to normal English fiefs, we have extensive freedoms. Royal Writ does not apply in our frontier holdings, and we instead rule 'sicut regale' - 'ling a king'.

 wls_marches_idea_4:0 "Roger Mortimer"
 wls_marches_idea_4_desc:0 "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding exensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful, he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of the English King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrestle back control of his kingdom from Mortimer, and had him executed, sparing his mother's life. Ironic - he could save others from death, but not himself."
 wls_marches_idea_5:0 "Foreign Settlers"
 wls_marches_idea_5_desc:0 "It was not just the Anglo-Normans who conquered and settled South Wales. Many invested Earls were brought directly from mainland France, but also from Brittany and Flanders.

 wls_marches_idea_6:0 "Geoffrey of Monmouth"
 wls_marches_idea_6_desc:0 "He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past.

 wls_marches_idea_7_desc:0 "Edward IV needed to properly administer Wales even long after his eponymous ancestor's conquests.

 EPI_ideas_start:0 "Epirote Traditions"
 EPI_ideas_bonus:0 "Epirote Ambitions"
 EPI_idea_1:0 "Pyrrhos"
 EPI_idea_1_desc:0 "In the third century BC, a Molossian king called Pyrrhos ascended to the kingship of Epirus and led it to great victories. He made the Epirote state so strong it rivaled Rome itself, leading multiple attacks against this rival republic. He is remembered in the term 'Pyrrhic Victory', which denotes a win at great cost - the type of win Epirus will always be willing to achieve when necessary."
 EPI_idea_2:0 "Empire of the Angeloi"
 EPI_idea_2_desc:0 "When Constantinople fell in 1204, not all of the Byzantine Empire's lands were conquered by the Latins. The three main areas remaining under Greek control - Epirus, Nikaea, and Trebizond - each declared themselves the legitimate successors to the defunct state. It is only our Angelid 'Komnenos-Doukas' dynasty that has an actual legitimate claim, from Isaac in 1185 all the way up to the murdered Alexios Mourtzouphlos. We will avenge Mourtzouphlos and restore the Empire's rightful heirs!"
 EPI_idea_3:0 "The Second Noah"
 EPI_idea_3_desc:0 "Many displaced Greeks from around the Aegean have been welcomed to the benevolent realm of Epirus over the years. Our founder was even described as a 'Second Noah', taking in refugees from the Latin flood. Though Latins eventually held their own influence in Epirus, this open embracement of new citizens has remained."
 EPI_idea_4:0 "Arvanites"
 EPI_idea_4_desc:0 "Arvanites were a type of Hellenized Albanians who first lived around Himara and Argyrokastro before migrating to Thebes and Attica. Since the Serbian Empire, Albanians established their own states in the Epirote region, holding court at such cities as Arta. These Albanians were known for their ferocity, mercilessly attacking Greeks, Latins, and Turks alike."
 EPI_idea_5:0 "The Last Franks"
 EPI_idea_5_desc:0 "The port of Vonitsa was finally lost to the Turks in 1479 after decades of clinging on. With its fall, the last remnants of the Frankokratia established over 250 years earlier were finally erased, barring a handful of Venetian ports. We were first among Greeks, and last among Latins."
 EPI_idea_6:0 "Ionian Islands"
 EPI_idea_6_desc:0 "As the lords of the Ionian coast, we have extensive connections to the islands of Cephalonia, Zakynthos, and Kerkyra, and command trade between mainland Greece and southern Italy around the Strait of Otranto. The influence of Epirus over these islands was so great their Orsini lords converted to Orthodoxy and adopted Greek customs to appeal to us."
 EPI_idea_7:0 "Souliote Revolutions"
 EPI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Souliotes inspired some of the fiercest revolutions against Ottoman rule in Greek history, such as the 1685 Himaran revolt and the mid-1700s Ottoman subjugation attempts in which army after army were destroyed. Their 1770 Orlov revolt presaged the Greek War of Independence, and even after the nation had won its freedom, the Epirote people revolted one final time in 1854."

Although we're sure that our arms won't fail us, it will be imposible to stand alone in the face of ever increasing threats. We must use our ties among Hanseantic city-states and exploit the conflicts and divisions between surrounding enemies to create a more universal diplomatic policy and acquire our independence for a prolonged time."

 DTT_idea_2_desc:0 "Many knights, nobles, and kings have treated our militia with disrespect and disdain, only to gravely regret their mistake, facing humiliating defeat. Living and toiling in marshy terrain is what made us tough, organised, and self-reliant. However, with a new age of warfare, simply being organised won't do.

 LIE_idea_3:0 "Bonnes Villes"
 LIE_idea_3_desc:0 "Those cities that were of greatest importance in the realm were called 'Good Cities'.

 LIE_idea_4:0 "Perron"
 LIE_idea_4_desc:0 "In addition to previously mentioned privileges, each Bonne Ville could erect a stone column on their town square with a globus cruciger atop of it, caller the Perron. Such a monument symbolises autonomy and freedom, both of the Prince-Bishopric and of the Good Cities. Represented on our coat of arms, standards and bagdes, it reminds each of our citizens that the state they live in is an oasis surrounded by nests of tyranny and malevolence, and their undeniable rights are guaranteed by the supreme authority of the Prince-Bishop, coming from God himself."
 LIE_idea_5:0 "Liegian Renaissance"
 LIE_idea_5_desc:0 "Under the benevolent rule of prince-bishop Erard de la Marck, finances of the state were restored and the city returned to its former glory. Also, many deposits of blue limestone and marble supported architectural development in Liège, resulting in the easily recognisable style of the Mosan renaissance.

 LIE_idea_7:0 "Liegian Revolution"
 LIE_idea_7_desc:0 "The sudden switch from an enlightened to an authoritarian Prince-Bishop has led to unrest so large that when the French Revolution began, almost immediately a Liegian Revolution broke out.

With such a system we can handle an empire with multiple vulnerable fronts."

 STY_idea_1_desc:0 "When in 1276 Styrian and Carinthian nobles swore an oath to emperor Rudolf I. of Habsburg at the abbey of Rein close to Graz, the century lasting reign of the Habsburgs in Styria and the rest of Austria began. If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed legitimising our sovereignity."
 STY_idea_2:0 "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc:0 "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these man will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3:0 "Rezeß von Wien"
 STY_idea_3_desc:0 "For a long time, there were excalves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers. From now on we will be the worldly sovereign being able to tax and raise troops in these regions. However, these territories will still belong to their lordships, and they will still be responsible for all judicial matters."
 STY_idea_4:0 "Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat"
 STY_idea_4_desc:0 "Various raids have shown that we need to centralize our defenses in order to react properly. We will found the Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat in which we will convene and counsel with our territorial estates close to the border. This will help to decide with as much information as possible, so that our defensive actions will be more organised."
 STY_idea_5:0 "Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft"

As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magddeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_2:0 "Bread House of the Hansa"
 MAG_idea_2_desc:0 "Beginning from the 13th century, Magdeburg was part of the Hansa and a pivotal centre of trade at the Elbe. Also because of the staple right for corn, Magdeburg monopolised the corn trade making it the 'Bread House of the Hansa'."
 MAG_idea_3:0 "Unseres Herrgotts Kanzlei"
 MAG_idea_3_desc:0 "After the adoption of a more evangelical approach to christianity, we have fought with verve to protect these new teachings have refused to make any concessions even under military pressure.

 MAG_idea_4:0 "Forerunning Primas Germaniae"
 MAG_idea_4_desc:0 "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986. Although, there are others holding this title, too, we are the only ones to have adopted the new religious teachings. Therefore, we should use our title to become the forefront of this movement and impose our supremacy!"
 MAG_idea_5:0 "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc:0 "Our land and city was completly devastated during the so called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgisation for such a terror. But if we now gave up and dissuaded from the right path, they would ultimately win. Therefore, we will rebuild our city and land to even excell our former glory!"
 MAG_idea_6:0 "Magdeburg Hemispheres"
 MAG_idea_6_desc:0 "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publically accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space inbetween with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."

 MAI_idea_1_desc:0 "The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was also the Archchansellor of Germany (the others being over Burgundy and Italy), and was as such ranked first among all the ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, and was second only to the Emperor.\nIt served a considerable role as intermediary between the estates of the Empire. It's the Archbishop of Mainz who calls the electors together for an election, who accepts the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_2:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 MAI_idea_2_desc:0 "The Primas Germaniae was a historical title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic Bishop in the German lands. Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3:0 "Large Military Household"
 MAI_idea_3_desc:0 "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany. For the Indiculus Loricatorum, a reinforcement consisting of heavy knights requested by Otto II for his campaign in Italy, Mainz gave one of the highest number of cavalrymen, even if they had already sent many. However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severly declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4:0 "Old Roman Road Network"
 MAI_idea_4_desc:0 "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5:0 "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc:0 "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6:0 "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc:0 "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict. This war had ravaged the Mainzer lands and caused the end of the existence of the Imperial City of Mainz. The Bishop appointed by the Pope had won the war."
 MAI_idea_7:0 "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to becoem the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, seeked and managed to gain more power."

 SLZ_idea_5_desc:0 "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 persons left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Würtemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."
