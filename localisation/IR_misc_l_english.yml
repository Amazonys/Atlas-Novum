 #bt_trade_good_beerDESC:0 "Beer and other cereal alcohols such as whisky or rice wine have been produced for many thousands of years all around the world and represent a significant part of the daily diet for most cultures. While sometimes disdained in favor of wine or fruit-based alcohols in warmer climes, it is often cheaper, faster, and easier to produce, especially in regions where grapes cannot be easily cultivated."

 ir_whales:0 "Whales"
 ir_whalesDESC:0 "Since as early as the 9th century, humans have been hunting whales for their meat and blubber, which is useful for making oils. By the Early Modern period, significant fishing communities increasingly relied on whaling as a lucrative source of income, which only continued to grow with the advent of the Industrial Revolutions."
 ir_rice:0 "Rice"
 ir_riceDESC:0 "A cereal grain most commonly found in Asia, Rice has been cultivated since time immemorial. For a significant part of the Early Modern period, Rice remained the top produced crop due to its style of cultivation. Rice paddies, irrigated fields submerged in water, act as an in-built anti-pest system, making it the crop of choice for the large population centers of East Asia and beyond."
 ir_silver:0 "Silver"
 ir_silverDESC:0 "Like Gold, Silver has been used as a standard of value over the ages for its precious qualities. Early into the Renaissance, shortages of Gold in Europe led to the opening of many silver mines across Lower Germany and the Balkans. Furthermore, with the discovery of the New World, Silver rapidly became a currency standard, which would have far reaching effects when its export from the Americas was eventually exhausted."
 ir_potatoes:0 "Potatoes"
 ir_potatoesDESC:0 "Known for their hardiness and excellent nutritional value, Potatoes were an American crop cultivated by the Andean peoples. With the trade of goods across the Atlantic, the Potato quickly became the staple of choice amongst Europe poor. Indeed, countries that suffered significant starvation like Ireland and Latvia were able to mitigate it through the widespread circulation of potatoes."
 ir_maize:0 "Maize"
 ir_maizeDESC:0 "Maize was a central crop eaten by a majority of native American groups. With the arrival of the Europeans and its trade around the world, the crop was slowly bred to be more nutritious and flavorful. By the early 21st century, Maize's decendent Corn became the singular crop for feeding any population. Not only would it be used as cattle-feed, but as a hardy staple with a myriad of modern applications as well."
 ir_millet:0 "Millet"
 ir_milletDESC:0 "Significant parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Southern Asia have grown various types of millet as stable crops. While perhaps less known than Wheat, Rice, or Maize, Millet is excellent for tropical climates, and it a rich source of calories in areas already lacking alternatives."
 ir_apiculture:0 "Apiculture"
 ir_apicultureDESC:0 "By slowly domesticating bees and allowing them to build their hives in designated locations, the production of honey was standardized. Not only would it prove to be a sweet alternative to sugar rich in calories, but it was used to produce various meads."
 ir_fruit:0 "Fruit"
 ir_fruitDESC:0 "Fruit in all of its forms have been consumed by humans for as long as can be remembered. Not only are they usually richly flavored and excellent tradegoods, but are good for one's health if consumed."
 ir_olives:0 "Olives"
 ir_olivesDESC:0 "A Mediterranean tree that takes decades to bear fruit, Olives are perhaps one of the most expensive luxury items traded. The Mediterranean has long been the center of Olive production, and the profits from its trade has helped many a nation maintain its economic and strategic stability. Indeed, society progresses when elders plant olive trees which they will never see bear fruit, but their descendents will."
 ir_dates:0 "Dates"
 ir_datesDESC:0 "Though many of the arid regions of the globe are significantly populated, they very dependent on Oases for their water supply and crop production. Dates, a flowering plant species part of the Arecaceae palm family, have been a staple food of the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years. Date production thrived in Oasis environments, as not only a stable food source, but also as a tasty export that foreigners are eager to trade for."
 ir_marble:0 "Marble"
 ir_marbleDESC:0 "Not just any stone, Marble is renowned throughout the globe for its aestetic polish and innate beauty. Due to its crystalline composition, a wide variety of types of marble have played an enormous role in the construction of buildings and statuary throughout history. White marble in particular is prized for its use in sculpture and the creation of masterful marvels of engineering. Due to the rarity in its sites of production, Marble has become the standard building material of opulence the world over."
