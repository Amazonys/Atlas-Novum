 desc_nhs_carthaginian_design_harbour_tm:0 "A revolutionary harbour of classical Carthaginian design featuring multiple rounded Y-shaped enclaves joining up in a large well-guarded central oval, allowing for huge numbers of ships to sail into the heart of the city's newer industrial regions. The seaside half of the central oval serves as a docking point for our military navy and provides excellent infrastructure and protection from the sea to increase the rate of repairs."

 desc_nhs_silk_quarter_tm_decay:0 "This used to be the silk quarter of the Elysian capital, where the Elysian silk was produced in all secrecy and at great efficiency.
