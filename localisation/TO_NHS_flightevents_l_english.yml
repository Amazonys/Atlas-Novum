 nhs_flightevents.1.t:0 "Greek Fire"
 nhs_flightevents.1.d:0 "Hidden in a cache separate from the one detailing how to construct truly ocean-worthy vessels rests a number of manuscripts detailing the construction of siphons and the long-lost formula for Greek Fire, the weapon that saved the Roman Empire on multiple occasions. We could order our alchemists to resume the production of the Liquid Fire and order our smiths to construct siphons we can fit on naval vessels, but every person working on that is one less person aiding in retrofitting our fleet into ocean-going designs."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME1A:0 "Of course we'll divert the resources!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME1B:0 "What use is fire versus gunpowder these days?"
 nhs_flightevents.2.t:0 "Library of Knowledge"
 nhs_flightevents.2.d:0 "We should consider taking copies of our ancient knowledge with us on our travels, they would benefit us greatly and serve to preserve our knowledge and technological progress. Then again, we don't have an infinite amount of space for supplies and settlers..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME2A:0 "Knowledge is power. I like power."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME2B:0 "Food would be nice. I like food."
 nhs_flightevents.3.t:0 "The Silk of Constantinople"
 nhs_flightevents.3.d:0 "Long ago emissaries brought us gifts from faraway lands, including the means to produce silk. We have preserved and protected our monopoly on European silk production ever since. We could consider taking this secret with us and destroying what's left here..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME3A:0 "If nothing else, the secret will die with us."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME3B:0 "What good will expensive clothing do us?"
 nhs_flightevents.11.t:0 "The Genoese Merchants"
 nhs_flightevents.11.d:0 "We should get the most out of our position while we still can. There are two proposals prepared for the doge of Genoa, both offer Genoese ships free passage through the Bosphorus for as long as the current Emperor is in power. We can either ask them for a full payment in gold, or for some of their fine ships... needed to secure the sea routes of course..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME11A:0 "We need the funds."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME11B:0 "We'll need their ships."
 nhs_flightevents.12.t:0 "Venice desires the Peloponnese"
 nhs_flightevents.12.d:0 "We have for long known the Venetians want to expand their holdings in the Aegean. We should consider offering them control over the Peloponnese for a set time -twenty years, in return for a portion of their navy and a one time payment. This might upset our people, and the lords of Athens would feel their position compromised on many flanks, but this deal would be well worth it!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME12A:0 "God knows we need it..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME12B:0 "That's an absurd idea!"
 nhs_flightevents.13.t:0 "Athenian Nobles worried"
 nhs_flightevents.13.d:0 "The nobles of Athens are worried about our recent decisions, they demand compensation of their own in the form of land or gold. Should we pay them off?"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME13A:0 "Give them control over the Peloponnese."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME13B:0 "We can't risk the trouble, pay them off."
 nhs_flightevents.14.t:0 "Granada demands Toll"
 nhs_flightevents.14.d:0 "The ruler of Granada heard of our great expedition approaching and joined up with the Moroccans to intercept and demand toll. Their fleet is still smaller than ours, but we'd have losses in a normal fight... with Greek Fire, this would be an easy fight without losses - it hasn't been seen in a long time. What should we do?"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME14A:0 "Our Greek Fire will make quick work of them!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME14B:0 "Fight through it and suffer some losses."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME14C:0 "Pay their damned toll!"
 nhs_flightevents.15.t:0 "The Portuguese wish to strike a deal"
 nhs_flightevents.15.d:0 "Two Portuguese ships sailed near our fleet today with an envoy. Their leader states that one of the ships and accompanying supplies can be used by us on our travels if we agree to share our discoveries with them. They are under the impression we are heading south to explore the coasts of Africa. One of our advisors suggested that we use this opportunity to trick the nations of Europe, making them believe that we were caught up in a series of increasingly treacherous storms filled with sea monsters and that our last act was to inform them. That way, it might take some generations before their curiosity returns. Alternatively, we could inform the Portuguese of our true intentions, providing us with a potential future ally in Europe."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME15:0 "A good catch, send them the fraudulent message!"
 nhs_flightevents.15.b:0 "We should tell them where we're going; what if they discover our treachery?"
 nhs_flightevents.21.t:0 "A Storm approaches"
 nhs_flightevents.21.d:0 "It has been many weeks of good sailing, we were smart to take far more supplies than required. A storm approaches now though, and it looks like we'll get caught by it whatever we do. After a long struggle we passed through it, however..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME21A:0 "It took one of the treasure ships!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME21B:0 "It took one of the supply ships!"
 nhs_flightevents.22.t:0 "The Pantheon Worship"
 nhs_flightevents.22.d:0 "The storm lies a few days behind us now, leaving many at the edge of despair. A cleric asked to see you, and you invited him into your quarters. He's a very charismatic man, capable of inspiring men in the face of death, and he served us well in the armies fighting against the Ottomans. So it seems strange that he of all men would suggest such a thing: return to worshipping the Old Gods, the Roman and Hellenic Gods. He says he studied our history and noticed a downward trend ever since the first emperor converted to Christianity, he states that despite being the servants of God he did not help defend Jerusalem or Constantinople from the Muslims, and the recent storm can only illustrate the temper of Poseidon. If there are Gods, he continued, they must be as flawed and ill-tempered as the old Hellenic Gods. We would do best to appease them, rather than speak to a God that may listen, but seems not to care."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME22A:0 "You make a compelling argument..."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME22B:0 "Haha, that's a good one!"
 nhs_flightevents.31.t:0 "The Settlement"
 nhs_flightevents.31.d:0 "Some of our ships went ahead and founded a preliminary camp. The main fleet will arrive to unload cargo later. All things considered, this expedition couldn't have gone much better, we're lucky to have found land with enough supplies left to last a year!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME31:0 "There's work to be done!"
 nhs_flightevents.32.t:0 "The Empire of Elysia"
 nhs_flightevents.32.d:0 "Despite everything - despite all the hardship, toil, battles, storms, and plagues - we have succeeded. We have successfully arrived in the Varangians' western land. Truly, such a verdant land beyond the Pillars of Herakles can only be the Elysium from ancient myth! It is only now, however, that the cost becomes apparent: Every scrap of technology; every single book from the Imperial Library; every scroll detailing schematics or architecture or mathematics is one less bushel of wheat or one less person we could've taken. On top of that, the Ottoman Turks have probably already invaded what's left of our home the minute we stripped the garrisons and set sail."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME32:0 "What's done is done"
 nhs_flightevents.33.t:0 "Our new Home"
 nhs_flightevents.33.d:0 "With the help of our oracles we have been able to read the signs given by the gods through flocks of birds. Even before arriving in these new lands the gods had sent us these signs and instructed us to name our nation thus. Let us celebrate with wine and geese!"
 BYZFLIGHTNAME33:0 "It is decided then!"
 nhs_flightevents.100.t:0 "Forgotten Homelands"
 nhs_flightevents.100.d:0 "We are no longer aware of what goes on in our ancient homelands. Now oblivious to the old world, we can focus on the new world ahead of us."
 BYZFLIGHTNAME100:0 "Will we ever return?"

 nhs_flightevents.200.t:0 "A great catastrophe has occurred!"
 nhs_flightevents.200.d:0 "After surviving the Great Storm, a number of crew throughout the fleet became stricken with severe phthisis (tuberculosis). Despite the best efforts of our greatest physicians, Emperor $MONARCH$ also fell victim to the disease. While some say that it is just an unfortunate tragedy, others say that it is divine punishment for fleeing Konstantinoupolis in its darkest hour. Regardless, $MONARCH$'s brother $HEIR$ has been crowned Emperor, and will finish what his brother started."
 nhs_flightevents.200.a:0 "Good luck to him!"
 nhs_flightevents.201.t:0 "All Hope is Lost"
 nhs_flightevents.201.d:0 "Sadly both our emperor and his brother lie dead and the expedition has ended. Maybe next time we will fare better?"
 nhs_flightevents.201.a:0 "Who's idea was that?"

 nhs_flightevents.331.d:0 "Stepping off their ships, noble and commoner alike joined in prayer and held a great service in thanks to God. Even before arriving in these new lands God had sent us these signs and instructed us to name our nation thus. Let us celebrate with bread and wine!"
