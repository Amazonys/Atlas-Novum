 string_start_byzantium:0 "The rump state of §YByzantium§! has fallen into a very sad state indeed. Starting since the humiliating defeat by Alp Arslan in the battle of Mantzikert in 1071, the then Seljuk Empire overran most of §YByzantium's§! Anatolian heartland and so establishing the Turkish reign in the region that later became known as the §YSultanate of Rûm§!. Over the centuries, partly due to the Crusades, the Byzantines slowly recovered under the §YKomnenos§! dynasty, reconquering the Bulgarian lands as well as most of coastal Anatolia. The reconquests however came to a grinding halt due to the infamous events of the §YFourth Crusade§! in 1204 that dissolved the §YByzantine Empire§! and saw great destruction of the City of the World's Desire, §YConstantinople§!. The §YByzantine§! noble families fled and established the three Greek successor states; the §YDespotate of Epirus§!, the §YEmpire of Trebizond§! and the §YNicaean Empire§!. \n\n§YLatin§! reign in §YConstantinople§! was short, as the §YBulgars§! conquered most of Thrace and the §YNicaean Empire§! retook the §YLatin§! Anatolian holdings. In 1261, the then general-regent §YMichael VII Palaiologos§! that ended up in charge of the §YNicaean Empire§! in 1259 reconquered Constantinople. Upon doing so, he blinded the current 7 years old child-emperor §YJohn IV Laskaris§!, thus establishing the §YPalaiologos§! dynasty together with the Empire. Since then, the §YPalaiologoi§! have been ruling the §YByzantine§! state. Over the years however, the Empire would gradually lose more and more of its lands to the Turkish beyliks, established after Mongol conquests which left most of Anatolia in ruins. One particular beylik to this day is standing right at the gates of §YConstantinople§!, and has since §YMurad II§! managed to secure their tribute. \n\nIn their last attempts at ensuring the Empire's survival, the §YPalaiologoi§! turned their pleas to the West and the Pope. This culminated in the §YCouncil of Florence§!, where an attempt at mending the Great Schism under the Catholic Pope was made in return for military support against the Ottomans. The council however had little to no support in the Empire, while also managing to cause great turmoil and elections of antipopes in Europe. In the end, the council did little to help the already dwindling §YByzantine Empire§!, but rather furthered the hate towards the West among the populace. \n\nRuling from the Blachiarnae Palace in §YConstantinople§!, the §YPalaiologoi§! control the Despotate of Morea where the heir-apparent is left to govern, while exacting tribute over the waning Latin states of §YAthens§! and §YLesbos§!. Now, as the Ottoman ruler §YMehmet II§! has set his eyes on conquering Constantinople in the name of Islam, a sense of impending doom fills the air. The current tributary status is shaky at best and with the §YTheodosian Walls§! growing ever more obsolete in the age of gunpowder, §YByzantium§! cannot rely on them forever. Thus, drastic actions must be taken if the Empire is to ever resurge from the seeming abyss..."
