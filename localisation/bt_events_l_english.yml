 #New details to BtP Stuff
 btpIRE.EVTNAME2:0 "Vassal Defies the Throne"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC2:0 "Our former vassals, vested with their positions and titles by our very throne years ago, are refusing to acknowledge our rule and declaring themselve independant rulers of our land! Even worse, there is talk that some of our holdings in Ireland may join with these usurpers, plunging our holdings in Ireland into civil war!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA2:0 "Reclaim our land at once!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTB2:0 "This slap in the face will have to go unanswered, for now..." 
 embrace_irish_traditions_title:0 "Embrace Irish Culture"
 embrace_irish_traditions_desc:0 "When our ancestors were installed by the Anglo-Norman aristocracy hundreds of years ago, we were meant to represent English interests and curb local power, but Ireland has become our home. Gaelic traditions are observed, Irish is the language we hear spoken most often, and our closest allies and friends are the Gaels, not some distant English overlord. We should make this official!"
 create_the_kingdom_of_ireland_as_england_title:0 "Create the Kingdom of Ireland"
 create_the_kingdom_of_ireland_as_england_desc:0 "We have established dominance over Ireland, but we face the wrath of other European countries because of this annexation, and the rebellious nature of this frontier makes it difficult to govern effectively. The ideal solution may be to create a new Irish viceroyalty, similar to the former feudal system but significantly more organised, who may rule in our stead and protect our interests while distancing us from direct governance."
 cede_stragglers_to_koi_as_ruler_title:0 "Cede Irish Territory to Our Vassal"
 cede_stragglers_to_koi_as_ruler_desc:0 "We own land which de jure belongs to Ireland, our vassal kingdom. We may gift this land to them as a gesture of good will."
 btpIRE.EVTNAME3:0 "An Independent Government"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC3:0 "Our government, now independent from British control, faces many unique challenges. It must now reform and reorganise itself and, bereft of its former mandate to represent foreign interests in Ireland, reevaluate its priorities. Only time will tell will come from this metamorphosis, but whatever it may be, at least Ireland will now be free!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA3:0 "An important step."
 btpIRE.EVTNAME4:0 "The Future of Ireland"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC4:0 "After five tumultuous years of civil unrest, politcal debates, legal analysis, and passionate addresses the transitional government is preparing to make its final decision regarding the future of our fair nation.\n\nShall we returrn to the ancient Gaelic High Kingship, or shall we keep the traditions of our former British overlords, only this time enrich Ireland, not London?"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA4:0 "Our former masters had the right idea, but this time Ireland shall benefit!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTB4:0 "A free Irish state is Irish first! Return to the ancient traditions."
 btpIRE.EVTOPTC4:0 "There must be a compromise! We are Irish, but we are modern as well!"

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME1:0 "Faroese Culture Emerges"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC1:0 "A unique and distinct language and culture evolved from Old West Norse on the Northern Isles, know as Faroese and Norn. While initially still mutually intelligible with Norwegian, it slowly drifted away as Norway came more and more under the influence of Danish and East Norse, while the inhabitants of the Northern Isles maintained older traditions and even borrowed from nearby Gaelic traditions."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA3:0 "Interesting."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME4:0 "Distinct Norse-Gaelic Culture Fades"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC4:0 "The Gall-Ghaeil, or foreign Gaels, so called because they were ethnically Norse but culturally Gaelic, were once a dramatically different people than their native neighbours. As time wore on, however, the traditions and traits which defined them gradually faded and merged with their Gaelic allies. By the end of independent Norse-Gaelic kingdoms in Britain and the annexation of the Lordship of the Isles, these Norse-Gaels were quickly becoming indistinguishable from their Highland Scottish kin."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA4:0 "This should help the economy."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME7:0 "Fate of the Spanish Moors"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC7:0 "In a foolish decision of faith over economy, [From.GetName] have caused many of the Moors still living in their lands to leave."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC8:0 "The unruly population of the coastal estuary of the Wadi Sala has annouced the intention to found a republic, funded by very successful pirating endeavours against European trading routes. We could either allow this minor republic, and try to excercise some control over it, or forbid it at risk of open rebellion."

 #JP's East Frisia HRE idea, credit to JP with some changes from Draiocht.
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME9:0 "A Letter from Frederick III"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC9:0 "By the mid 15th century, Ulrich I Cirksena had united virtually all of the lordships of East Frisia, either directly or through marriages, but the count of Holland still claimed a part of his territory on the basis of an imperial grant in 1381. Lord Ulrich thus turned his attention to the Holy Roman Emperor in the hopes that Frederick III could confirm his position. In response, Frederick III raised Ulrich I to the status of imperial count in 1464, Granting the title of Imperial Count in Norden, Emden and Emisgonien in East Frisia, and bringing Count Ulrich I into the protection of the Holy Roman Empire."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC5:0 "Pal Gazulli was an Albanian Catholic priest, scholar, and diplomat who was an advisor to Skanderberg.  After the death of Georgius Pelino in 1463, he became the personal ambassador of Skanderbeg. His brother Gjon was also a diplomat of the League of Lezhë."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME6:0 "Anthony Cooke"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC6:0 "Anthony Cooke was an English humanist and scholar who served as a companion and guide to Edward VI. On Edward's Coronation, he became a Knight of the Bath, and served in the Parilament of Lewes. He was eventually imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1553 on the suspicion of complicity in Lady Jane Grey's movement."
 #Trade Misc
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME1:0 "End of Brugge's Golden Age"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC1:0 "From at least the 12th century, Brugge was the richest and most important port in the North Sea. However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a centre of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA1:0 "No! Spare no expense to clear the channel!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTB1:0 "There is nothing that can be done."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTC1:0 "Order the port and commerce moved to Sluis, nearer the sea."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME2:0 "Rise of Antwerp"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC2:0 "When the Golden Inlet filled with silt and trade shifted away from Brugge, the richest city in the North Sea for many centuries, it shifted in large part to Antwerp, which quickly rose to become the richest port in the North Sea, perhaps even the richest in the world."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA2:0 "Wonderful!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME3:0 "Fall of Antwerp"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC3:0 "Antwerp, one of the richest cities in the world by the late 16th century, was a very ripe target due to its wealth a relative lack of protection. In 1576, soldiers unhappy with their pay sacked and plundered the city, prompting a mass emmigration north, mostly to Amsterdam. After this, Antwerp would never again regain the importance and wealth it previously had."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA3:0 "No! Protect the city at all costs and reimburse everyone!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTB3:0 "There is nothing that can be done."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME4:0 "Rise of Amsterdam"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC4:0 "When Antwerp was sacked by the Spanish Fury, many of the skilled artisans, wealthy traders, and influencial families fled north, mostly to Amsterdam. This sudden immigration led to the rise of Amsterdam as a major world power and contributed to the so called 'Dutch Miracle', the transition of the Low Countries from minor vassal states to a major world power over the course of only 50 or 60 years."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA4:0 "Wonderful!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME5:0 "Golden Age of Amsterdam"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC5:0 "The Dutch Golden Age saw the growth of Amsterdam into the richest city in the world by the middle of the 17th century. At the head of a global trading network, its population exploded from under 5,000 in the early 15th century to nearly 250,000 in the 17th century."

 #Ireland's slightly particularistic religion events
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME1:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC1:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation, despite immense pressure from the Protestant Ascendancy and a series of Penal Laws designed to force the acceptance of Protestantism and the Church of Ireland. The continued attempts of the English, British, and Anglo-Irish to convert the Gaels led to many rebellions from the very start of the Reformation. Occasionally, however, a deal was struck that the Irish would be allowed to maintain their Catholicism in exchange for a pledge of loyalty to Dublin or London."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA1:0 "We must unite the Nation! Force the Gaels to accept the Reformation."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB1:0 "We cannot afford to press this issue. We must first secure the loyalty of our subjects."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME2:0 "Advance of the Ascendancy"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC2:0 "The papal domination over the Irish population of [Root.GetName] has ended, and has been displaced by a new majority."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA2:0 "Interesting tidings."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME3:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC3:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation. The abject failure of the Reformation to take hold in Gaelic Ireland is attributed to a variety of factors, foremost amongst which may have been the fact that, contrary to most other Reformist and Protestant movement in Europe, the Church of Ireland refused to make use of the local language, instead disseminating materials in English. Combined with Ireland's disillusionment with England's foreign policy this created the perception that the Reformation was yet another attempt to conquer Ireland and break Gaelic influence. Another important factor, however, was support and training from continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a religiously unified British Isles.\n\nAll the more was our surprise to learn that the Reformation had taken taken hold in [Root.GetName]. What do we do?"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA3:0 "Request support from our Catholic brothers and fund priests to save these souls at once!"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB3:0 "Let these heretics believe what they may, their contacts may even boost the local economy."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME4:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC4:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation, despite immense pressure from the Protestant Ascendancy and a series of Penal Laws designed to force the acceptance of Protestantism and the Church of Ireland. One important factor in this resistance was the support and ecclesiastical training of Gaelic priests by continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a unified Protestant British Isles.\n\nWe were thus not surprised to learn that Catholic rivals of ours on the continent have sent priests to [Root.GetName] in the hopes of returning the population to the Catholic faith. What do we do?"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA4:0 "Is the effort to turn the Gaels from Catholicism an endless struggle?! Let them be damned."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB4:0 "We must not waver in our faith. Do whatever must be done to show the Gaels the truth."
 #Celtic flavour!
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME1:0 "Selection of the Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The time has come to select a new Tanist from the available Righdamhna, or Kingly Material. All Dearbhfhine, the male decendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately accend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA1:0 "Select a suitable Tanist from the King's brothers, uncles and nephews."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB1:0 "Select the most competent of the King's cousins and second cousins as Tanist."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTC1:0 "Select the most competent of the King's cousins and second cousins as Tanist."    #this is the female possible version, not a mistake.
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTD1:0 "Refuse to select a Tanist, and wait for a royal heir to be born to the King."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTE1:0 "Appoint young [Root.Heir.GetName], even though he is not of age."

 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTG1:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make a fine Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTH1:0 "She may be a woman, but [Root.Heir.GetName] is capable."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTI1:0 "Let us abolish this outdated custom of Tanistry!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME2:0 "An Heir!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC2:0 "A new male heir is now in line to the throne of [Root.GetName]! Succession is secure and the throne is safe, alleviating the fears and misgivings of farmer and noble alike."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA2:0 "Wonderful news!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB2:0 "May [Root.Heir.GetName]'s place on the throne be guaranteed!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME3:0 "A... Female Heir?"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3:0 "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA3:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make an excellent ruler, there is nothing to fear."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB3:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will one day rule, reagardless of what these cowards say!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTC3:0 "A woman cannot fulfill the duties of the High King...."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME4:0 "Heir Comes of Age"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC4:0 "Young [Root.Heir.GetName] has finally come of age, and will be able to fulfill [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] duties should the High King die. At long last having a capable, adult Tanist will reassure the people and resolve the unrest bred from the fear of lacking leadership in a crucial time."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA4:0 "This should finally appease the naysayers."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME5:0 "A Strong Woman Candidate"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5:0 "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestocks. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA5:0 "One of the king's male cousins will make a fine choice."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB5:0 "To even be considered, this young woman must be worthy!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME6:0 "A High Queen Comes to Power"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC6:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] became High Queen of [Root.GetName] today in a grand coronation ceremony, recalling all the pride of the ancient traditions. Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband. If the High Queen is to prove these doubters wrong, she will have to endure much in the years to come."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA6:0 "She will have to prove herself..."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME7:0 "The High Queen Has Proven Herself"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC7:0 "After 20 years on the throne, the kingdom under the High Queen has not shriveled up and died. Calves continue to be born, harvests continue to ripen, and the people have not succumbed to some miasma of hopelessness and despair. Even the staunchest traditionalist is forced to admit that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has erased any doubt that a woman may rule in [Root.GetName]. In the future, female Tanists will likely face less resistance."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA7:0 "She has indeed proven herself!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME8:0 "Death of the Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC8:0 "Following the tragic death of our former Tanist, we are facing pressure to appoint a replacement so that our kingdom may never be without a strong leader in the event of the unexpected death of the king. The Dearbhfhine has met and the Righdamhna have presented themselves, all that remains is to vote in the new Tanist, who will immediately assume control of the kingdom in the event of the king's death."

Recently, however, our southerly neighbours, the Shilluk, are encroaching more and more upon our territory.

Using his wealth and influence he has managed to obtain considerable popular support and stands ready to sack our ancient capital of Soba, should we resist.

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME1:0 "The Reinheitsgebot"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC1:0 "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTOPTA1:0 "To better beer!"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME2:0 "Top or Bottom Brewing"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:0 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC3:0 "As new world crops were discovered by the Europeans and importing alcohols from the Old World became increasingly unfeasible, the colonial inhabitants began exploring options for distilling the crops grown in the region. The first to do this were the Spanish Conquistadors who distilled the first tequila from the agave plant in 1666 when they ran out of brandy. Later on, the bourbon whiskey was distilled from American maize and while not unique to the New World, rum was distilled from sugar molasses in the Carribean and Brazil by plantation slaves."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME4:0 "Prussian Blue"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC4:0 "In year 1706, a Swiss painter known as Johann Jacob Diesbach settled in Berlin managed to synthesize a new blue dye. This blue dye was coined \"Prussian Blue\" by its first trader in 1709 and was promoted and sold throughout Europe already the year before. Its composition remained unknown until the 1750s when a French chemist managed to decompose the dye into an iron salt and a new acid, isolated and termed 30 years later by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele as \"Blue acid\". Prussian Blue became very important in Europe as it obsoleted the very expensive lapis lazuli previously used for blue coloring, as well as becoming the main color used in Prussian army uniforms and continued to be used for ceremonial purposes up into the 20th century."

Though occasionally emperors have been able to exercise some influence over the succession and laws in Northern Italy and there are many circles which pledge loyalty to the Empire, this politicking has become, more than anything else, a way to avoid the temporal power of the Pope, and a long string of coalitions and alliances designed to resist imperial influence have arisen, starting with the Lombard League in 1167.  Though the Empire's de-facto control over Italy was tenuous at points, it wasn't until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that imperial power was formally broken and all claims over Italy retracted by the emperor as a concession of the treaty to end the Thirty Years' War."

Unfortunately, Fransez's infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pêr is also childless. The Montfort branch of the house of de Dreux is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise Fransez's eldest daughter, Marc'harid, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."

 #Metis events
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTNAME1:0 "The Métis"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTDESC1:0 "The early explorers and colonists arriving in French Canada were largely young men from low-born families looking for better opportunities than they might have had in their native France. Beginning in the 17th century, many of these French trappers and voyageurs began taking Algonquian women as wives in 'marriages à la façon du pays' or marriages according to the customs of the country. The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. This new race was called Métis by the French, meaning mixed race people."
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTOPTA1:0 "Who are we to judge?"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTOPTB1:0 "We must put an end to this!"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTNAME2:0 "The Anglo-Métis"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTDESC2:0 "Much like the French before them, the early explorers and colonists of British Canada occasionally took Algonquian or Dene women as wives. The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. Usually known as the Anglo-Métis, these people were also often called 'countryborn'."

The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. Usually known as Bungi, coming from the Cree word 'bangii', meaning 'little bit', these people were also often called 'countryborn'."

 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTNAME1:0 "A Prospective Colonist"
 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTDESC1:0 "Today a brave young soul, low-born but ambitious, presented himself at the capital with the hope that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will grant him and a small group of followers land in the New World. With our ambitions in the New World widely known and the perceived lack of opportunities for advancement to those not born into wealth and position in [Root.Owner.GetName], he presumes to ask for land overseas in unclaimed territory.\nThis pioneer and his group of followers have even amassed a small sum, enough to purchase their own passage and start their new life, and only await your permission to grow our borders!"
 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTOPTA1:0 "Excellent, allow this group to depart immediately!"

 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTNAME1:0 "Canadian Culture"
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTDESC1:0 "The early French settlers in Canada came largely from the north and west of France, but once in the New World, the colonists soon established their own culture and traditions. Influenced by Algonquian and Huron natives, and shaped by the harsh realities of their frigid new home, these settlers began to call themselves 'Canadiens'."
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTOPTA1:0 "An intriguing development."
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTNAME2:0 "Afrikaner Culture"
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTDESC2:0 "The early settlers of the Cape Colony came mostly from the Low Countries and spoke Dutch, but quickly established their own culture and traditions in the face of the startling new reality in which they found themselves. Known as Boers (farmers), Burghers (citizens), or simply Afrikaners, this group is an entirely new people and at home in this distant land."

Despite occasional Roman victories, the advance of the Sultans and Beys has marched inexorably on, pushing our once great empire to the very gates of our great capital.
