 nhs_handicap_settlers:0 "Manpower Shortage"
 desc_nhs_handicap_settlers:0 "Because we have only recently founded our settlement and have only the people we brought with us, however many they may be, we have a serious lack of manpower. We simply can't spare any extra settlers to occupy themselves with protecting the settlement. This is even truer for our cavalry, we have a great lack of horses and will need substantial breeding to get the amount required for army use."
 nhs_constrained_resources:0 "Constrained Resources"
 desc_nhs_constrained_resources:0 "We are unable to move too far from our territory to expand because of the lack of roads, supply ships, and adequate organisation of our long range expansionary efforts. This translates to a practical inability to supply island colonies or territories not immediately connected to our own. If we can somehow find the strength and economical power to restore this capability, we would have so much more potential!"
 nhs_organised_expansion:0 "Organised Expansion"

 desc_nhs_expanded_pantheon:0 "We have embraced a good number of Gods from other beliefs or have connected them to our own to expand our Pantheon and corresponding Mythos. There are many Gods in this world, and it would be wrong to simply discard the ones we don't already know. Our High Priests watch over the correct adoption and worship of significant unknown Gods, and a greater number of worshipper are now included in our religious society."
 nhs_consolidated_pantheon:0 "Consolidated Pantheon"
 desc_nhs_consolidated_pantheon:0 "We have consolidated our existing Pantheon of Gods to cement the authority and importance of the faith in people's daily lives.

 nhs_extended_city_senate:0 "Extended Senate of Cities"
 desc_nhs_extended_city_senate:0 "We are accepting senators from the newly annexed cities as soon as we've officially taken control of them. This helps greatly in integrating them into our realm, but does complicate our internal politics a little..."

 desc_nhs_settler_heritage:0 "Our descent from a settled civilisation is still prevalent in our daily lives. Our country isn't as densely populated as regular nations, which shows in the size of our armies, and our navies are still proud to be the focus of our national tale.

 nhs_silk_quarter:0 "The Silk Quarter"
 desc_nhs_silk_quarter:0 "This quarter houses both the workshops and the homes of those working in the silk production. Every part of the manufacturing process is carefully separated from the rest, so very few people actually know and understand the full process.

 nhs_hippodrome_decay:0 "Desolated Hippodrome"

 nhs_elysian_fort_3:0 "Expanded Fortifications (III)"
 desc_nhs_elysian_fort_3:0 "In their slow, shameful defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Hellenes learned the importance of strong fortifications for the survival and prosperity of the nation. This knowledge translated into tradition, and that tradition led to impressive defenses all over Elysia. The fortifications of this stronghold have reached a level of perfection. On top of extra defenses, more space for training and housing recruits has been added."
 nhs_elysian_fort_weakened:0 "Weakened fortifications"
 desc_nhs_elysian_fort_weakened:0 "Poor maintenance of the local Elysian fort led to walls that might as well be Aztec pyramids. The walls that cannot be scaled like pyramids don't have to be, since they've got more holes in them than Swiss cheese."
