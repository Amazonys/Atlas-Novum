TO PROPERLY TRANSLATE ATLAS NOVUM:

1. Move the !Translate_DoubleByte.mod file from MANUAL-GIT-INSTALL folder to /mods folder.
2. Download and install the latest Double-Byte translate DLL from https://github.com/matanki-saito/EU4dll/releases
3. Ensure that Atlas Novum: Chinese Translation loads AFTER Atlas Novum

Notes: 
This is currently an Atlas Novum compatible implementation of Chinese Language Mod for 1.33 by Bruceczk - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1999050560
If you are still having issues with getting the translation to show, try moving all of the files in /localization into a new subfolder called "replace" (move all localization files to localization/replace/).
Please be warned, my native language is American English. I did not translate anything in Atlas Novum. If you are a native speaker and would like to help translate the mod's changes to Chinese, in addition to Bruceczk's vanilla translations, please reach me on Discord.
