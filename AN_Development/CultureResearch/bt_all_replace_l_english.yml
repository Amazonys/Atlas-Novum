 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:1 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top- and bottom-fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

Unfortunately, François' infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pierre is also childless. The house of Montfort is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise François' eldest daughter, Marguerite, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."

In order to stabilize the situation [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent a plea for our help. [From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] offers [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] servitude and loyalty if we are willing to protect Crimea from her enemies."         #Cut the mention of 'as well as direct ownership of a number of Black Sea ports' & rearranged to sound fluid with the cut.
