 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The time has come to select a new Tanist from the available Righdamhna, or Kingly Material. All Dearbhfhine, the male descendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately ascend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC2:0 "A new male heir is now in line to the throne of [Root.GetName]! Succession is secure and the throne is safe, alleviating the fears and misgivings of farmer and noble alike."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3:0 "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC4:0 "Young [Root.Heir.GetName] has finally come of age, and will be able to fulfill [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] duties should the High King die. At long last having a capable, adult Tanist will reassure the people and resolve the unrest bred from the fear of lacking leadership in a crucial time."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5:0 "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestock. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC6:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] became High Queen of [Root.GetName] today in a grand coronation ceremony, recalling all the pride of the ancient traditions. Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband. If the High Queen is to prove these doubters wrong, she will have to endure much in the years to come."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC7:0 "After 20 years on the throne, the kingdom under the High Queen has not shriveled up and died. Calves continue to be born, harvests continue to ripen, and the people have not succumbed to some miasma of hopelessness and despair. Even the staunchest traditionalist is forced to admit that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has erased any doubt that a woman may rule in [Root.GetName]. In the future, female Tanists will likely face less resistance."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC8:0 "Following the tragic death of our former Tanist, we are facing pressure to appoint a replacement so that our kingdom may never be without a strong leader in the event of the unexpected death of the king. The Dearbhfhine has met and the Righdamhna have presented themselves, all that remains is to vote in the new Tanist, who will immediately assume control of the kingdom in the event of the king's death."

Having learnt that the neighboring Siamese had claimed rights over Malacca, the Portuguese viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, sent three envoys to Ayutthaya in an attempt to establish friendly relations. The third of these envoys, led by Duarte de Coelho, concluded with a treaty signed between Portugal and Siam. In exchange for guns and ammunition, the Siamese guaranteed religious freedoms, and agreed to facilitate the efforts of the Portuguese in establishing local settlements and trade networks. As many as three hundred Portuguese nationals later settled down in Ayutthaya, with many traders and military experts being among them."

During this time, Si Sudachan was engaged in an adulterous relationship with a government officer known by his noble title of Phanbut Si Thep, who rose to prominence under the new title of Khun Chinnarat. In 1548, the young King Kaeofa was executed at Khok Phraya Temple, and Lady Si Sudachan declared Khun Chinnarat king, styling him King Worawongsa. The two, both being members of the deposed Uthong clan, were met with nationwide opposition from the other noble houses, who despised the immorale and brutal return of Uthong. United under the banner of the Suphannaphum clan, members of the Sukhothai, Suphannaphum, and Si Thammarat clans united against Uthong, and assassinated the usurper and his adulteress, handing over the throne to Prince Thian, who was proclaimed King Maha Chakkraphat."

The city was described as being a forty day journey away from India, where clove, nutmeg, porcelains and silk were sold in abundance. Supposedly, the city was ruled by a Christian sovereign, who could amass an army of ten thousand men for war, which prompted King Manuel to find the city. A first expedition was launched in 1509, but ultimately failed, resulting in the capture of most of the soldiers at the hands of the Sultan. In 1511, the Viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, launched a second expedition to sieze Malacca. In July, following a rejected ultimatum to release all the prisoners from the 1509 expedition, the Sultan strengthened his defenses to prepare for an inevitable invasion. Over the course of two assaults, Albuquerque's men conquered the city, pillaging the households of those not allied to the Portuguese. The Sultan of Malacca tried several times to retake the city, but all attempts failed, leading to the eventual downfall of the Sultanate."

Upon his death, the rule of Naples was ceded to this illegitimate son, Ferdinand, while his brother John II of Aragon incorporated Sicily into the Crown of Aragon. This sparked a series of events such as Pope Calixtus III laying claims over all of Naples as a papal fief (Though he died before he could push these claims), as well as causing great unrest among the Neapolitan nobility. Eventually, when the Italian Wars erupted some decades down the line, the French kings claimed rightful succession to Naples itself and attempted its conquest.

 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC1:0 "From at least the 12th century, Brugge was the richest and most important port in the North Sea. However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a centre of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC2:0 "When the Golden Inlet filled with silt and trade shifted away from Brugge, the richest city in the North Sea for many centuries, it shifted in large part to Antwerp, which quickly rose to become the richest port in the North Sea, perhaps even the richest in the world."

After this, Antwerp would never again regain the importance and wealth it previously had."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC4:0 "When Antwerp was sacked by the Spanish Fury, many of the skilled artisans, wealthy traders, and influential families fled north, mostly to Amsterdam.

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC1:0 "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:0 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC3:0 "As new world crops were discovered by the Europeans and importing alcohols from the Old World became increasingly unfeasible, the colonial inhabitants began exploring options for distilling the crops grown in the region. The first to do this were the Spanish Conquistadors who distilled the first tequila from the agave plant in 1666 when they ran out of brandy. Later on, the bourbon whiskey was distilled from American maize and while not unique to the New World, rum was distilled from sugar molasses in the Carribean and Brazil by plantation slaves."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC4:0 "In year 1706, a Swiss painter known as Johann Jacob Diesbach settled in Berlin managed to synthesize a new blue dye. This blue dye was coined \"Prussian Blue\" by its first trader in 1709 and was promoted and sold throughout Europe already the year before. Its composition remained unknown until the 1750s when a French chemist managed to decompose the dye into an iron salt and a new acid, isolated and termed 30 years later by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele as \"Blue acid\". Prussian Blue became very important in Europe as it obsoleted the very expensive lapis lazuli previously used for blue coloring, as well as becoming the main color used in Prussian army uniforms and continued to be used for ceremonial purposes up into the 20th century."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC5:0 "As the Enlightenment spread across Europe, several important advancements in science were made by natural philosophers. One of these advancements concerned the complex science of bees and their biology, a topic that had not previously been researched. Some notable pioneers were Jan Swammerdam & René Ferchault de Réamur, who used microscopes to dissect bees to understand internal bee biology. They observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but it was not until François Huber had his advisor conduct careful experiments that they understood the mating process of bees. They found that queens were inseminated through a number of successive mating with male drones, which occurred high in the air, distant from their hive. They were also the first to describe bees' reproductive organs. Huber is today regarded as the father of modern bee-science for his discoveries and research while simultaneously breaking new ground in the formative years of modern biology."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC6:0 "Beekeeping in Medieval and Renaissance Europe was a complex science that no regular peasant really understood. Beekeeping was therefore mostly left to the monks in abbeys, where the precious honey and beeswax was produced. This was not the only reason for its generally limited production, but in order to obtain said produce, beehives had to be destroyed, thus ruining any potential reuse of the bee colony. It also disallowed any potential selective breeding. This gradually changed during the 18th and 19th centuries, where successive inventions revolutionized beekeeping. Among these were Thomas Wildman's adjustments to beehive assembly. He fixed parallel arrays of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive. The bees would fix their combs onto these, which allowed for easy removal of bee-combs without destroying the hive itself. These movable comb hives were later perfected by Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who made use of the fact that there was a specific clearance between the wax combs which bees left unblocked by wax, something Huber had previously discovered. Langstroth carefully designed a series of wooden frames in a rectangular hive box which were easily removed by beekeepers for emptying or inspection. Langstroth's invention ultimately lead to the commercial mass production of honey in the western world."

They were mainly held in the cities of Lagny, Troyes, Provins and Bar-sur-Aube and the counts also protected the Jewish community, which actively participated in business development of these towns. The fairs foreshadow by their economic and influence throughout Europe, the first international financial centres. Our fairs allow us an international recognition and make our country one of the major economic power of the world, we have to perpetuate these in order to bring wealth in our land."

 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly transformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."

It was very famous in its time, with Louis IX, Matthias Corvinus and Lorenzo de Medici all owning a copy. Such a military mind will surely help our troops, especially during sieges."

Unfortunately, Fransez's infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pêr is also childless. The Montfort branch of the house of de Dreux is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise Fransez's eldest daughter, Marc'harid, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."

Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inherit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a competent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between cousins."

 MNC_idea_1:0 "Port Hercules"
 MNC_idea_1_desc:0 "Monaco has long been associated with the great hero Hercules. When the Ancient Greek colonists first settled our lands, local veneration for Hercules was so intense that they named their colony Mònoikos, possibly as a reference to their sole worship of the demigod. According to legend, Hercules personally would build Monaco's natural harbor and coastal roadway during one of his many travels. The spirit of Hercules and his constructions continues to inspire our people."
 MNC_idea_2:0 "Rock of Monaco"
 MNC_idea_2_desc:0 "Overlooking our Principality is the monolithic Rock of Monaco. An impressive and strategic position, whoever controls the Rock essentially controls our country. Additionally, the mountain's seaside location makes it the perfect position to harass local sea lanes. The Rock of Monaco is the core of our territory, and it would be prudent to fortify it further."
 MNC_idea_3:0 "Francesco il Malizia"
 MNC_idea_3_desc:0 "The origins of the Grimaldi Dynasty are directly linked to the Republic of Genoa. To survive and thrive as a statesman in Genoa requires fair share of cunning and the occasional bit of treason. Such devious political machinations are how the Grimaldis first came in possetion of Monaco, when Francesco the Malicious snuck a group of armed Guelph's disguised as monks into the fortress on the Rock."
 MNC_idea_4:0 "Lord of Cagnes"
 MNC_idea_4_desc:0 "Alas, Francesco's seizure Monaco was not to last. Nonetheless, a veteran of that endeavor would eventually return to reign over our Principality. This honor goes to Rainier I, the Lord of Cagnes and esteemed Admiral of France. His naval leadership was crucial to a combined Franco-Genoese Flotilla victory over the Flemings at the Battle of Zierikzee."
 MNC_idea_5:0 "Duke of Valentinois"
 MNC_idea_5_desc:0 "The first official sovereign Prince of Monaco would be Honoré II. Honoré's father would be murdered during his childhood, causing a regency to rule until he came of age. However the regent was extremely cozy with the Spanish Crown, inviting troops to occupy Monaco and confiscating Monegasque weaponry. Honoré II would be a resounding voice for Monaco's independence and a fierce critic of Spain. His diplomatic prowess lead to Monaco seeking protection and friendship with France."
 MNC_idea_6:0 "Marquis of Baux"
 MNC_idea_6_desc:0 "Named in honor of both his grandfather and Hercules, Ercole would be the only son of Honoré II. The tradition of naming the Monegasque heir apparent as 'Marquis of Baux' began with him. A modern military man, Ercole would become quite interested in the proliferation of firearms. However, curiosity killed the cat, and in this case it killed Ercole too when an incompetant musketeer accidentally shot him in the back during rifle drills."
 MNC_idea_7:0 "Menton and Roquebrune"
 MNC_idea_7_desc:0 "The border towns of Menton and Roquebrune are both small but proud. Their pleasant climates and ample opportunities are starting to attract migrants from inland parts of France and Occitania. Alongside this, Menton is home to an ever growing citrus industry, turning in a handsome profit. If we begin to impose higher taxes on both towns we will easily capitalize on their growing population and wealth. Theres no possible way this can backfire!"
 
 #Baghdad Event Tooltips
 BTTurkomanEvents.1.t:0 "Death of Ispend bin Yusuf"
 BTTurkomanEvents.1.d:0 "In 1431, our late Emir, Ispend bin Yusuf, defeated the last of the Jalayrid rulers of Lower Mesopotamia. When Ispend returned to Baghdad, he took control from the Qara Qoyunlu governor, Shâh Muhammed, who then fled to Tabriz. Ispend began to mint his own coins in Baghdad, fancying himself the 'Emir' of Baghdad and describing his realm as a 'kingdom'.\n\nIspend bin Yusuf was never a loyal subject of the family leaders in Tabriz after the death of Qara Iskander in 1435, allowing refugees and disgruntled family members to settle in Baghdad. One of those, Ispend's nephew, became his favourite and designated heir - Alvand Mirza.\n\nNow that Ispend has died, the nobles of Baghdad have to decide who should rule the city and its environs. Ispend wished us to enthrone Alvand Mirza, though this will likely upset [QAR.Monarch.GetName]. We could do as [QAR.Monarch.GetName] wishes, and appoint Ispend's son, [Root.Heir.GetName], though this would leave us with a Regency Council until he comes of age."

Local nobles in Baghdad have requested our support in removing [IRQ.Monarch.GetName].\n\nEither [Root.Monarch.GetName] can invade to restore order and depose [IRQ.Monarch.GetName], reclaiming Lower Mesopotamia for ourselves, or we can accept our weakening influence over the rebellious ruler in Baghdad."
