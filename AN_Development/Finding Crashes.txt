# This document is meant to be a handy tool to help identify certain types of crashes, also called "CTD"
# A good method of identifying a crash issue when nothing else works is combing through all the files.
# I find the "splitting 50/50" method to be the fastest way. If for example an event is the issue,
# but you don't know which, you take half of all event files/folders and temporarily delete them.
# Reboot and narrow it down 50/50 until the game doesn't crash. Then you use "discard changes" in github
# (and you can select multiple files at the same time for this) and reboot... I think you get the idea.
