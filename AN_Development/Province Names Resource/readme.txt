# DISCLAMER: ENCODE FILES IN ANSI!!


# If a province_name file has over 100 unique entries, make sure you start using the template 1-13602+ (which you find in template_file folder)
#
# What this means is, even if germanic for example doesn't have a province name for each province
# It should have empty "slots" like #5083 = { "" "" }
# This makes sure new province names can be easierly added
# Below 100ish entries and you can simply organise after number size
# (unless you plan to add more in the future)
#
#
# Any questions just ask Bluehunter :D
