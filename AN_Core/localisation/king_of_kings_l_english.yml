 byz_roman_empire:0 "The Roman Empire"
 byz_roman_empire_desc:0 "We are the true Roman Empire, created as a result of the west-east split and the only surviving remnant. The so-called 'Holy Roman Emperors' are none of those things and the pretenders to our rule in Constantinople are just that - foolish pretenders."
 byz_protect_the_frontiers:0 "Protect the Frontiers"
 byz_protect_the_frontiers_desc:0 "As our empire sees a restoration, so do our frontiers. Let us take an example from the past and properly fortify the border, utilizing the themes as a medium."

 byz_corpus_iuris_civilis_desc:0 "Corpus Iuris Civilis was a codex of laws. Issued by Justinian, it has long been replaced by newer works, but its name could be reutilized as a prestigious title for a brand-new codex."
 
 BYZ_false_despots_title:0 "False Despots"
 BYZ_false_despots_desc:0 "The Despotate of Epirus was established as one of the remnants of the Byzantine Empire following the disaster of 1204. However, it would in time fall under the control of the Neapolitans, further bolstering the Latin influence in Greece. This stronghold must be wiped out!"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_title:0 "Recover Magna Graecia"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_desc:0 "Magna Graecia, the territories settled by Greek Colonies in ancient times, have long been lost to the decline of our Empire. With competent leadership and a powerful navy, it is time to retake those territories and reinstate Roman government in the southern tip of Italy."
 BYZ_carthage_title:0 "Exarchate of Africa"
 BYZ_carthage_desc:0 "The Roman Province of Africa has long been a core territory of the Roman Empire. Upon the Empire's division, it would in no less than a century fall under the rule of the Vandals. It would once again be brought to Roman Lands thanks to Justinian's ambitions. Then it would fall to the Caliphate in 7th century."
 BYZ_impending_doom_title:0 "The Impending Doom"
 BYZ_impending_doom_desc:0 "The Empire is at the brink of destruction. Every Roman citizen is silently aware that the end is nigh, and the days of Roman glory are already numbered. But is there really no hope for the crumbling empire? With the emperors struggling to make alliances with the west and seeking support, there might still be a chance for recovery."
 BYZ_bar_title:0 "Vengeance at Bar"
 BYZ_bar_desc:1 "The disastrous Battle of Bar ensured the Serbian realm was to remain independent from the Byzantine Empire for years to come. While we did manage to strike back at the Serbians since then, they were still able to take over much of our territory and did found the Serbian Empire. Since then, they have succumbed to decline of their own as well. Let us strike them while they are still down!"
 BYZ_illyria_title:0 "Advance into Illyricum"
 BYZ_illyria_desc:0 "The current state of Illyria is a cause for concern. Lately, there has been an increasing amount of interest in the area taken by the Habsburgs, who are trying to exploit the power vacuum in the area and to take ownership of the region."
 BYZ_belisarius_foe_title:0 "Belisarius' Foe"
 BYZ_belisarius_foe_desc:0 "The war against Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy is one of the crowning achievements of Justinian's rule and proof of the military prowess of his general, Belisarius. The struggle against the Ostrogoths proved to be long and exhausting, but it was ultimately successful."
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_title:0 "Justinian's Ambition"
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_desc:0 "The rule of Justinian, one of the most revered Eastern Roman Emperors, was one of glory and success. It is during his rule that the most successful attempt was made at bringing the Roman Empire back to a reality."
 BYZ_iberia_title:0 "Non Plus Ultra"
 BYZ_iberia_desc:0 "To the west lies the strait of Gibraltar, surrounded by the two Pillars of Hercules. The Romans of old believed that beyond Iberia there lies nothing. The sailors of old were warned that there is 'non plus ultra' - nothing further beyond. Today we know there is much west of Iberia that the Spanish have conquered. Let our forces march and claim Hispania with its colonies as rightful Roman territory."
 BYZ_greece_title:0 "Reverse the Downfall"
 BYZ_greece_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has been consistently declining for about a millennium now. With small periods of recovery from time to time, today we may be lying at the definitive end of our journey. With the Ottoman encroaching and lusting for the city of world's desire, the end is looming. While the Ottomans are still occupied, let us strike and bolster our hold in Greece - our most core territory."
 BYZ_bulgaria_title:0 "Reconquer Bulgaria"
 BYZ_bulgaria_desc:0 "While we may have succeeded in retaking Greece from Ottoman hold, the second fight may not be any better. Let us hope the Bulgarian nobles oppose their Muslim overlords more than our rule, exposing themselves to our influence once again."
 BYZ_aegean_islands_title:0 "Repulse the Republics"
 BYZ_aegean_islands_desc:0 "As our state expands and finds itself in a stronger position, the presence of the Latin Republics in our vicinity turns to be more of an impediment than support. It is time to end our lip service to the merchants. The Aegean islands belong to us and our [Root.GetBurghersName]."
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_title:0 "Venetian Avarice"
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_desc:0 "Constantinople fell victim to a siege by the Catholics in 1204. Sacked by Crusaders, who were initially intending to battle Muslims to the east, they would later betray their ideals and turn their attention towards our city and with the support from the treacherous Venetians, the megalopolis would fall to their combined forces in April of that accursed year. The capture would lead to a period of sacking when an innumerable amount of riches and priceless icons were stolen from the Queen of Cities. The Fall of Constantinople led to the establishment of Latin Empire, whose rule was called frankokratia. That period, albeit short, would accelerate the decline and further weaken the empire."
 BYZ_france_title:0 "Beyond the Alps"
 BYZ_france_desc:0 "Beyond the Northern mountains of Italy lie the lands in Gallia, nowadays referred moreso as France, where the descendants of the Gauls and invading Germanic Tribes rule a powerful kingdom. Let us muster the forces from Italy and conquer that kingdom which is suffering from delusions of imperial ambitions."
 BYZ_france_ct:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on all provinces in §YBritain§!, §YLow Countries§! and §YWest Germany§! needed for the §YRestore the Roman Empire§! decision."
 BYZ_roman_empire_title:0 "Basileia Rhomaion"
 BYZ_roman_empire_desc:0 "It has been over a millennium since the two Roman Empires were still united. Split in 395, there were hopes that the act would help stop the decline of the Empire and its political system. Instead, the western half would fall in 476 and eastern half would almost fall to the Ottomans in 15th century. Nobody back then would have believed that the heirs of the Eastern monarchs would rule an Empire whole again. The proclamation of the restored Roman Empire is deserving of a great Triumph in Rome itself."
 BYZ_coast_title:0 "Asia Minor"
 BYZ_coast_desc:1 "Though already long conquered and settled by the Ottoman Turks, the western edges of Anatolia are still somewhat core territory of ours. With many Greeks living in the cities and in coastal towns, the reconquest of those territories could prove beneficial to strengthening our maritime commerce and general strength."
 BYZ_avenge_1071_title:0 "Avenge 1071"
 BYZ_avenge_1071_desc:0 "130 years prior to Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders, the Roman Empire suffered a tragic defeat on the fields of Manzikert, sealing the fate of Roman Anatolia. Following this loss, Anatolia would come to be permanently settled by the Turks, fierce opponents, and rivals to our state. Having driven them out of Greece and Eastern Asia Minor, we should bring an end to their rule in the entirety of Anatolia."
 BYZ_syria_title:0 "Antiochia & Jerusalem"
 BYZ_syria_desc:0 "Syria is home to two of the Pentarchy seats. Settled since ancient times, home to Jesus Christ himself, we must take full control of the province and restore this important region back to the Roman Empire."
 BYZ_egypt_title:0 "Into Aegyptus"
 BYZ_egypt_desc:1 "Holding the Bishopric of Alexandria and the delta of the Nile, Egypt is critical to [Root.GetName] for more reasons than one. To take full control of this province should be our utmost priority and the rule over it is bound to bring us obscene wealth and power. We will unleash its potential and all those before us shall be treated as those who could not wield the true power the region provides."
 BYZ_breadbasket_title:0 "The Breadbasket"
 BYZ_breadbasket_desc:0 "The Nile is the lifeline of the Egyptian civilization. Providing an outstanding supply of irrigation and therefore food, with this great river any civilization can grow in population. Having reconquered the area, let us exploit the Nile to its fullest."
 BYZ_pontic_empire_title:0 "Princes of the Lazes"
 BYZ_pontic_empire_desc:0 "Following the disastrous fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, many minor splinters of the Empire have formed. One of them was the Komnenos realm formed in Pontus. Claiming to be the rightful heirs, they are mere pretenders destined to be destroyed. Their rule mostly extends over the Laz people. They are no emperors, but mere princes!"
 BYZ_persians_title:0 "Abase the Persians"
 BYZ_persians_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has a history of centuries full of feuds with the Persians over supremacy in Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Let us move in and deal a decisive blow to their ambitions and pride, forever thwarting their plans for lands west of the Zagros Mountains. They need to be humiliated!"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_title:0 "Follow the Rivers"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_desc:0 "One of the cradles of civilization that is Mesopotamia is surrounded by strong enemies and lacks natural barriers. Let us ensure that it is no other great power's playground but ours. Persians shall have no say in those matters!"
 BYZ_mecca_title:0 "The Heart of Islam"
 BYZ_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."
 BYZ_economic_independence_title:0 "Economic Independence"
 BYZ_economic_independence_desc:0 "After 1204, the successive Emperors tried to make Byzantine markets into an invaluable asset of the Latin merchants, granting them various privileges and excluding them from the kommerkion - 10% customs tax on goods arriving in Constantinople. This had the disastrous effect of destroying our merchants' trust and letting them be outcompeted. Let us reclaim those markets."
 BYZ_return_to_gold_title:0 "Return to Gold"
 BYZ_return_to_gold_desc:0 "In the past, the Eastern Roman Empire would commit to minting gold coins for the subject. However, with loss of gold and silver mines, it would become increasingly difficult to strike such coins. The last gold coin to be struck was hyperperon, and even it would succumb to the usual fate of being debased to support military campaigns."
 BYZ_support_weavers_title:0 "Support the Weavers"
 BYZ_support_weavers_desc:0 "Silk-weaving has a relatively long history in Byzantium. With the smuggling of silkworms in sixth century, the art of sericulture has persisted for a millennium and various guilds of weavers have formed in larger cities. Let us support them and provide them with markets for their goods."
 BYZ_tarnished_state_title:0 "A Tarnished State"
 BYZ_tarnished_state_desc:0 "Our state has become tarnished by war and depopulation. Constant civil wars and conflicts have depleted our most invaluable asset - population. Let our lands be devastated no more and let the vacant homes not be empty any longer."
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_title:0 "Book of the Prefect"
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_desc:0 "With a growing number of merchants in the Queen of all cities, let us create new manuals and records to keep track of the local burghers. With so many guilds and exceptions, it is imperative the future eparchs have the experience to deal with them."
 BYZ_at_least_10_production_income:0 "At least §Y10.0§!¤ Monthly Income from §YProduction§!."
 BYZ_glass_ware_title:0 "Glass Wares of Byzantium"
 BYZ_glass_ware_desc:0 "The glassmaking of the eastern romans has been nothing short of incredible. Famous across Europe along with the imperial silks, it would influence the Venetian Crystal and give rise to many other styles in the process. But since the Latin merchants have taken over our markets, this art seems to have been lost to time, only remaining significant in Constantinople. Let us rectify that."
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_title:0 "City of World's Desire"
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_desc:0 "Constantinople, the seat of Eastern Roman Empire, bears many names and nicknames. From Byzantium through New Rome, all the way to 'Queen of Cities', the most fitting nickname will always remain to be 'The City of World's Desire', which perfectly exemplifies the envy of the surrounding states."
 BYZ_megalopolis_title:0 "The Megalopolis"
 BYZ_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 BYZ_royal_purple_title:0 "The Royal Purple"
 BYZ_royal_purple_desc:0 "Yet the most iconic of all Byzantine symbols has to be the Royal Purple dye. Tyrian Purple garments were the symbol of royalty and royal offspring would be born in a room glazed with purple rock, exceedingly rare at the time. The dye would be produced in several spots across the Empire, but the yields were never high, and availability remained limited. Let us restore the color to the Roman royalty."
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_title:0 "Promote the [Root.GetBurghersName]"
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_desc:0 "With our betrayal that we have inflicted upon our [Root.GetBurghersName], the trust between them and the state has become seriously strained. Let us rectify the mistakes of old and give them hope in our rule."
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_title:0 "Collect our Profits"
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_desc:0 "With our support of the merchants and loans provided to the manufacturers, it is high time we collected the interest on them. We reap what we sow, and we are about to feast on the fruits of our labor."
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_title:0 "Warehouse of the East"
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_desc:0 "With our support of manufacturers and the massive growth of cities and guilds, we have risen to a rank of manufacturing Entrepôt. With many prized goods originating right here, the Romans aren't just famous for their long and rich history, but also for the beauty of their fabrics that remains affordable to all."
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_title:0 "Peloponnesian Renaissance"
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_desc:0 "While Constantinople was in imminent danger of an invasion, a fraction of the Byzantine scholars has made Morea their home, giving the peninsula a true rebirth. Originating from Peloponnese was Gemistos Plethon, a philosopher who studied the works of Plato and had deep connections to the old beliefs."
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_title:0 "Monemvasian Merchants"
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_desc:0 "Monemvasia is a town off the eastern coast of Peloponnese. Situated in a unique position, the site became a local trade center, giving rise to several merchant families, among them the Notaras."
 BYZ_thessaly_title:0 "Trade in Thessaloniki"
 BYZ_thessaly_desc:0 "Thessaloniki would for a long time remain the secondary capital for the empire, fulfilling both political and maritime functions. Let us restore the city to its former glories!"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_title:0 "Wealth from the East"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_desc:0 "As the Empire expands to its old territories, the old trade routes become lively again. We have focused on bringing our core territories to their former selves, but we should do the same to the rest of the former empire! The wealth of the east should once again flow to Constantinople forevermore."
 BYZ_church_in_distress_title:0 "Church in Distress"
 BYZ_church_in_distress_desc:1 "The rightful Church is in distress. Greatly anxious regarding the monarch's decision to enter a union with Rome, the clergy is highly upset, with many priests downright defying the emperor. The faith in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty must be restored."
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_title:0 "Curb Russian Autocephaly"
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_desc:0 "Following the declaration regarding union of the churches, many bishops in other realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, instead choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the patriarch in Constantinople. Among them were the undisputed leaders of this movement in Russia. Let us coerce them to bring them back into the fold."
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_title:0 "Mend the Schism"
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_desc:0 "As a result of conflicts between the Roman supremacy and our rightful belief in equal rights, the supporters of Rome have severed their ties, causing a schism in the church in 1054. With excommunications placed on each other, both churches remain separate to this day. Only our force may rectify that."
 BYZ_church_authority_title:0 "Recover Authority"
 BYZ_church_authority_desc:0 "While we have curbed the anxiety of our priests, the average citizen's belief in the Monarch and Church has plummeted. We need to reassure the population who has been divinely chosen to lead them and this wave of impiety must be stopped."
 BYZ_new_synods_title:0 "New Synods"
 BYZ_new_synods_desc:0 "In the few centuries following Jesus' lifetime, the religious community of bishops has gathered in many Synods to discuss the faith in depth. With the evolution of the world, culture and changes in the socioeconomic sphere, it might be worthwhile to continue this tradition."
 BYZ_pentarchy_title:0 "Restore the Pentarchy"
 BYZ_pentarchy_desc:0 "Before the collapse of our Empire, the five Patriarchs in Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome and Constantinople used to live in relative peace and unity, convening on matters when necessary and serving our ecclesiastical community. Let's bring the golden age back."
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_title:0 "Reinforce Constantinople"
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_desc:0 "The mighty Theodosian Walls are in disrepair and the Ottoman threat in looming. We need to take action, lest we see our walls crumble like brittle glass."
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_title:0 "Defense in Depth"
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_desc:0 "If we want to hold an impenetrable defense, relying on just one aspect is not going to be enough of an assurance. We need multiple sets of walls and multiple plans in order to be prepared for any knavish trick our foes might have prepared."
 BYZ_hexamilion_title:0 "Hexamilion Wall"
 BYZ_hexamilion_desc:0 "The Hexamilion wall used to protect the isthmus in ancient times. Recently, the wall has been repaired to protect against the Ottomans, but that has failed too. We must either commit or give up on it."
 BYZ_theme_system_title:0 "The Theme System"
 BYZ_theme_system_desc:0 "The Theme System used to be our form of civilian and military governance. Due to the sudden decline in territory, the need for themes has been rendered non-existent. Let us restore this system for good."
 BYZ_restore_navy_title:0 "Restore Byzantine Navy"
 BYZ_restore_navy_desc:0 "The fall of importance of Dromon, supremacy of the Latin Galea, and our dependence on the Latin Republics for naval support has led to our fleet being essentially nought. With our shackles thrown, let us once again arm ourselves on the seas."
 BYZ_greek_fire_title:0 "Sea Fire"
 BYZ_greek_fire_desc:0 "The Greek Fire, known under many names by the Greeks, was among the most important innovations aiding the Eastern Roman Empire. It is the name for a substance that was discharged onto enemy ships and lit on fire, serving as an early flamethrower. This gave the Byzantine navy a significant edge over its maritime rivals, until the practice ceased when the sources of its ingredients were lost."
 BYZ_branching_bottom_title:0 "Branching Mission"
 BYZ_branching_bottom_desc:0 "This is a Branching Mission. Its triggers and effects will be based on our choice in 'The Theme System' mission."

 BYZ_foreign_officers_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Foreign Officers[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_foreign_officers_desc:0 "The general lack of manpower and skilled generals is evident. While not beneficial to the general state of the army, hiring foreign officers and their companies could bolster our reserves and staff."
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Pronoia Rights[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_desc:0 "The Pronoiars are mostly hereditary landholders who have been rewarded for their loyal military service. Perhaps the system could see amendments to improve their capabilities, perhaps mimicking the Ottoman Timars."
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Realms of the Strategoi[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_desc:0 "Through our choices the army has evolved into a decentralized collection of native and foreign generals, holding mostly hereditary tracts of land, where they recruit from the local population and give lands to their most loyal soldiers."
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Control over the Pronoiars[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_desc:0 "Pronoiars are mostly landowners whose land has been granted for military service. Initially non-inheritable, the posts would later become hereditary as being a pronoiar was no longer that special. This institution is of great service to our military, but it does require immediate reform."
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Reform the Themata[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_desc:0 "While Theme System functions, it is woefully outdated to modern needs. We need to reform it to better suit the future - an age of gunpowder and standing armies."
 BYZ_varangian_guard_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]The Varangian Guard[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_varangian_guard_desc:0 "The Varangian Guard was an elite unit within our military. Initially comprised of Viking mercenaries, it would later be reinforced by Anglo-Saxons. The unit would get integrated into the greater society and would cease to exist as a separate regiment. Many were claiming to be Varangians in the 1400s. It is time to restore this famous unit and modernize it."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.t:0 "Mending the Schism"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.d:0 "Since the Eastern and the Western Churches split in 1054, it seemed like there was no unity in sight and there wouldn't be for centuries to come. It almost seemed like the two churches would get reunited in the fifteenth century thanks to the terrible situation the Roman Empire found itself in, but it was able to return to grace, throwing off the shackles of Papal influence. Today, the Empire stands triumphant, having restored the Pentarchy and properly united the two churches, having swayed public opinion towards such outcome."

The population of the megalopolis was already prepared for this outcome, and many, even the poor, have begun solemnly praying to God to relieve the city. Processions are held from all the churches to call for divine intervention."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.50.a:0 "Thanks be to God!"
 
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.t:0 "Confirmation of the Council of Florence"
 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.d:0 "In 1439, Ioannes travelled to Florence alongside many orthodox religious scholars to discuss the matters of mending the schism with the Pope. With mounting pressure from the Monarch determined to earn support of the Pope and his subordinates, the Byzantines agreed to formally unite the two churches and to accept the superiority of the Pope. This move, while seemingly necessary, would cause the rise of the anti-unionist faction in Constantinople, sparking wide unrest in the last days of the city."

He demands that the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes a more hawkish stance on the issue of the Union between the Churches, and only then will he call the might of the Catholic community to support us in our war."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.54.d:0 "Having promised the Romans support in times of need, many expect the Holy Father to call a new crusade against the Ottomans.

Unfortunately, the islam overseas appears to be inherently syncretic with local beliefs, leading to many practices the scholars in Arabia would consider downright blasphemous.

His work possesses some potential, and at some spots the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can even recognize some artistic skills. Nonetheless, it is not an art piece to document for our descendants.\nThe [Root.GetTempleName] was certainly built with functionality over beauty.

The lines encapsulate perfectly the shape of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face while the coloring gives the portrayal an almost real feeling to it. One of the advisors noted jokingly the artist might be a charlatan as the portrait resembles more a mirror than a painting."
 SIGNIFICANT_PAINTING_STRING:0 "An impressive piece of [Root.GetAdjective] craftsmanship greets the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 NOTEWORTHY_PAINTING_STRING:0 "Although interesting and beautiful in its own right, the portrait presented by the artist is not of great significance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nor [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court. Still, it serves good enough to be the next object of envy from our rivals.\nIt depicts the [Root.Monarch.GetName] standing in the throne room. However, it is clear that the painter was much more so concerned about the court itself as many other characters dilute the image. Still, it suffices more than enough to decorate the court."
 GREAT_PAINTING_STRING:0 "Clearly, the painter exaggerated the quality and prestige his artwork would bring us. His work possesses some potential, and at some spots the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can even recognize some artistic skills. Nonetheless, it is not an art piece to document for our descendants.\nThe picture depicts a bowl filled with apples. He calls "still life". Although the objective quality is clearly present, a painting of a bowl of apples still is just a painting of a bowl of apples."
 PATHETIC_PAINTING_STRING:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had to pause for a moment as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gazes upon the soiled paper presented to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

The shape of the presumed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] are all in warped. The proportions are unrealistic at best, and outright nightmarish at worst.

 georgian_crisis.1.d:0 "In the dimly lit halls of our royal palace, the somber echoes of the King's failed attempts to restore order serve as a chilling reminder of the predicament that Georgia now faces. With each passing day, the grip of the crown slackens, its shine dulled by the tarnish of political failure and burgeoning chaos. Rumors from the west carry news of Demetrius rallying his nobles, their words seething with discontent and ambitious yearnings. His claims to the crown grow louder and more audacious, stoking the fires of an imminent conflict. Other nobles, once staunch supporters of the crown, now whisper of rebellion, their loyalty swaying in the face of uncertainty. It seems the feared crisis is upon us. With our kingdom fractured and at the precipice of civil war, we find ourselves in desperate need of decisive action. Will we regain control, or will we let the crown slip from our grasp?"
 georgian_crisis.1.a:0 "We will fight for our rightful rule!"
 georgian_crisis.2.t:0 "Order Restored"

The king's rule, once teetering on the precipice of collapse, now stands firm once again. The royal banner flies high above the castle, a symbol of our hard-fought victory and regained control. The nobles who once sought to exploit the instability of the crown now bow their heads in surrender, their dreams of autonomy crushed under the might of our united forces. Their rebellious fire has been doused, and our king's authority remains unquestioned."

 georgian_crisis.3.d:0 "In the midst of the chaotic Georgian Crisis, a courier arrives from the southwestern reaches of our realm. He brings a message from the Atabegs of Samtskhe, and his grim countenance bodes ill. The Atabegs have declared their independence, unwilling to remain under the faltering rule of the Bagrationi dynasty. This daring move is a chilling example of the damage our internal strife has wrought. The separatists see the weakened state of our kingdom as an opportunity to establish their rule, free from the burdens and controls of the central authority. The blow to our sovereignty is profound, adding to the challenges we face amidst the crisis. How we respond to this affront will have far-reaching implications for the fate of our kingdom."

Demetrius Bagrationi, our King's own brother, appears to have turned his ambition into action. As the ruler of Western Georgia, his latest move signifies a profound and direct challenge to our crumbling authority. His call for independence reverberates through the realm, sowing discord and inspiring other would-be separatists. The bonds that once held our Kingdom together seem to be fraying at an alarming rate, the strings of loyalty cut by the sharp edge of ambition. With the realm teetering on the brink of fragmentation, we are faced with a dire decision."

As the new custodians of this historic city, a critical decision now lies before us: Shall we embrace our glorious victory by relocating our capital to Constantinople, solidifying Georgia's reign over this symbolic heart of the empire?"
 #Events
 flavor_geo.1.t:0 "A Troubled Realm"
 flavor_geo.1.d:0 "Once a prominent power and unrivaled hegemon of the Caucasus, Georgia has suffered a dramatic downfall over the centuries, losing its eminent status. The prosperous era came to an abrupt end with the onslaught of the Mongols, Turks, and Timur, paving the way for a relentless fight for survival. This dwindling power was accompanied by an economic decline, leading to a desperate nobility demanding an increasing number of privileges.\n\nIn an attempt to address this issue, King Alexander I, following a time-honored Byzantine tradition, appointed his three sons as joint rulers, establishing a unique system known as a triarchy where the sons shared sovereignty over the kingdom. This arrangement, however, was short-lived as Alexander renounced his throne in 1442 and sequestered himself in a monastery.\n\nHis eldest son, Vakhtang, claimed the throne, yet with no successor to his name, the nobility and his brothers are biding their time, eagerly anticipating a chance to claim the crown for themselves. Hence, the future trajectory of our kingdom remains shrouded in uncertainty."

 flavor_geo.2.t:0 "Heirs of the Romans"
 flavor_geo.2.d:0 "For centuries, the Byzantine Empire valiantly defended Constantinople, but now the flame of Byzantine glory flickers. The time has come for Georgia to seize the mantle, to succeed where others have faltered, and to forge a new legacy upon the storied foundations of Rome. The Georgian Reconquest envisions a triumphant return to Constantinople, a rebirth of a new Roman era, with a Georgian ruler ascending the throne, guided by the principles of righteousness, strength, and unwavering faith. In this momentous event, Georgia, fortified by its indomitable spirit and military prowess, shall become the bulwark of the Orthodox world. The new Roman legacy, shaped by Georgian hands, will rekindle the flame of Byzantine glory and breathe new life into the Orthodox faith. The walls of Constantinople, now under Georgian guardianship, shall defy the onslaught of adversaries, becoming an impregnable bastion that inspires hope and preserves the Orthodox legacy for generations to come. The world watches with bated breath as this historic chapter unfolds."

Renowned for his unwavering spirit and exceptional leadership, he orchestrated a series of triumphs against formidable foes, defending the Georgian lands from relentless Persian and Ottoman invasions. Although somewhat controversial for his service to Safavids and Ottomans, a choice that drew criticism and divided opinions among his contemporaries, his experiences in the service of other powers have granted him a unique perspective and a wealth of knowledge. The time has come to honor this extraordinary figure. The question arises: How shall we pay tribute to Giorgi Saakadze's extraordinary legacy? Two paths lie before us:"

Regarded as a luminary of his time, Orbeliani's life and accomplishments have left an indelible mark on the tapestry of Georgian history. Orbeliani's written works, marked by their eloquence and depth, captured the essence of Georgian folklore, traditions, and the very soul of the nation. His masterful contributions to ethnography and folklore not only served as a testament to the richness of Georgian heritage but also played a pivotal role in preserving and revitalizing cultural identity during a time of external influences.

The political turmoil plaguing the central governance has not gone unnoticed, particularly by the Atabegs of Samtskhe. They gaze upon our weakened state with a newfound boldness, a defiant glint in their eyes. Discontent murmurs are growing into loud proclamations of dissatisfaction, as they condemn our unstable rule and their subjugation under it. Their loyalty, once unquestionable, now trembles on the edge of a sword, their yearning for autonomy threatening to spill over."

It is from none other than Demetrius, brother to our King Vakhtang. In his letter, he requests - or rather, demands - a substantial increase in autonomy for his lands, along with a long list of privileges for his local nobles. It is clear that Demetrius and his nobles are capitalizing on the weak state of our central rule and the uncertain future of King Vakhtang's line of succession. Their audacious demands ring with the clangor of ambition and a barely concealed desire to break away from the rule of the crown. The question now stands: How should we respond to this blatant challenge to our authority?"

Persia, a land rich in culture and resources, has been a historical battleground of great empires. It is time for us to make our mark on this land.

The formidable Turkmen confederation of Qara Qoyunlu has been repelled, and the glorious heartland of our forefathers is once again under Armenian control. This victory marks a significant chapter in our nation's storied history, signifying the rebirth of Great Armenia. Our triumphant troops march through the ancient cities and newly liberated territories, singing praises of freedom and brotherhood. With their courage and tenacity, they have reshaped the fate of Armenia, rekindling the spirit of Tigranes the Great, one of our nation's most celebrated rulers. Our people, once scattered and oppressed, now find themselves on the precipice of a new Golden Age.\n\nThe reunification of ancestral lands under one banner hails the dawn of a vibrant era for our nation, promising progress, prosperity, and enduring peace. It is now incumbent upon us to guide our people and harness this hard-won liberty, ensuring that the sacrifices made in this sacred struggle for independence do not go in vain. We stand on the shoulders of giants, who built the foundations of this land with their blood, sweat, and tears. Let us strive to rival the accomplishments of the heroes of our past and build a future worthy of their legacy. Great Armenia has been reborn, and its future is ours to shape!"

 flavor_arm.2.d:0 "The lands that once flourished under the stewardship of the Church of the East have been retaken by our mighty armies. As they march triumphantly through the ancient city gates of Baghdad, cheers echo through the arid landscapes, signaling a new era of Christian resurgence. The Armenian liberators, despite their differences with the Church of the East rooted in the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon, are proving that unity in the face of common adversity supersedes theological discrepancies.\n\nThe differences between our churches must be put aside, since the existential threats posed by the Islamic Sultanates require a unified Christian front. Even as differences in the interpretation of the nature of Christ persist, it is the emblem of the Cross that remains their shared rallying point. Our march to victory resonates with a deeper message: the power of the Cross knows no bounds, and the resolve of the faithful can lead to the most unexpected of victories. Let the Church of the East rise again, and may God guide our common path!"

As our brave forces triumph over the sundrenched plains and through the towering pyramids, a new dawn breaks for the region's forgotten community – the Copts. Once the predominant Christian group in Egypt, the Copts have long been marginalized, their religious freedom curtailed under Islamic rule. Now, with Armenian forces bringing these lands under their control, the bells of the Coptic Orthodox Church ring once again across the Nile, heralding the beginning of a Coptic Restoration.\n\nWe have come to the Copts' aid, emboldening them to reclaim their historical stature. Our victory over Egypt's previous rulers not only marks the expansion of our territories but also ushers in a renewed era of religious freedom and acceptance for the Coptic Christians. Let us celebrate this momentous occasion, for it not only signifies the expansion of our Empire but also the rebirth of a faith community that has endured centuries of trials and tribulations. As we look towards the future, we must remember to uphold the principles of diversity and inclusivity that have paved the way for this historic Coptic Restoration."

Amongst them, the Seljuk dynasty shone as a beacon of greatness, governing with wisdom and valor. Centuries later, fate has bestowed upon us the opportunity to reclaim the legacy of our esteemed predecessors and unite the fragmented lands of Iran under our rule. For far too long, the usurpers of the Timurid dynasty have plagued these lands, sowing discord and chaos. But we, the rightful successors of the Seljuk bloodline, have risen to the occasion and dethroned these interlopers. Now, with Iran under our dominion, we are tasked with the responsibility of revitalizing a land ravaged by Mongol and Timurid raids, which have left Iran in a state of depopulation and internal division. If we are to become the true legitimate rulers of Persia, we must strive to mend these wounds so that we may shape history and leave a lasting mark on the land, just like our predecessors did."

Guided by the genius of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, an esteemed polymath and astronomer, the observatory became a haven for scholars from far and wide. However, the ravages of time and the ebb and flow of empires conspired to cast a shadow over this beacon of knowledge. Neglect and conflict marred its once-majestic halls, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. But fret not, for our enlightened reign shall herald a renaissance for the Maragheh Observatory. Under our guidance, the observatory will be meticulously restored to its former grandeur. Walls once worn by centuries of neglect shall be repaired, and the celestial instruments that once guided the gaze of scholars shall be revived. A select group of astronomers, mathematicians, and cartographers will be invited from across our realm to revive the spirit of inquiry that once thrived within these walls. The restored Maragheh Observatory shall serve as a center of astronomical research and intellectual discourse, attracting brilliant minds from far and wide. Our kingdom will bask in the glory of their discoveries, as they unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and illuminate the darkest corners of the night sky.

The region, ripe with wealth and brimming with strategic importance, is now to be passed on to his son, Fulad Mirza, in accordance with local customs and traditions. Yet, our sovereign Jahan Shah has grand visions of a centralized realm, a singular, powerful entity united under his command. The existence of a semi-autonomous Emirate in the heart of his dominions, especially one as influential as Baghdad, could prove a thorn in his side, an unwelcome obstacle to his aspirations.\n\nTo deal with this delicate matter, we now have to make a crucial decision. We could choose to douse the embers of local rule by force, abolishing the Emirate of Baghdad, and integrating it directly into the heart of our realm. This would undoubtedly strengthen our central power, but it may also provoke the ire of other local lords and risk internal strife. Alternatively, we might seek a more peaceful route, finding diplomatic or familial ties to slowly draw the Emirate closer to our own domain without risking open conflict. This choice may buy us time and avoid immediate unrest, but leaves the question if a stable and loyal realm can be achieved without a show of force. This decision will undeniably shape the future of our realm. The sands of time have begun to pour, and we must choose our path, and soon."

 flavor_turkoman.10.d:0 "In the quiet town of Argavand, a beacon of our glorious past stands proudly yet weathered, the Mausoleum of Turkmen Emirs. This site holds the mortal remains of our former rulers, etched in the annals of time, it echoes tales of our rich history and the relentless spirit of our people. However, years of conflict and neglect have seen this once-grand mausoleum fall into a state of decay. Recently, a resurgence of cultural pride and a desire to commemorate our heritage has led to calls for the restoration of the Mausoleum. Such a monumental effort could invigorate our people, demonstrating our commitment to honoring our past and preserving our legacy. But it also requires a considerable allocation of resources. Should we allocate funds and manpower to restore this monument to its former glory, or should we focus our attention on more pressing matters?"

This jewel, previously in the hands of our rivals Qara Qoyunlu, is not only rich in resources but holds a commanding position, situated at the crossroads of major trade routes. Known for its economic vitality and cultural significance, Tabriz offers a strategic advantage that our current capital cannot. Its advanced infrastructure, booming marketplace, and fortified location make it an ideal seat of power for our growing empire. As we stand in the heart of this vibrant city, we must ponder whether to move our capital here, embracing the opportunities and wealth it promises, or continue to govern from our historical seat. A change of this magnitude is not to be taken lightly; it can redefine our future."

 flavor_turkoman.12.d:0 "The Emir of Baghdad, Ispend bin Yusuf, brother of our esteemed ruler Jahan Shah, established this enclave in 1431 following the destruction of the Jalayirid Sultanate. Since its inception, Mesopotamia has thrived under his autonomous rule, growing into a bastion of power and influence. However, the time has come to reevaluate the situation, for unchecked autonomy could pave the way for unforeseen challenges and threats to the throne. As reports of the Emir's increasing influence and power reach the royal court, a growing concern takes root. While Mesopotamia's flourishing state is a testament to the Emir's prowess, allowing him to further solidify his position may lead to ambitions beyond the region's borders. The prospect of a potent rival on our very doorstep cannot be ignored."
 flavor_turkoman.12.a:0 "We must deal with this urgent matter."

 flavor_mam.103.t:0 "The Administration of the Mamluk Domain"
 flavor_mam.103.d:0 "We stand at an important crossroads in our history. Many of our advisors support the idea of a new state, modernized and a true rival to the strongest powers of Europe.

While some advocated for studying and learning from the Ethiopian administration for potential insights into governance, others saw the military prowess of the Ethiopian forces as a valuable lesson. The potential acquisition of knowledge from Ethiopian administrative practices held appeal due to their long-standing history and cultural nuances. Simultaneously, the formidable military strategies employed by the Ethiopians prompted a desire to glean insights into effective defensive tactics. Ultimately, the decision to engage in conquest or collaboration hinged on the balance between political aspirations and the pragmatic benefits of cross-cultural exchange."

His rise demonstrated the potential for local leadership to thrive even in challenging circumstances, offering a glimmer of hope and stability during an era of uncertainty. His legacy serves as a testament to the resilience and capabilities of Ethiopian nobility in the face of external pressures."

 flavor_mam.108.t:0 "The Many Capitals of the Ethiopians"
 flavor_mam.108.d:0 "The people of Ethiopia, despite being under our firm administration, are known to move their centers around.

 flavor_mam.111.t:0 "Administrating the Northern Territories"
 flavor_mam.111.d:0 "For the past few decades, chaos, neglect, and uprisings have gripped our Syrian territories.

 flavor_mam.113.b:0 "We will just perform maintenance."

 flavor_mam.114.t:0 "Architecture in Safavid Persia"
 flavor_mam.114.d:1 "Amidst the golden age of the Persian Empire during our century, a remarkable narrative of architectural splendor unfolds. Majestic domes and intricate tilework adorn the landscape, as the rulers of the persian people craft a unique architectural identity that melds their illustrious heritage with innovative designs. The dazzling turquoise and cobalt hues of Isfahan's Imam Mosque's mosaic tiles reflect a profound commitment to aesthetics. The Ali Qapu Palace rises in grandeur, its intricate calligraphy and delicate stucco work reflecting a society that cherishes the fusion of art and architecture. Amidst these structures, their royal line not only construct buildings but weave a narrative of cultural legacy, where architecture becomes a canvas upon which the empire's brilliance is etched for posterity."
