 integrated_byz_events.1.t: "The Palaiologan Renaissance"
 integrated_byz_events.1.d: "During the reign of the Palaiologos Dynasty, the Byzantines began rediscovering classical art and literature from the remnants of Ancient Greece and Rome. However, the Byzantine Empire did not have the treasury to support these freethinkers, leaving their innovation doing no good. As such, many of these freethinkers fled Constantinople upon Turkish conquest in 1453, greatly helping in the birth of the Renaissance in Italy."

 integrated_byz_events.3.d: "Hello there! Before you seat yourself in the Imperial Throne, crowning yourself the new Basileus/Basilissa of the remnants of the Roman Empire and attempting its restoration, I'd like to thank you for using this mod! Herein lies many features that are intent on enhancing your gameplay experience as Byzantium, to update the Purple Phoenix DLC to current vanilla standards and attempt to explore what could have been, had Byzantium survived the Ottoman onslaught. \n\nNow, the only reason why this event shows up is because, due to popular (or unpopular but vocal) opinion, the events in the mod "Byzantium Events" that have previously been integrated into this mod have been asked to be provided as is, without my modifications. Reasons why ranges from not liking my particular content to preferring how much easier the earlygame gets with the unmodified events. As such, I have opted to include these events for you to decide whether you want the modified (Recommended) versions, or if you want the events as they are. \n\nTo give an explanation what this means, essentially if you pick my modified version, you'll get a fully compatible set of events that enhances the game for Byzantium while attempting not to stray far away from what you could expect to see in vanilla, had Paradox decided to like Byzantium just a little bit more. If you instead pick the unmodified version, be prepared that things will be considerably easier to the point of literally guaranteeing you will obliterate the Ottomans if you at least know how to play the game decently, as well as there being particular incompatibilities that may or may not hamper gameplay. Any bug or balance reports based on this version will not be taken into consideration. \n\nNow that you have been informed, your first decision as the new Basileus/Basilissa of the Roman Empire is to decide whether you want my take on how Byzantium should play, or whether you want the original mod's events."

He was very skilled at making supercannons, a new military technology that would change siege warfare forever. In 1452 he came to the court of Konstantinos XI and offered his services to the Emperor.

 integrated_byz_events.10.t: "Giovanni Giustiniani"
 integrated_byz_events.10.d: "Giovanni Giustiniani Longo was a young Genoese captain, a member of one of the greatest families of the Republic, a kinsman to the powerful house of Doria in Genoa, and protostrator of the Eastern Roman Empire. He led 700 professional soldiers, both Genovese and Greeks from the island of Chios, which at the time was part of the Republic of Genoa, to the defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman army of Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. He personally financed, organized and led this expedition on his own initiative, and upon arriving was placed in command of the land defenses by Emperor Konstantinos XI Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire. Giustiniani was key in controlling the land forces and keeping the Greeks, Genoese and Venetians from arguing with each other, and instead kept focused on repairing the land walls after the Ottoman cannon had shot holes in them. It was at least partly because of Giustiniani's charisma that the Byzantine forces were able to hold out so long against overwhelming odds. On May 29, 1453, during the final attack by Mehmet II, Giustiniani was wounded by an Ottoman cannon while defending the walls of Constantinople. Some sources say the wound was caused by a crossbow bolt. Sources disagree about whether the wound was to his arm, leg, or chest, but it forced him to withdraw from his station at the land wall. He exited through the locked gate into the city, which opened up the opportunity for the fearful to flee, and panic spread throughout the lines. Seeing the demoralization caused among the defenders by Giustiniani's retreat, Sultan Mehmed II ordered a renewed assault that eventually defeated the Byzantines and Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Although Giustiniani's men managed to escape with their general after its fall, Giustiniani died from his wounds in the 1st of June 1453."

 integrated_byz_events.11.t: "Theodosian Walls"
 integrated_byz_events.11.d: "The Theodosian Walls were without a doubt among the most important defensive systems of Late Antiquity. For a thousand years they have held off invaders threatening the Roman Empire. Indeed, they were perhaps the most successful and influential city walls ever built – they allowed the city and its emperors to survive and thrive for more than a millennium, against all strategic logic, on the edge of an extremely unstable and dangerous world... With the advent of siege cannons, however, the fortifications became obsolete, but their massive size still provided effective defense, as demonstrated during the Second Ottoman Siege in 1422. In the final siege, which led to the fall of the city to the Ottomans in 1453, the defenders, severely outnumbered, still managed to repeatedly counter Turkish attempts at undermining the walls, repulse several frontal attacks, and restore the damage from the siege cannons for almost two months. Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general Giovanni Giustiniani was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken. After the capture of the city, Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects, and they were kept in repair during the first centuries of Ottoman rule. \n As cannons are becoming ever so common, the walls at this point are no longer practical and remain only for ceremonial purposes."

 integrated_byz_events.16.t: "Demetrios Palaiologos"
 #This was seriously a copy-paste from the Wikipedia page. There were even footnotes in the text!! What the hell!
 integrated_byz_events.16.d: "Demetrios Palaiologos was born in around 1407 as the fifth son of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, younger brother to John VIII and Constantine XI. He had very high ambitions within the Empire despite being fifth son, which lead to great conflict in the imperial family. He was granted the court title of despot in accordance with standard practice. Despite then receiving possession of the island of Lemnos from his father in 1422, he refused to live there and fled to the court of King Sigismund of Hungary. He however returned to Constantinople some years later. Demetrios lost his possession of Lemnos in 1440 as he prematurely left from the Council of Florence to Constantinople due to being declared an enemy of the Union. Instead, he was granted appanage of more distant Mesembria, from which he staged a coup and sieged Constantinople with support from the Ottomans. He was then imprisoned in Selymbria for a brief period of time. As Emperor John VIII died, he exploited his proximity to Constantinople by attempting to seize the throne from Constantine, then ruling in distant Morea. Unlike his brothers, Demetrios was an anti-unionist, which helped him secure some popularity, however thanks to Manuel's wife and the brothers' mother Helena Dragaš, Constantine's ascendance to the throne was secured. He finally ended up as governor of Morea together with the final brother Thomas, which he ruled until its conquest."

 integrated_byz_events.27.t: "Loukas Notaras"
 integrated_byz_events.27.d: "Loukas Notaras (5 April 1402 - 3 June 1453) was the last Megas Doux of the Byzantine Empire. This position (literally Grand Duke, but more appropriately Lord High Admiral) had been expanded under the late Palaiologid emperors and functioned as an unofficial Prime Minister, overseeing the Imperial Bureaucracy in place of the Megas Logothetes who had previously exercised this function. In 1424, Notaras was one of three emissaries—along with Manuel Melachrenos and George Sphrantzes—who negotiated a treaty of friendship between Emperor John VII Palaiologos and Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Turks at the end of the Ottoman Interregnum. His continued importance as an imperial official is attested by his presence at the marriage of the future Emperor Constantine Palaiologos to Caterina Gattilusio 27 July 1441. During the siege of Constantinople, Notaras led the troops along the north-western Sea Wall. Some accounts of the siege have him deserting his post after the Ottoman banner was raised on the tower above the Kerkoporta; again, however, this may have been politically motivated slander. In any case, he was able to hold the Sea Wall—which had been the point of entry of all earlier successful attacks on the city—against the Turkish fleet until the breach along the Mesotechion rendered his efforts moot. Notaras, his Palaiologina wife and his son were all captured by the Turks and originally granted clemency in the name of reestablishing order and in exchange for much of Notaras's fortune, which he had had the sense to invest abroad in Venice in the form of dowries for his children. Nonetheless, he was executed shortly after along with his son and son-in-law."

Whether in Constantinople by Constantine XI, supervised and funded by Mehmed II, Prince Orhan, who described himself as a contender for the throne of the sultan Bayezid I, was actually a grandson, and thus belonged to the generation of Mehmed II's uncle, is unclear. When Mehmed II succeeded the Ottoman throne, Constantine responded by threatening to release Prince Orhan, who was a contender to the Ottoman throne, unless Mehmed met some of his demands. He committed suicide after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, suicide or was taken on the run and executed on behalf of Mehmed II."

 integrated_byz_events.40.d: "Georgius Gemistus, later called Plethon, was a Greek scholar of Neoplatonic philosophy. He was one of the chief pioneers of the revival of Greek learning in Western Europe. In Mistra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included Basilios Bessarion and George Scholarius (later to become Patriarch of Constantinople and Plethon's enemy). He was made chief magistrate by Theodore II. In 1415 and 1418 he wrote pamphlets to Theodore and Manuel describing how the Empire could be reorganized according to Plato's Republic, with political, legal and economic reforms, and gained even greater reputation as a legal thinker, with rumors that he carried entire legal codes in his memory. In 1428 Gemistos was consulted by Emperor Ioannes VIII on the issue of unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power. He re-introduced Plato's thoughts to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 Council of Florence, a failed attempt to reconcile the East-West schism. Here Pletho met and influenced Cosimo de' Medici to found a new Platonic Academy, which, under Marsilio Ficino, would proceed to translate into Latin all Plato's works, the Enneads of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works. After his return to the Peloponnese, Gemistos founded a school. He taught polytheism as opposed to monotheism, and some of his students prayed to statues of the pagan deities. He died in 1454."

 integrated_byz_events.46.t: "The Hexamilion Wall"
 integrated_byz_events.46.d: "The Hexamilion wall is a defensive wall constructed across the Isthmus of Corinth guarding the only land route into the Peloponnese peninsula from mainland Greece. The wall was constructed in the period between 408 AD and 450 AD, in the reign of Theodosius II during the time of the great Barbarian invasions into the Roman Empire. The attack of Alaric on Greece in 396 AD or the sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths may have motivated the construction, which included towers, sea bastions, and at minimum one fortress. The one known fortress contained two gates (north and south), of which the northern gate functioned as the formal entrance to the Peloponessos. The wall was constructed with a rubble and mortar core faced with squared stones. It is not certain how long it took to complete, but the importance given to the task is apparent from the scale of the construction; the Hexamilion is the largest archaeological structure in Greece. Every structure in the region was cannibalized for stone for the effort, either being incorporated into the wall directly, as was the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia, or being burned into lime, as was the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora as well as much of the ancient statuary of Corinth. In the reign of Justinian, the wall was fortified with additional towers, reaching a total number of 153. Military use appears to have fallen off after the 7th century AD, and by the 11th AD domestic structures were being built into the wall. In 1415, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II personally supervised repairs over a period of forty days. The high cost of this effort caused unrest among the local elite. The wall was breached in 1423 and again in 1431 by the Ottomans under the command of Turahan Bey. Despot Constantine Palaiologos restored the wall again in 1444, but the Turks breached it again in 1446 and in October 1452. After the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese in 1460, the wall was abandoned. During its history, the wall never succeeded in fulfilling the function for which it was constructed, unless it acted as a deterrent. Elements of the wall are preserved south of the Corinth Canal and at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia."

 integrated_byz_events.47.t: "Helena Palaiologina, Queen Consort of Cyprus"
 integrated_byz_events.47.d: "Helena Palaiologina (3 February 1428 – 11 April 1458) was a Byzantine princess of the Palaiologos family, who became the Queen consort of Cyprus and Armenia, titular Queen consort of Jerusalem, and Princess of Antioch through her marriage to King John II of Cyprus and Armenia. She was the mother of Queen Charlotte of Cyprus. Helena was largely responsible for the revival of Greek influence in Cyprus due to the numerous members of the Byzantine court who arrived in her wake and were given positions at the Lusignan court. This led to a renewal of ties with the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, she welcomed and gave assistance to many Byzantine refugees who had fled to Cyprus. She was described as having been "stronger in character than her husband". She took charge of the kingdom, and her policies in favor of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture enraged the Franks who looked upon her as a dangerous enemy; however she had become far too powerful for them to attack.  Pope Pius II also condemned her for supporting the Orthodox Church, and her endowment of 15,000 ducats per annum to the monastery of Saint George of Mangana also drew much criticism as it was considered to have been "extravagant generosity in impoverished times". The Greek Cypriots, on the other hand, had always revered Helena as a great heroine due to her bold, decisive character in looking after their interests. In 1457, she poisoned her son-in-law, Infante John of Portugal, who had given his support to the Catholic party, thus incurring her wrath and enmity; also she wished for her daughter to marry Louis of Savoy. This second marriage Helena did arrange for her daughter, Charlotte; however, the marriage between Charlotte and Louis took place in 1459, when Helena and King John were both dead, and Charlotte by that time had succeeded her father as Queen Regnant of Cyprus. Helena died on 11 April 1458 in the fortress of Nicosia where she and King John had barricaded themselves during the insurrection of his illegitimate son, James. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic's. John died the same year, and was succeeded by his only surviving legitimate child, Charlotte."

She died while giving birth to a stillborn daughter in November 1429. His second marriage was on 27 July 1441 to Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino of Lesbos, who died in August 1442 after suffering a miscarriage. He had no children by either marriage. After his coronation in 1449, Constantine XI sent a commission under George Sphrantzes asking Mara Brankovic, daughter of the Serbian Despot Ðurad Brankovic and Byzantine princess Irene Kantakouzene, to marry him. By then Mara was the widow of Murad II; she had been allowed to return to her parents in Serbia after the death of Murad. The proposal was welcomed by her father Ðurad Brankovic, but it foundered on the objection of Mara herself who had vowed that 'if God ever released her from the hands of the infidel she would lead a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her days'. Accordingly, the courtship failed and Sphrantzes took steps to arrange for a marriage with a princess either from the Empire of Trebizond or the Kingdom of Georgia. The choice eventually fell to an unnamed Georgian princess, daughter of George VIII. He started official negotiations with the Georgian king, who had sent an ambassador to Constantinople for that reason. It was agreed that the next spring, Sphrantzes would sail for Georgia to bring the bride to Constantinople, but Constantine's plans were overtaken by the events of 1453."
