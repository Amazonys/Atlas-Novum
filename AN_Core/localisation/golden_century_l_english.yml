But he must also command the respect of his crew, and at least in theory commands the ship with their consent.\n\nCaptain [Root.captain_name.GetName] of the [Root.GetRandomShipName] has gained for themselves a cruel and tyrannical reputation.

Our smugglers make their profits by purchasing stolen goods from pirate crews and selling them on for profit in legitimate markets. To sell these illegally acquired goods the smugglers must bribe port officials to ignore their origin or else present passable documents that proclaim their legitimacy.\n\n[Root.skilled_forger.GetName], a skilled forger, has recently entered our service and procured for us a number of documents that should be accepted in almost any port, ensuring that our operations will continue to run smoothly."

 pirates.14.d:0 "The privateer Captain [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has made quite a name for himself in the service of the [privateer_origin_country.GetAdjective] Navy. The payment he has been receiving for his prizes however is much less than the full value of the prizes themselves. Like many savvy privateers, [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has realized that he could make a greater profit by turning pirate. He has tossed his Letter of Marque overboard and made port in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].

Many among our crews have experienced the horrors of slavery for themselves, and naturally their first instinct was to demand that the slaves be freed and incorporated into the crew.\n\nThe less scrupulous crewmen with a particular lust for gold would prefer to instead treat these people as cargo and sell them on to the fence as such. There will be nothing in the way of moneyed compensation for their efforts to take this prize, they argue, if we refuse to profit from trading in slaves."

 pirates.16.d:0 "It is time once again to careen the ships. This arduous process requires the crews to drag the ships onto a secure beach at high tide and safely lower them onto their sides to expose the hull for repairs. It is a task dreaded by every pirate, not only because the risk of damage to the ship and injury to the crew is high but because of the backbreaking labor they must perform to see the job done right. Several advocates among the crew feel that a more relaxed approach should be taken to careening, despite the captain’s insistence that failing to make the proper repairs will cause far more problems down the line."

Elected by the crew, he is expected to be their representative and to champion their needs against the often arbitrary authority of the captain.\n\nTwo candidates immediately present themselves. [Root.crew_representative.GetName] is a true advocate for the crew; he has both the humility to listen to their concerns and the fortitude to stand up to the captain. Meanwhile, [Root.captains_puppet.GetName] is firmly in the Captain’s pocket; he is skilled at manipulating the crew into believing that the Captain’s wishes are also their own.

Though they have an excellent record of delivering prizes, as soon as they make port their drunkenness and violence cause so much damage and disruption in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] that many wonder if they are worth the trouble they cause.\n\n After a particularly destructive episode, the local smuggling consortium has decided to blacklist the entire crew, making them unable to sell their plunder anywhere in [Root.GetName]. This has caused upset among the pirates that call the island home; they believe their natural rights to live as they please are being violated, and several rabble-rousers compare the smugglers to snobbish aristocrats."

 expel_minority_events.2.d:0 "Our expulsion of the heathens in [expelling_province.GetName] was never meant to go beyond the borders of the province, but religious communities are not so clearly delineated in their geography. Families, friends and other people with ties to those leaving in the neighboring province of [heathen_neighbors_moving.GetName] are now moving as well, trying to keep the community intact even as they are forced out of [Root.GetName]. This migration was not part of the plan, but it may serve our interests."
 expel_minority_events.2.a:0 "Let them leave. This was our goal from the start."
 expel_minority_events.2.b:0 "Stop this. We need them where they are."
 expel_minority_events.3.t:0 "The Last [expelling_province.Culture.GetName] in [Root.GetName]"
 expel_minority_events.3.d:0 "The [expelling_province.Religion.GetName] [expelling_province.Culture.GetName] people of [expelling_province.GetName] have long felt singled out in [Root.GetAdjective] society, being both a cultural and a religious minority. Now, they are being cast out of the only place they have left - [expelling_province.GetName].\n\nSeeing no future in [expelling_province.GetName], their presence here is increasingly threatened. Many now fear the repercussions of staying too long in such a hostile environment. Rather than the controlled migration we had hoped for, they are leaving rapidly, no one wanting to be the last ones left here."
 expel_minority_events.3.a:0 "Not quite how we had planned this."
 expel_minority_events.4.t:0 "[expelling_province.Culture.GetName] Refugees Flee [expelling_province.GetName]"
 expel_minority_events.4.d:0 "While most of the [expelling_province.Culture.GetName] population is complying with our efforts to move them to our colony in [expelling_colony.GetName], some have been searching for a way out of this situation. Fleeing to neighboring province is one way, since [expelling_province.GetName] is the primary target of our efforts.\n\nWhile this is clearly an attempt to interfere with our plan, trying to stop people from settling nearby will not mean that they comply with the original plan. More likely, they will scatter elsewhere, bringing the situation even further from our control."
 expel_minority_events.4.a:0 "At least this way, we know where they are going."
 expel_minority_events.4.b:0 "Such attempts at defiance will not be tolerated!"
 expel_minority_events.5.t:0 "Administrative Officials Expelled"
 expel_minority_events.5.d:0 "The people being moved to our colony in [expelling_colony.GetName] from [expelling_province.GetName] are not only commonfolk. Many of them have served important roles in administering [expelling_province.GetName], sometimes as a bridge between [Root.GetAdjective] leaders and the locals. Now that they are being expelled, the province will be more difficult to manage, forcing us to make some concessions. Either we take a more off-hands approach to administering [expelling_province.GetName] until the positions can be filled, or we hurry along our plans to have less people to manage."
 expel_minority_events.5.a:0 "The positions will have to be vacant for the time being."
 expel_minority_events.5.b:0 "We'll simply have to send people abroad at a faster rate."
