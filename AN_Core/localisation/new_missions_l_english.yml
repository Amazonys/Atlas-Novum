Relying on the loyalty of just our co-religionists have therefore always been out of the question. We must instead promote religious discussion and debate so that any differences can be settled in a more peaceful manner.\nLet us build a new capital, near the great city of Agra, a wonder of Mughal architecture to display the full glory of our dynasty, but also designed to hold the many faiths of our empire. A specifically created house of worship for religious debates between Jains, Hindus, Christians, Zoroastrians and any other faith within our borders will allow us to fully explore the spiritual world."
