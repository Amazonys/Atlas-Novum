However, the Romans discovered her role in the persecution and was executed by the Romans in the year 304.\nSaint Ulrich on the other hand has a lesser role in Christian faith, but was a great leader of our city.

On the 25th of September 1555, Karl signed the Augsburger Reichs- und Religionsfrieden - the imperial and religious peace treaty, which provided religious unity within the state. While it did not give the Protestants the full religious freedom nor prevent the Thirty Years' War of 1618, it at least is the pioneer of the peace treaty which will be known as the Westfälischer Friede - the Peace of Westphalia."

Our forefathers decided to permit only three different coins as currency, namely the Turnose, the Heller and the Brabantian Loven. However, the systems we had in place for exchanging currency have been placed under increasing strain, and not enough legitimate currency is available, allowing criminals to commit massive acts of fraud.

 fraternite_reform_desc:0 "Not everyone acknowledges the ideals of Fraternité as an ideal of the Revolution, but view it as a reactionary element within our own state who wish to return to the old government. Fraternité is a sense of brotherhood and those who follow its principles believe that the state should follow an authoritarian route where there is a proper place for all citizens assigned by the state."
 legislative_assembly_reform:0 "Legislative Assembly"
 legislative_assembly_reform_desc:0 "With the collapse of the old government, we have an opportunity to reconstruct a new legislative government which treats all people, regardless of social class, as equals. This government shall be absolutely committed to the ideals of the Revolution, and will not suffer those who wish to subjugate us back into the old regime."
 national_constituent_reform:0 "Constituent Assembly"
 national_constituent_reform_desc:0 "The Constituent Assembly was a rough outline of democracy provided by the old government that governed the people in three distinct constituents. By building and expanding upon the old government rather than overhauling it with the new, we may prove to the reactionary governments on our border that we are still a civilized nation and a force for good in this changing world."
 feuillant_reform:0 "The Feuillant System"
 feuillant_reform_desc:0 "There are many citizens and politicians in the Republic who wish to return to the tyranny of an absolute monarchy. However, the Feuillant political group believe in a compromise; that powers in the nation should be split between an Emperor and a President, similar to a constitutional monarchy. By riding the delicate balance between Empire and Republic, we may actually please both the Imperialists and Republicans within our nation."
 two_chamber_reform:0 "The Two-Chamber System"
 two_chamber_reform_desc:0 "For a long time, the Canton system maintained the peace, stability, and independence of small democratic leagues like the Swiss and Swabian Federations. By similarly dividing our legislature into a Grand Council representing the Cantons, and the Senate representing the republic as a whole, we may protect the interests of the individual cities and cultural identities within our nation while still placing the values of the Revolution above all else!"
 absolute_president_reform:0 "Absolute Power of the President"
 absolute_president_reform_desc:0 "While we have members of our nation elected to represent the people of their constituency, we must never forget that it is the President who has been elected to represent all people. The role of the elected representatives within the Revolution should be merely to advise the President who wields absolute power over the Republic."
 revolutionary_council_reform:0 "A Revolutionary Council"
 revolutionary_council_reform_desc:0 "It’s become clear that the cult of personality surrounding our ruler is rapidly returning us to the old ways of government. We cannot allow this to happen, so by concentrating power into a council of elected individuals to represent the values of the Revolution, we strip power away from the individual at our state’s head and create another shield against the horror of absolute rulership."
 revolutionary_principle_reform:0 "Revolutionary Principle"
 revolutionary_principle_reform_desc:0 "The purpose of our state is quite simple; to spread the Revolution. We must centralise our state around the idea that it is only be liberating all people of the world into Revolutionary states that we may create an everlasting state of peace and equality in the world."
 equality_principle_reform:0 "Equality Principle"
 equality_principle_reform_desc:0 "Although our state holds Egalité as one of its core values, it is clear that we have completely failed in our goal to treat all our people with fairness and equality. The core principle of our nation must be to eliminate the barriers of gender, culture, and social class and ensure that it is known that all people are created equal and a good start to that would be to ensure that religion remains a private matter and does not dictate one’s rights within the state."
 imperial_principle_reform:0 "Imperial Principle"
 imperial_principle_reform_desc:0 "The Revolution has made it clear that our nation, above all others, wields the divine right to hold Imperial Hegemony over all other nations. The states around us are fragile and weak, and it is clear that only by directly controlling these states ourselves will we ensure that the values of the Revolution are enforced on the people."
 equal_electorate_reform:0 "Equal Electorate"
 equal_electorate_reform_desc:0 "We must dissolve all barriers that separate our people and extend the right to hold a political office to all people. Gender, religion, social class, culture, all are irrelevant to one’s capability to hold a political office and so we must strive to maintain equality of opportunity within our government."
 three_classes_reform:0 "Three Social Classes"
 three_classes_reform_desc:0 "In the days before the birth of the Revolution, the old government attempted to sway the people away from taking arms by allowing three social classes representation within the government; the clergy, the peasants, and the upper class. Perhaps we could emulate this system by organizing our people into an upper, middle, and lower class based on their economic status and creating three distinct political entities within our government to represent their interests."
 military_electorate_reform:0 "Military Electorate"
 military_electorate_reform_desc:0 "Our nation values comradery above all else, and nobody exemplifies the value of being a comrade like our boys fighting on the fields of battle. These are the men who’ve seen the horrors of war and fought alongside their countrymen to preserve and advance the Revolution, and these men should be the ones to rule us. We must alter the requirements to hold an office in our government so that only those who have served in our military are eligible to represent the people within the government."
 president_for_life_reform:0 "President For Life"
 president_for_life_reform_desc:0 "Though many Revolutionary politicians are supporting the idea of a Revolutionary Empire with a hereditary ruler at its head, others are fiercely resisting this idea and claiming that it betrays the very ideals of the Revolution itself. The President is sovereign, and none may supersede the authority of the Presidency. By electing our Presidents to rule for life, we will both secure the absolute leadership the Imperialists demand without completely abandoning the ideals of the Republic."

 government_for_people_reform_desc:0 "Egalité, Fraternité, Liberté. All three virtues of the Republic point to one thing; that the Republic exists to serve its people, and for no other reason.

 become_rev_empire_reform_desc:0 "Even in a Republic fueled by the fires of Revolution, it’s becoming clear that political dynasties are being established in our nation.

 legion_of_honor_reform_desc:1 "Now that we have reorganized the revolution into a hereditary Empire, we must enlist our most famous contrymen to legitimize our Imperial rule. The Legion of Honor shall be an order of Knights, Officers, and Commanders granted positions of great prestige by the Imperial Court."
 imperial_nobility_reform:0 "Nobility of the Emperor"
 imperial_nobility_reform_desc:0 "With the majority of the old Nobility of our nation now buried headless in mass graves, the time has come to re-establish our Nobility in a structure more amiable to the Empire’s goals. By assigning noble titles almost entirely to loyalists and members of the Imperial family, we will ensure that the Nobility will never act outside of the interests of the Crown."
 imperial_decree_reform:0 "Imperial Decree"
 imperial_decree_reform_desc:0 "The Emperor rules supreme in this nation and disloyalty to the Emperor is equivalent to disloyalty to the Revolution. All decrees issued by the Empire are of course done so in the interest of the people, the Revolution, and the Empire, and disloyalty shall not go unpunished."
 consulate_reform:0 "A Loyal Consulate"
 consulate_reform_desc:0 "With the fall of the republican government within the Revolution, it soon became clear that a new system was necessary to continue the spread of the revolution. The Consulate filled that void, and perhaps by advancing the powers of the Consulate and liberally dismissing any who object to the Emperor’s rule we will solidify our grasp on all of our Imperial holdings."
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform:0 "Emperor of the Revolution"
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform_desc:0 "Our state is the home of the Revolution, and our Emperor is its head. It is only natural then that we coronate our Emperor as the Emperor of all those loyal to the Revolution and rally the people around his divine cause."
 enlightened_monarchy_reform:0 "An Enlightened Monarchy"
 enlightened_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "The ideals of the Enlightenment are the very foundation for Revolutionary thought, and as long as our Emperor does not truly embrace the ideals of the Enlightenment then he does not represent the values of the Revolution. Many would say a hereditary monarchy itself betrays the ideals of the Revolution, but a combination of an absolute monarch and Enlightenment thought shall ensure that none can oppose the ideals of our state."
 become_rev_republic_reform:0 "Return to the Revolutionary Republic"
 become_rev_republic_reform_desc:0 "The Empire has served its purpose of advancing the needs of the people through an absolute government. Now that our mission is complete, we should hand our powers back to the people we have fought so hard to liberate and allow them to choose their own destiny."
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform:0 "Disperse Power Across the Cities"
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform_desc:0 "Our government is a strange mix between a Republic, an Oligarchy, and a Monarchy. Trade and commerce are our primary concern and we’re not interested in building a global empire, only making an empire of trade. If we shatter powers in our nation and grant greater control to the Trade Cities, we shall make our trade league much more inviting for the smaller powers who only desire the freedom and economic stability that we can provide."
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform:0 "Consolidate Power in the Doge"
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform_desc:0 "For years, our Republic has had its power base divided between the Doge, the Council of Ten, the citizens, and countless other legislative bodies. Each are subject to each other, but the Doge sits at the top of the hierarchy. Our loose government system has been useful thus far in advancing our trade efforts, but as our nation expands across the world, it’s become clear that we must grant the Doge executive powers across all branches of the government if we are to eliminate corruption in our administration."

We wish not to bloody our soil with the blood of foreign men, and to instead allow foreign men to bloody each other while we collect the profits. As such, it is vital that the Cantons within our nation are able to maintain positive relations with all nearby nations. However, this decentralized style of rule may prove difficult to maintain as our nation expands."
 ttl_gods_house:0 "The League of God's House"
 ttl_gods_house_desc:0 "God's House is a league of powerful bishops and Cantons united in their goal to resist the Bishopric of Chur and the rising power of the Habsburg princes within our nation. The primary concern of this league is to ensure that the Cantons remain out of Habsburg hands and stays faithful to the one true word of God."
 ttl_grey_league:0 "The Grey League"
 ttl_grey_league_desc:0 "This league was born out of conflict and strove to mitigate and end it wherever possible. The league was formed when many of the nearby counts, barons, and bishops began to grow increasingly hostile. The Grey League brought an end to these hostilities and continues to keep all Cantons within it out of direct conflict with foreign powers."
 ttl_league_of_ten:0 "The League of Ten"
 ttl_league_of_ten_desc:0 "When the dynasty of Toggenburg became extinct, the ten districts of Toggenburg united together into a single league so that they may continue to enjoy their independence. The League of Ten joined the Three Leagues so they would not be forced back into the servitude of a Count, hence the spirit of our independent way of life lives most vibrantly in The League of Ten."
 ttl_independent_cities:0 "Independent Cities"
 ttl_independent_cities_desc:0 "The Three Leagues is not a nation; rather it is a federation of cities, bishoprics, and Cantons united together in their desire to remain independent. As such, the league itself demands very little in form of tribute from its member states, but equally the member states expect little contribution back."
 ttl_economic_league:0 "An Economic League"
 ttl_economic_league_desc:0 "As well as coming together in times of war, the Three Leagues also met to secure their economic co-operation as well. By coordinating mercenary contracts in times of war and trade agreements in times of peace, the leagues were able to maximize profit whether the world around them was prospering in peace or burning in war."
 ttl_expanding_league:0 "Expanding the Leagues"
 ttl_expanding_league_desc:0 "It has become clear that our way of life is greatly threatened by the other powers in Europe. Our independence and neutrality will not be respected if we do not have the power to enforce it. It is only by expanding the league to include more independent nations that we may continue to enjoy our shared autonomy."
 teutonic_legacy:0 "Legacy of the Teutonic Knights"
 teutonic_legacy_desc:0 "Though our state is fully secularized now, we must never forget that it was built on the remains of the Teutonic Order. These knights, united in their faith, established themselves here in Prussia to defend the Christian world from the barbaric pagans to the East, and we too should make it our duty to spread the reformation to all corners of our nation and become united in the true teachings of Christ!"
 soldier_king:0 "The Soldier-King of Prussia"
 soldier_king_desc:0 "Most states are countries that have an army, Prussia on the other hand is an army that has a country.

This Northern March eventually evolved into Brandenburg; one of the most prosperous regions in the Empire. It is only due to the fortitude of our soldiers that we were able to tame and secure this land of savages."

 bra_pomeranian_wars_desc:0 "Throughout the entire medieval era, the Margraves of Brandenburg and the Dukes of Pomerania found themselves in constant war for control of the region.

 seat_of_the_old_emperors_desc:0 "Before Habsburg rule, the empire was truly diverse in the families it elected, and Brandenburg was often a great prize handed out to talented princes of these royal lines. Brandenburg represents the old ways, and perhaps we may one day use our position to restore the ideals of the Holy Roman Empire."
 iron_tooth:0 "Iron Tooth"
 iron_tooth_desc:0 "In his thirty years as Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick II earned the nickname "Iron Tooth" for both his iron will in the face of rebellious nobles and towns, but also for his fortitude in the Pomeranian Wars. His rule left a mark on our nation, a mark which instills a sense of pride and loyalty in even the lowliest peasant in Brandenburg."
 margrave_council:0 "Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark"
 margrave_council_desc:0 "The power of the Margrave is greatly threatened by the ever-increasing power of our Estates. The Estates are of great benefit to our nation, but the very real threat they represent to our base of power necessitates the creation of a new council, one which reduces the very real power that the estates hold over our nation into more of an advisory position for the Margrave. This way, we may continue to exploit the benefits of our Estates while needing to worry little about their needs."

The original version of the council was the "Council of Two Hundred" which had two hundred seats and governed the country in a loose and indirect way. This autonomous style of government has been respected and maintained whether Geneva has been independent, ruled under a monarchy, or a member of the Swiss Federation and our autonomy has brought great prosperity to Geneva itself."

Who better exemplifies the values of the Reformed Church than Geneva?"
 gnv_spiritual_leader:0 "Spiritual Leader of Geneva"
 gnv_spiritual_leader_desc:0 "As Calvin's influence in Geneva grew, the Grand Council created and gave him the title of "Spiritual Leader".

 gnv_calvins_laws:0 "Calvin's Laws"

 gnv_unconquerable_city_desc:0 "The history of Geneva is characterized in part by the endless efforts of the dukes of Savoy to subdue our city. We hold our independence strong against the would-be tyrants of Savoy, and the Grand Council will continue to refuse and resist the efforts of Savoy to subjugate our city under feudal rule.

 FER_resisting_venice:0 "Resisting Venetian Control"
 FER_resisting_venice_desc:0 "The Venetians hold an iron grip on the trade of Eastern Italy, and as such we find ourselves in near-constant strife with the republic.

 FER_ferraran_arsenal_desc:0 "In Venice exists an arsenal designed purely to produce warships on mass. This is a crude and uncivilized method of warfare, and we in Ferrara understand that it is not the quantity of ships that shall win us the war; but the grandness of their designs.

The Ostrogoths were successful in their invasion of Perugia regardless, and the soldiers had the wise Herculanus's head removed from his body. Miraculously though, four days after his head had started to rot and decay, it was reunited with his body and Herculanus spent the rest of his days Christianizing the Ostrogothic Kingdom.

 MBZ_securing_countess_rule_desc:0 "After our Countess secured her rulership over Bregenz from her uncle, she faced yet more male resistance from her own husband; Wilhelm. Wilhelm asserted that as her husband, he should have as much right to the possessions of the county as the countess, and he spent lavishly from the treasury and wasted the tax money of the county on needless frivolities. With the support of the Montfort-Bregenz family, Elisabeth passed a new law that ensured that only the ruler of Bregenz, regardless of gender, would be able to spend from the royal treasury."

 MBZ_saint_gebhard_desc:2 "Son of the count of Bregenz, Saint Gebhard was canonized by Papal authorities due to his humanitarian work in the Bishopric of Constance, a Bavarian city on the opposite side of the lake to Bregenz. Gebhard insisted that the state should not confiscate the goods of bakers and craftsmen, and that it should instead be distributed to their successors, so that they may continue to grow wealthy and maintain the productivity of our nation."

 MBZ_shadow_of_pfander_desc:0 "Our nation is surrounded, with a lake on one side of the city, and the great mount Pfander on the other. Therefor, the city can only be entered from a few key areas and if we were to defend and fortify our borders, the shared bounty of the mountain and the lake would keep us safe from hostile invaders."

When the Romans colonized the area, the city that would become Bregenz was made into the naval capital of Lake Constance, and designated the Admiralty of the area. Perhaps if we one day reach the open seas, we may show the world just how powerful the Constance navy truly is."

As a long lineage of iron mining characterizes countless families in Goslar, and fathers train their sons to follow in their footsteps, we can see no end to the mining culture that has characterized our nation."
 GOS_kaiserpfalz:0 "Kaiserpfalz"
 GOS_kaiserpfalz_desc:0 "Though many Emperors now call Wien their home, there was a time when Goslar itself was the seat of the Emperor. Goslar was home to the very first imperial synod, where bishops and the Emperor decided the laws of religion that govern our lives. Even today the old Kaiserpfalz stands in the heart of our town; laying empty, waiting for the day when the Emperor once again calls Goslar his home. One day, perhaps our little Free City could once again be the seat of the Empire."

 GOS_city_rights_desc:0 "When the Emperor withdrew his control over the City, we became more dependent on trade and merchants to bring their riches to Northern Germany. As such, the bill of rights that governs our daily lives greatly favors the rights of merchants living in or passing through our town, and as such many of the Burgher class choose to make Goslar their home and bring their riches to our small town."

However, the concept of a city not governed by a monarch or royal family seems to be a foreign concept to uncivilized families like the Welfs as the continually make efforts to subjugate our city and take control of our precious iron mines. We have never fallen to this so-called "noble" family, and we shall not fall now!"
 GOS_the_leagues:0 "Joining the Leagues"

Meir von Rothenburg was a holy man born from a long line of Rabbis who became known as Maharam, meaning Our Teacher.

 ROT_beautiful_city_desc:0 "Our city has known much destruction and devastation over the years, and the old symbols of the monarchy have steadily crumbled to be replaced with symbols of our faith and our republican traditions. As such, castles have crumbled and been replaced with monasteries, and the homes in the heart of the city have been built by rich merchants more concerned with aesthetics than practicality. So beautiful is our city that many propose we simply stop building and enjoy the magnificence of Rothenburg as it is."

 ROT_end_of_the_line_desc:0 "Many other Free Cities in the Empire were made so due to some quirk in their governments leading to the Emperor seizing and abandoning control, but Rothenburg's line died out naturally, and for a few dark years, our city knew no ruler. We have never been directly held by the Emperor, and have always been a free and independent city in some way or another. It was Emperor Rudolf von Habsburg granted us our Free City status, and thus our free republican government has become inseparable from Rothenburg culture."

The legend states that the Count of Tilly had besieged our town and intended to burn it to the ground, but the city council attempted to sway him to mercy with a drink of three liters of wine. He scoffed, and demanded that if the mayor could finish the drink alone, he would spare the city. Our magnificent mayor had an iron gut and a will of steel and he finished the drink without even pausing for breath, and true to his word, the Count declared that the city was saved.

 ANH_castle:0 "Anhalt Castle"
 ANH_castle_desc:0 "Although our nation has long been protected by the mountains and rivers of our home, the terrain alone was not sufficient to protect us from invaders. In spite of our small size, Anhalt Keep was quickly transformed into Anhalt Castle, built in the Harz Mountains to protect our nation from any entering with malicious intent. It's the necessity of survival that motivates the swiftness of our builders, and if Anhalt is to continue to protect itself from subjugation, we must continue this tradition of cheap and rapid construction."

 ANH_schultheiss_desc:0 "One of the largest settlements in the Duchy of Anhalt is Dessau, which itself is governed autonomously by an individual selected by the Duke and elected by the people. Rulership in this style is common across Anhalt and guarantees that tax collection in our many towns and villages is carried out in an exact and expedient manner without embezzlement."

However, we have adopted a method of farming akin to American ranching, where the landowner is granted Crown lands on which to raise his cattle and horses. This method of ranching is adaptable to all conditions, and has made regions of the country that would usually be useless into productive vital components of the state."

 AUS_land_down_under_desc:0 "Oceania was the last continent to be discovered by the Europeans, and Australia is by far the largest singular landmass on the Oceanic continent. The creatures found in Australia were at one point considered so fantastical and otherworldly that many Europeans simply did not believe they could exist until they saw them with their own eyes. The unfamiliar nature of our wildlife and geography makes Australia deadly for invading armies. We were once foreigners to this land as well, but we have adapted to the harsh conditions of the outback and our soldiers can easily adapt to any foreign soil."

 AUS_eureka_rebellion_desc:0 "We were sent over to Australia by our former overlord as prisoners, unwanted minorities, and political insurgents from the homeland to work the gold mines in this alien land. Our overlord was foolish enough to believe that sending men who had reason to hate the state would not instigate a rebellion, but the gold miners did inevitably raise their flag in rebellion against the crown. Our overlord demanded that we surrender most of the riches accumulated from mining our gold, but we were having none of that nonsense! It was this rebellion that birthed the Eureka Flag, and although this rebellion failed, we now finally stand as an independent nation, and nobody will take Australian gold but Australians!"
 AUS_sandpaper_and_cheating:0 "The Diggers"
 AUS_sandpaper_and_cheating_desc:0 "The Australian Diggers are riflemen and marines deployed to fight on foreign soil for our glorious Empire. The term "digger" is slang for miner due to the fact that most Digger soldiers are miners when not on active duty. The informal term is symbolic of the Australian concept of “being mates”; equals, comrades, and friends."

 AUS_bushrangers_desc:0 "A sizeable number of settlers sent from the mainland to live in Australia were convicts and undesirables forced into exile, and the particularly cunning amongst these thieves and cutthroats would become Bushrangers. These were hardened men who used the unforgiving Australian bush as a base for their robbing operations. They were particularly rich and powerful during the Australian Gold Rush, but now that we have won our freedom for our colonial oppressors, these men are convicts to no-one, and we would do well to utilise their ambushing tactics on our enemies!"

 swabian_habsburg_league_desc:0 "Inspired by the Swiss leagues to our south, the Emperor organized the many Swabian city-states into a free and independent league with a Habsburg Prince as its leader. Unlike the Swiss Cantons which organize their government around mutual protection and a shared desire for independence and freedom, the Swabian League is a much more aggressive and militaristic union designed to contest the Swiss.

When John I abdicated his duties as Duke, he determined he would divide his titles and government amongst his sons and brothers. This deconstruction of the old Saxon state makes it somewhat unclear who is the rightful owner of what, but the confusion certainly does make claiming the region a much easier task."
 LAU_diarchy:0 "Diarchic Duchy"
 LAU_diarchy_desc:0 "Once the Duchy of Saxony had been dissolved and our nation fully established, we spent an extensive few years under a diarchic government of Eric I and a few of his brothers. Dissolving this government and centralizing Saxe-Lauenburg into a free duchy in its own right was a great challenge, but the political maneuverings taken by Eric I have made our dukes masters of statecraft and pleasing the court."

 LAU_niedersachsen_desc:0 "We find ourselves in constant conflict with the Saxon successor states, many of which hold more lands and titles than our Duke. The other nations in the area see us as pretenders to the Saxon throne, and while it may be a nice idea to sit the throne of Saxony, we need a new title for our nation that at least gives the illusion that we have no desire to unite the Saxon nations. Niedersachsen, meaning Lower Saxony, both confirms that we do not claim to be the successors to the old Saxon duchy while not weakening our claim to the title, should we choose to pursue it."

Currently, the Saxon states are divided into the Upper-Saxon Circle and the Lower-Saxon Circle, and it is the Upper Saxons that have the Emperor's favor and hold the electoral position. Perhaps by making the Emperor more amiable to our cause, we may make the Lower-Saxon Circle the Emperor's choice for any future electoral positions."

We adopted this title to distance ourselves from the newly converted Catholic Kingdom of Bosnia, and to venerate the great Saint Sava who had been a unifying icon for many of the different peoples of the Balkans. Saint Sava was a count of Hum who abandoned his royal titles to become a monk on Mount Athos, which he would then transform into an important religious center for the Orthodox church with the establishment of the Monastary of Hilandar.
