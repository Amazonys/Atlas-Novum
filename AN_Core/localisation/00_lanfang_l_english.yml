Pitakahara’s loyalty to the future Queen was great, and they devised a plan to escape back to Pegu together. Pitakahara is now the Queen’s closest advisor. As Shin Sawbu grows older she wishes to retire and live a life of spiritual devotion. She openly contemplates marrying Pitakahara to one of her daughters, granting him the title of Dhammazedi, and proclaiming him King of Pegu."
