 privateers.1.t:0 "Local Traders Demand Aid"
 privateers.1.d:0 "Merchants and captains of trade vessels in [Root.GetName] have sent a representative to the government, describing their home as increasingly lawless land, where piracy runs rampant and ships and ports are routinely raided by privateers. They argue that the government has neglected them and request funding to build defenses against the growing threats. If this request is not granted, many feel like they have already lost too much and will take their business elsewhere."
 privateers.1.a:0 "Send them whatever they need."
 privateers.1.b:0 "They have enough money to fund those defenses themselves."
 privateers.2.t:0 "Invalid Letter of Marque?"
 privateers.2.d:1 "Privateering is always a difficult diplomatic issue, especially when no open war is conducted, and the distinction between an enemy who must be subject to certain rules of war and a lawless pirate is not always clear-cut. Even less so in the case of a recently captured vessel, which has displayed a letter of marque issued by a colonial governor with dubious authority.\n\nWhile this supposed privateer looks like a simple pirate to us, accepting the letter as valid may allow us to maintain better diplomacy with his masters."
 privateers.2.a:0 "This flimsy excuse can't be allowed to spare him from the gallows!"
 privateers.2.b:0 "We can afford to show some lenience in this rare case."
 privateers.3.t:0 "Invalid Letter of Marque?"
 privateers.3.d:0 "Pirates are a constant scourge of our merchants, and successfully detaining them is usually a great victory not only for us, but for our trade partners as well. Our most recent capture of a supposed pirate, on the other hand, has turned into a diplomatic incident, as he claims to have been raiding ships on behalf of one of our own colonial subjects.\n\nThe captain has presented a letter of marque issued in the name of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but by a colonial governor. Supposedly, any aggression against us was a tragic misunderstanding. Desperately trying to avoid the gallows, the captain implores us to settle the matter with the governor."
 privateers.3.a:0 "The governor overstepped his authority. This pirate will hang."
 privateers.3.b:0 "A letter issued in our name is valid, even from a subject."
 privateers.4.t:0 "A Reckless Privateer"
 privateers.4.d:0 "Enlisting the aid of privateers to wreck the trade efforts of our adversaries has proven beneficial to us, but also tends to attract unreliable and devious business partners. One captain has become notorious for skirting the rules and ignoring treaties our privateers are supposed to abide by, but also happens to be very efficient in raiding enemy ships.\n\nPerhaps these two traits are connected, perhaps not. Regardless, revoking the captain's letter of marque would be the diplomatically safe option, but would lose us our best privateer."
 privateers.4.a:0 "Laws and treaties are more like guidelines, anyway..."
 privateers.4.b:0 "We will not tolerate outlaws in our employ!"
 privateers.5.t:0 "Privateer Captain Goes Rogue"
 privateers.5.d:0 "There is a very fine line between privateering and piracy, especially in peacetime. The captain and crew of one of our privateering operations recently waltzed across that line when they decided to attack and plunder one of our own traders. Worse yet, we have been informed that this act of open defiance was only the beginning of their exploits, and that these traitors have now set out to make their own fortune... primarily, it seems, out of our fortune."
 privateers.5.a:0 "We'll have their heads for this!"
 privateers.6.t:0 "Oceans Beyond Privateering"
 privateers.6.d:0 "One of our most accomplished privateers is making forays not only into enemy waters, but into parts of the world we were barely aware were under their control. His skills as a navigator could be put to better use if we provided the funds for a longer expedition to discover just how far the hand of the enemy reaches, perhaps even reaching further, claiming new lands for [Root.GetName] in the name of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 privateers.6.a:0 "Let him lead the way. Our ships shall encircle the world."
 privateers.6.b:0 "Privateers should look for money from our enemies, not from us."
 privateers.7.t:0 "Pirates Seeking Allegiance"
 privateers.7.d:0 "Our use of privateering to strengthen our position on the oceans has not gone unnoticed by the unsavory individuals who raid ships without the blessing of a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While we prefer not to see many similarities between our legitimate authorizations of reprisal and these pests, some of them see quite a few.\n\nSome of the more successful pirates in our area of interest are seeking to receive the backing of [Root.GetName] is more or less official capacity. They are also suggesting, through crude insinuations, that if we don't take them up on the offer, someone else just might."
 privateers.7.a:0 "We could use some ruthless seafarers in our employ."
 privateers.7.b:0 "This is extortion. We won't do business with pirates."
 privateers.7.b.tt:0 "The pirates will take their 'business' to the [This.Monarch.GetTitle] of [This.GetName] instead."
 privateers.8.t:0 "Pirates Seeking Allegiance"
 privateers.8.d:0 "A group of pirates recently approached one of our privateers, requesting [Root.GetAdjective] support in their efforts to plunder and pillage. Of course, once they have our backing, our own ships would be safe from them. Apparently, they are especially interested in raiding the trade routes of [From.GetName], since they seem to have presented the same offer to the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and been rejected and insulted in response."
 privateers.8.a:0 "We have no such reservations. They can count themselves among our privateers."
 privateers.8.b:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] was right to reject this scourge of honest traders."
 privateers.9.t:0 "Captured Slavers"
 privateers.9.d:0 "One of our privateers has captured a ship containing what its owners considered cargo, but what we consider people: Slaves. [Root.GetName] has outlawed the abhorrent practice of slavery, but other nations are not so enlightened.\n\nThe slaves have gained their freedom, but there is still some discussion about what to do with those who transported them. Showing lenience and treating them as traders, although operating under a different flag and legislation, would be the diplomatic option. However, our laws and moral sensibilities suggest that slavers should always be viewed as pirates and kidnappers and dealt with accordingly."
 privateers.9.a:0 "Those who trade in human lives are pirates and nothing more."
 privateers.9.b:0 "We'll let them go for now."
 privateers.10.t:0 "Feuding Families"
 privateers.10.d:0 "An influential politician and patriarch of a merchant family in our republic has approached us with a problem. Apparently, a family that once belonged to our republic has shifted its allegiances towards another republic. Seething with anger, the merchant insists that this is all to spite him and his kin, rambling about a feud between the two families that has gone on for generations, supposedly dating back to a slight at some ball in long-forgotten times.\n\nNow, he looks to us for support in pursuing this conflict violently. In exchange for a letter of reprisal against the foreign republic, he promises to personally pay for improved armaments on our privateering vessels."
 privateers.10.a:0 "Better take the opportunity. How long could this feud last?"
 privateers.10.b:0 "Isn't it time to put these petty dynastic rivalries behind us?"
 privateers.11.t:0 "Plausible Deniability"
 privateers.11.d:0 "Conducting any form of attacks on rival ships in peacetime, whether through sanctioning reprisals or private wars or covertly backing piracy, has had many benefits to us, but is not without problems. One of our privateering operations was recently compromised and the ships and crew captured. As luck would have it, they had lost their letter of marque, proving they work with our approval, and whatever proof connects them to us is purely circumstantial.\n\nAs a last resort, the captain has now contacted us, hoping we will admit to our official backing so it can be used as leverage in the upcoming trial."
 privateers.11.a:0 "These are legitimate merchants retaliating against foreign aggressions!"
 privateers.11.b:0 "We've never seen these marauders before. They look like rogue pirates to me."
 privateers.12.t:0 "Merchants call for Trade Protection War"
 privateers.12.d:0 "Trade is the backbone of our nation's economy, which we must take care to safeguard against threats. Recent developments have led to outrage among merchants who think we are not doing enough to defend against privateering ships from foreign nations, which are severely harming our trade efforts.\n\nMany trading vessels are beginning to arm themselves, arguing that the presence of these privateers prove that we are already fighting an undeclared trade war. They offer to aid in improving the nation's navy, but demand in return that we go from clandestine hostilities to open warfare to oust the privateers within five years from now."
 privateers.12.a:0 "Bring the materials for our fleet, and we will crush our enemies!"
 privateers.12.a.tt:0 "Promise to declare a war with the Trade Protection casus belli to thwart privateering within five years."
 privateers.12.b:0 "There is no reason to escalate the conflict."
 privateers.13.t:0 "Merchants remind us of Commitments to War"
 privateers.13.d:0 "It has been three years since we promised traders suffering the effects of foreign privateering to declare war upon those who support such dishonest practices. Now, they are reminding us of our commitment. Having offered support to prepare our fleet for the past three years, they demand we make good on our promise and attack."
 privateers.13.a:0 "The attack will commence as planned."
 privateers.13.b:0 "It sounded reasonable at the time, but it's too risky now..."
 privateers.13.c:0 "Privateering has decreased. We no longer have a reason to go to war."
 privateers.14.t:0 "Merchants Outraged about Broken Promise"
 privateers.14.d:0 "Five years ago, we promised to declare open war on the treacherous nations who were already fighting a private war by supporting privateers plaguing our trade routes. However, despite having provided resources for shipbuilding towards the war effort, our merchants now find us having failed to make good on the agreement. They are furious and demanding radical changes in policy, undermining our authority."
 privateers.14.a:0 "Greedy warmongers..."
 privateers.15.t:0 "Undeclared Trade War Now Declared"
 privateers.15.d:0 "As promised to our merchants, we are now at war with the nations who thought they could carry on hostilities under the guise of private conflicts. The merchants are satisfied with our honesty and will continue supporting the navy as agreed upon."
 privateers.15.a:0 "Let us see how the enemy handles an open war."
 privateers.16.t:0 "Pirate War"
 privateers.16.d:0 "The mutual financing of privateers and borderline piracy against our rivals and their use of the same tactics against us have gotten out of hand. While we both refuse to declare open war over the conflicts, a de facto war is already being fought by both sides on the oceans of the world. This escalation is now mainly benefitting those who operate as privateers, hurting both their trade and ours."
 privateers.16.a:0 "We can only make sure that it hurts them more."
