 setup.10.t: "Mechanics"
 setup.10.d: "Atlas Novum brings a number of new mechanics."
 setup.10.a: "Development"
 setup.10.b: "Diseases"
 setup.10.c: "Buildings"
 setup.10.d1: "Colonial Region Sales"
 setup.10.e: "Age-Locked Colonization"

 setup.101.t: "Development"
 setup.101.d: "Development has been reworked into Wealth, Infrastructure and Population. Wealth and Infrastructure may be upgraded manually; Wealth and Population grow and decline passively.\n\nEvery province has a Wealth Progress and Population Progress that ranges between 0 and 100. When Progress reaches 100, that type grows by 1; when it reaches 0, it declines. Wealth growth is determined by provincial Trade Value and Infrastructure divided by local logistics cost. Population growth is determined by Terrain and Infrastructure, subtracted by consumption (population multiplied by local logistics cost).\n\nThe chance that a famine occurs or escalates in a province is checked every year. Negative population progress and exceeding local carrying capacity puts a province at risk of famine. Should a famine occur, it will always initiate as a mild famine, with a nasty but survivable modifier and small reduction in development. However, should famine proc again thereafter, that mild famine will then escalate, adding an even worse modifier, and reducing development even more."
 setup.102.t: "Diseases"
 setup.102.d: "Being packed in close spaces with livestock and bustling trade, especially when war or famine causes the social order to buckle, allows disease to fester. Ingame, 13 major diseases will crop up, in three broad categories. Some, like Typhus, linger in urban areas and dense population bases, occasionally flaring into localized but devastating outbreaks. Others, such as Cholera, may also achieve epidemic status, spreading far and wide from regions impacted by famine and war, with a 50% chance of spreading to each adjacent province as they go. Setpiece events from the meeting of worlds, the final form of infectious diseases are a one-time trigger to scythe across native populations of the Americas and Oceania, never to return again."
 setup.103.t: "Buildings"
 setup.103.d: "Buildings have been greatly altered. Urban infrastructure can be constructed when a certain population and economic threshold is met, and certain buildings can only be built in cities. Infrastructure buildings increase the amount of Infrastructure a province can have, crucial to develop a production and trade base as well as grow wealth and population. Enough infrastructure buildings may also allow you to replace the trade goods in a targeted province. Additionally, some buildings - specifically naval and administrative buildings - can only be supported by a city, and conversely many buildings (often military or faith-based) can only exist in the hinterland. Finally, there are country-unique buildings that provide large, flat bonuses for relatively focused empires."
 setup.104.t: "Colonial Region Sales"
 setup.104.d: "Colonial Regions may be bought through the diplomatic interface, but the diplomatic action may only be taken Human players."
 setup.105.t: "Age-Locked Colonization"
 setup.105.d: "Some provinces are no longer able to be colonized from the Age of Discovery. Now, to better represent the historical expansion taken by the European powers due to a variety of factors such as disease and climate, certain provinces will only become available for colonization after reaching the Age of Reformation, Absolutism, or Revolutions."


 setup.11.t: "Vassals"
 setup.11.d: "Atlas Novum brings three new types of vassals: Fiefdoms, Domains, and Confederates; while also revising several mechanics for Tributaries, Vassals, and Marches."
 setup.11.a: "Fiefdoms"
 setup.11.b: "Domains"
 setup.11.c: "Confederates"
 setup.11.d1: "Tributaries, Vassals, and Marches"

 setup.111.t: "Fiefdoms"
 setup.111.d: "Fiefdoms are small feudal subjects that are of the same culture-group and same religious-group as your nation. You must have embraced Feudalism, not follow a Pagan religion, and be of the Western, Eastern, Anatolian, Muslim, Indian, Chinese, Indochinese, Malay or High American tech groups. There are two main exceptions. The Holy Roman Empire will function like one big culture-group so long as both parties are members, excluding Electors, Free Cities, and the Emperor. Muslim nations will be able to make fiefs of any other neighboring Muslim nation, or one of the same culture-group (but different religion)."
 setup.112.t: "Domains"
 setup.112.d: "Domains are special vassals intended to represent the various realms, domains, developed colonial holdings, commonwealths, and cokingdoms. In other words, Domains can be thought of as the ultimate vassals of your empire. Oftentimes received as a reward for completing a set of missions, Domains take over the day-to-day management of the area while also providing excellent economic benefits and will remain exceptionally loyal in all but the most extreme cases. "
 setup.113.t: "Confederates"
 setup.113.d: "Confederates are highly loyal coentities that formally share power with your nation. For the purposes of gameplay mechanics, confederates are a vassal type that greatly boosts the power of the confederates, at the cost of benefits afforded to more typically-centralized entities. Indeed, Confederates are almost always very small entities that have been united for collective independence. The conditions surrounding their formation is limited to specific events and CBs, like for the Swiss or Aragonese."
 setup.114.t: "Tributaries, Vassals, and Marches"
 setup.114.d: "Nations that are Merchant Kingdoms or Mandalas or are Tapu, may enforce tributary status on neighboring and nearby nations. Vassals have had several rare conditions for their annexation added, and will be represented in the Annex tooltip if engaged. Marches can now grow up to 33% of your total development, and have greater military bonuses. However, they may also be transferred en masse by a rival power. Marches may also be forced on small powers that border two rivalled great powers. Thus, Marches' value is much higher, but also more susceptible to being pried away."

 setup.12.t: "Formables"
 setup.12.d: "Formable nations are divided into two distinct types: Mid-Game and Late-Game."
 setup.12.a: "Mid-Game Formable Nations"
 setup.12.b: "Late-Game Formable Nations"

 setup.121.t: "Mid-Game Formable Nations"
 setup.121.d: "Typically available in the Age of Reformation, mid-game formable decisions not only change one's tag, but also integrate all of their subject fiefdoms."
 setup.122.t: "Late-Game Formable Nations"
 setup.122.d: "Available in the Age of Revolutions, late-game formable decisions not only change one's tag a second time, but also integrate all of their subject domains."

 setup.13.t: "Missions"
 setup.13.d: "Missions are generally divided into several different classes. These classes are differentiated by object, and same-class missions tend to be similar in reward."
 setup.13.a: "Conquest"
 setup.13.b: "Control"
 setup.13.c: "Discovery"
 setup.13.d1: "Colonize"
 setup.13.e: "Internal"
 setup.13.f: "Capstone"

 setup.131.t: "Conquest"
 setup.131.d: "Conquest missions are a standard mission type that requires the nation to take ownership of specific provinces, areas, or regions. This is usually done by direct conquest or subjugation of the nation that owns the necessary province."
 setup.132.t: "Control"
 setup.132.d: "Control missions are a special mission type that requires the nation to either take control during a war or direct ownership of specific provinces. If taken, the lands controlled will be seized. Control missions revert into conquest missions when the target provinces are owned by a player."
 setup.133.t: "Discovery"
 setup.133.d: "Discovery missions are a standard mission type that requires the nation to discover certain provinces on the world map. These missions usually reward outposts and claims to aid expansion into the area in question."
 setup.134.t: "Colonize"
 setup.134.d: "Colonization missions are a standard mission type that requires the nation to colonize a certain number of provinces in a colonial region. These missions usually reward claims and cores on the rest of the colonial region."
 setup.135.t: "Internal"
 setup.135.d: "Internal missions are a special mission type that varies from situation to situation. Sometimes they require finishing disasters, developing specific provinces or areas, constructing buildings or units, or otherwise achieving a domestic goal."
 setup.136.t: "Capstone"
 setup.136.d: "Capstone missions are a special mission type that typically comes at the end of a sub-tree. These missions reward powerful bonuses to those capable of achieving them."

 setup.14.t: "Decisions and Events"
 setup.14.d: "Atlas Novum: Europa brings a large number of unique decisions and events."
 setup.14.a: "Government Reforms"
 setup.14.b: "Trade Goods"

 setup.141.t: "Government Reforms"
 setup.141.d: "New government reforms have been added in. In general, the major nations have unique government types that often enable unique mechanics, decisions, or estates. \n\nIberian nations now have the Iberian Reino, Iberian Crown, and Iberian Monarch unique reforms. \n\nFrench nations now have the French Principality, French Crown, and French Monarchy unique reforms."
 setup.142.t: "Trade Goods"
 setup.142.d: "Many aspects of trade goods have been tweaked, including their spawn rates in uncolonized provinces, special decisions relating to valuable resources such as salt and silver, as well as rebalanced province and trading-in modifiers."

This increased spending power in the populace has propelled the merchant-artisan class ever higher. Loans and investments from merchant banks have become central to the financial planning of leaders everywhere.\nRegained trust in bullion allows for stable, universally accepted coinage with which to conduct increasingly complex transactions. Banks and brokerages provide the security needed to undertake risky long-distance and high cost-of-entry overseas trade. Modern finance will eventually make the most powerful engines of European dominance - the central bank, the stock exchange and the company sovereign.

Magnates of businesses have begun to replace merchants as the dominant factor in the capitalist system and are a new power responsible for the decline of artisanry and guilds. These wealthy individuals are able to facilitate access to raw materials and organize masses of labor previously unattainable.

Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference; that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity. It aims to build and maintain a cohesive national identity, based on shared social characteristics of culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics, religion, traditions, and shared history. Combined with the dawn of liberalism on the world stage, this movement has inspired radicals to call for a multitude of changes to the world order. From unification of divided peoples, autonomy and liberation for those that view themselves as a people distinct, and renewed battles for freedom of New World colonies.

Industrialization allows cheap production of items using economies of scale to simulaneously keep costs down  and maintain a consumer class. Rapid population growth has created sustained demand for commodities. More people are pouring into the cities as cottage and manufacturing shifts to factory work. The last gasps of the landed gentry have been drowned out by the triumphant clamor of middle-class business. With mass production and urbanization comes vast social changes, increasing consumer choice dramatically. Where once laborers ate from metal platters with wooden implements, ordinary workers now dine on porcelain with metal implements. Consumers have come to demand an array of household goods and furnishings - metal knives and forks, for example, as well as rugs, carpets, mirrors, cooking ranges, pots, pans, watches, clocks, and a dizzying array of furniture.

However Donskoy willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then the successor would be Vasily's brother, Yury Dmitrievich of Zvenigorod. Although Yury posed no direct threat to Vasily I during his reign, problems arose at the beginning of Vasily II's rule. In 1433 Yury staged an invasion, entering Moscow and declaring himself Grand Prince. But upon his sudden death, Vasily II regained control of Moscow and allied himself with Dmitry Shemyaka, a son of Yury Dmitrievich. Coupled with this was the threat of the newly-formed Khanate of Kazan, the future of Muscovy is in question..."

Given the suspicious nature and timing of the deaths, many accusations of poisoning have been levied on the King's favorite advisor Álvaro de Luna. \n\nHowever, with little evidence besides rumors of jealous courtiers [Root.Monarch.GetName] has dismissed such outlandish accusations. Thus, de Luna's manipulation of [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues with his suggestion of remarriage to a young Portuguese noble..."
 IR_flavor_SPA.1.a: "Wed Isabella de Avis from Portugal!"

 IR_flavor_SPA.2.t: "A Stunning Betrayal"
 IR_flavor_SPA.2.d: "Álvaro de Luna has long been a trusted advisor of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. When Queen Maria had died under suspicious circumstances, the King waved away accusations of poison and continued to follow the suggestions of de Luna, remarrying Isabella de Avis. \n\nIsabella has begun to exert more and more influence over the decisions of [Root.Monarch.GetName], in doing so supplanting the political influence of de Luna. Thus, when Isabella began to make her fear of being by poisoned by de Luna known, de Luna became further suspected. \n\nThe king's accountant Alonso Pérez de Vivero has been deliberately insulting de Luna on behalf of Isabella, who has chosen to ignore him. On Good Friday de Luna and Pérez were in the castle of Burgos, de Luna found letters arranging his murder at the next meeting of the council. He demanded Pérez say who the writer of the first letter was, to be told it was the king, yet the second letter was in the handwriting of Pérez. De Luna then threw Pérez out of a window and an abutment of the tower broke open his skull, surely action must be taken against such an act!?"

 IR_flavor_SPA.3.t: "An End to Álvaro de Luna"

 IR_flavor_SPA.3.a: "Off with his head!"

 IR_flavor_SPA.4.t: "Farce of Ávila"
 IR_flavor_SPA.4.d: "Unhappy with the way that he and Beltrán de la Cueva were treated by [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Marqués of Villena sent the King an ultimatum. Failing to come to an agreement, the like-minded Castilians that make up the League of Nobles decided to hold a ceremonial stripping of the King's authority. \n\nIn the public square of Ávila, the nobles constructed a wooden effigy representing [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The statue was dressed in mourning clothes, along with the King's crown, staff, and sword. Following a public mass, the Marqués of Villena read a declaration of charges against the King, including being sympathetic to the Muslim plight, being a homosexual, and of not being the father of Princess Joanna - making her ineligible for the throne. \n\nFollowing the speech, the archbishop of Toledo removed the crown, the count of Plasencia to the sword, the count of Benavente took the staff, and finally the brother of the count of Plasencia tore down the statue exclaiming: 'To the ground, Bitch!' \n\nThe conspirators then brought eleven-year-old prince Alfonso XII to the platform, and named him King, to be used as a pupped by the League of Nobles."

 IR_flavor_SPA.5.t: "A Royal Ascension"
 IR_flavor_SPA.5.d: "Though Enrique recently divorced his first wife, the death of his father and subsequent coronation as King has necessitated a remarriage. Portugal, a long time ally, has offered Joana de Avis' hand in marriage, which the Cortes has hastily endorsed. Thus Enrique IV and Joana ascend to the Castilian throne as rulers of a Crown facing significant conflict with the nobility."

 IR_flavor_SPA.6.d: "After the elimination of de Luna from the court of Castile, new figures of importance have begun to emerge. Moreover, with the passing of the crown to [Root.Monarch.GetName], the skills of Juan Pachecho and Pedro Gíron have not gone unnoticed. \n\nWith relatively little ability to adequately govern the whole crown, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has increasingly relied upon the advisory of Juan Pachecho and Pedro Gíron, and has considered putting them in a more suitable position for their administrative abilities."

 IR_flavor_SPA.9.d: "Though the various nobles involved in the administration of the crown are relatively talented, the Marqués de Villena, Juan Panchecho, has begun to grow resentful of the gifts showered on Beltrán de la Cueva by King Enrique IV. Indeed, he has begun to initiate increasingly dramatic actions, such as seizing the assets of the now-deceased de Luna in an attempt to supplant the growing influence of Beltrán. \n\nThese actions have alienated the broader nobility, who have decided to form the League of Nobles to oppose our administration."

To the West, Portugal's growth is fueled by is exploration to the far south, into the riches of Africa. To the North, France continues it's path of centralization, and remains one of the richest Kingdoms in the world. To whom shall we send an offer of marriage to?"

 IR_flavor_SPA.21.d: "Joanna, born in 1462, was the only child born to King Henry IV of Castile and was called Princess of Asturias as heir presumptive to the throne. A rumor spread that she was not actually the daughter of King Henry but rather of Beltrán de la Cueva, the alleged lover of Henry's wife, Joan of Portugal. Joanna was thus nicknamed "la Beltraneja", as a mocking reference to her assumed father. Pressure from members of the nobility forced the King to strip her of the title and name his half-brother Alfonso as heir presumptive in 1464. In 1465, a group of nobility assembled in Ávila and overthrew King Henry, replacing him with Alfonso. Henry IV regained the throne, but the title of heir became disputed between Joanna, his daughter, and Isabella, his half-sister. That was resolved via the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando, which gave Isabella succession rights but restricted her marriage options. Isabella secretly married Ferdinand in 1469 at the age of 17, ignoring Henry IV's wishes. Gradually, the couple gained a larger number of supporters and obtained a papal bull sanctioning their marriage from Pope Sixtus IV in 1472. When Henry IV died in December 1474, both candidates for the throne were proclaimed Queen of Castile by their respective supporters.\n\nHenry IV regained the throne, but the title of heir became disputed between Joanna, his daughter, and Isabella, his half-sister.

It put an end to the War of the Castilian Succession, which ended with a victory of the Castilians on land and a Portuguese victory on the sea.

Her husband Philip I was the Habsburg son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy. Shortly thereafter Joanna began to lapse into insanity, though the extent of her mental illness was the topic of some debate. In 1506, Philip I was declared jure uxoris king, but he died later that year under mysterious circumstances, possibly poisoned by his father-in-law, Ferdinand II.

As the Spanish army approached Cusco, however, Pizarro sent his brother Juan Pizarro and Hernando de Soto ahead with forty men.

The next day, 15 November 1533, Pizarro entered Cusco, accompanied by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a young Inca prince who had survived the massacre that Quizquiz had done to the nobility in Cusco. The Spanish plundered Cusco, where they found much gold and silver. Manco was crowned as Sapa Inca and helped Pizarro to drive Quizquiz back to the North. Quizquiz was eventually killed, after being struck down by his own followers, leaving none to lead the Inca Empire, since his only equal commander, Chalkuchimac, had been burned in captivity. Three years later Manco Inca Yupanqui fled from Cusco and tried to recapture the city with some 100,000 Incas, but ultimately failed after a ten-month siege"

At its height, the rebels controlled the heart of Castile, ruling the cities of Valladolid, Tordesillas, and Toledo. The revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the Crown of Castile after the death of Queen Isabella I in 1504. Isabella's daughter Joanna succeeded to the throne. Due to Joanna's mental instability, Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, as a regent. After Ferdinand's death in 1516, Joanna's sixteen-year-old son Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in the Netherlands with little knowledge of Castilian. He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics. These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites, who could see the threat to their power and status. On April 23, 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar.

Indeed, while we have fully occupied these lands, the locals clearly intend to make us pay in blood for every hill taken and tax levied. Thus, as other frontiers beckon, many in our court seek to put the Albanian question to bed.

Toskeria has been abandoned to the Turks, what garrisons remain are weary and woefully undersupplied. In short, our ability to continue the fight is severely limited.

This man has clearly been corrupted by power, one could debate whether the Crown should truly belong to him. At the latest parliament, Joan Dusai, the noted doctor of laws, ruled that the king has violated four of the Usatges de Barcelona, four of the Constitucions de Catalunya, and the Furs de Lleida. We can not tolerate this anymore, it is time we throw our lot in with Carlos..."

We should appeal to Rene the Good of Provence and Anjou, is the grandson of King Joan the Lover. We should appeal to Rene for aid..."

Now that Joan II has died the question of his succession has risen. His wish was that Navarra would go to his daughter, Eleanor, ruler of Foix, while the Crown of Aragon would remain with his son Ferdinand. We have worked hard to maintain this unity, and others will surely try to exploit us if we allow this union to splinter."

After her death John II claimed the kingdom for himself. The problem was that part of the marriage agreement was that their eldest son, Charles IV, Prince of Viana, was to succeed after Blanche's death. John II and Charles don't get along, at all. This has come to a boiling point now that John has married Juana Enriquez de Córdoba, who tends to interfere in internal affairs. Now the various Basque Bands have started to take sides, it may be beyond reconciliation now..."

 IR_flavor_NAV.15.d:0 "Though King Alfons V has no legitimate children, the line of succession in Aragon seems secure as the King’s brother, Prince Joan, has been confirmed as next in line for the throne. Prince Joan was long married to Queen Blanche of Navarra, who sadly died in the spring of the Year of Our Lord 1441. Rather than the Navarrese kingdom passing to their son Karlos, Joan was able to secure the throne for himself and now rules as King of Navarra in his own right. The consequence of this is that the Crowns of Aragon and Navarra will be united if King Alfonso dies while Joan still lives, so long as Navarra remains an independent nation. However Joan has a... reputation, and many may resist his rule."
 IR_flavor_NAV.15.a:0 "Let us hope for a smooth succession."

 IR_flavor_NAV.17.t:0 "Succession of Eleanor"
 IR_flavor_NAV.17.d:0 "Navarre has maintained its independence, for now. Eleanor and her husband Gaston had 3 sons. The oldest son Gaston IV was made heir of his fathers estates and the kingdom of Navarre. He however died before he could inherit the kingdom, instead upon Eleanor's death the kingdom will be inherited by his eldest son Francis Phoebus, whos' mother Magdalena of Valois will act as regent until he comes of age. \nIf something would happen to him, then his younger sister Catherine would have to rule in his stead. Their uncle John of Foix. Viscount of Narbonne may oppose this, and many of the Beaumont lords feel Ferdinand of Aragon would be a better option."
 IR_flavor_NAV.17.a:0 "Navarre must push on!"

 IR_flavor_NAV.18.t:0 "Death of Eleanor"
 IR_flavor_NAV.18.d:0 "Our great queen Eleanor has passed on, but she has not left us without hope. Her grandson Francis is too young yet to reign, but under the careful watch of Magdalena de Valois, his mother, he will have time to grow into the king Navarra needs!"
 IR_flavor_NAV.18.a:0 "Long live Francis Phoebes"

 IR_flavor_NAV.19.t:0 "Tragedy of Francis Phoebus"
 IR_flavor_NAV.19.d:0 "Francis, our young king, was found dead after playing his pipe. Likely he was poisoned by those wretched Beaumonts! \n\nNavarre is surrounded by wolves, we can not simply sit by. Should we make Catherine queen with Magdalena remaining as regent until she comes of age? John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne and son of Eleanor, will not approve of this and will likely decide now is the perfect time to try and assert his foolish claim the crown by the Salic Law. We have no such law here. Others as well are starting to meddle in our affairs, with Ferdinand of Aragon claiming the throne for himself. \n\nWe must eliminate this threat before this situation spirals out of control."
 IR_flavor_NAV.19.a:0 "Long live Catherine, true queen of Navarra!"
 IR_flavor_NAV.19.b:0 "Enough is enough, we must give the throne to Ferdinand."

 IR_flavor_NAV.20.t:0 "The Marriage of Catherine"
 IR_flavor_NAV.20.d:0 "The time has come for us to crown Catherine as Queen of Navarre. However in this world, with our nation surrounded by vultures, it is essential that we find a suitable spouse for Catherine. The Beaumonts would have her married to John, Prince of Asturias, the son of Ferdinand and Isabella of Castille - Aragon. This would likely end up to with Navarre being consumed by the Castillian crown, but it would probably be the safest route. We have another option from Alain of Albret though, an intriguing one for sure. Alain is known for his diplomatic prowess, and Catherine could marry his son John, Count of Perigord and Viscount of Limoges. This would give us powerful allies in Gascony and direct control of Perigord and Limoges. In order to balance out this offer Ferdinand and Alain have worked out a deal, in which we release Bearn as an independent nation. Unfortunately the Beaumonts are very much opposed to this offer, and will likely caused issues. Which marriage offer should we choose, or should we pursue another option?"
 IR_flavor_NAV.20.a:0 "Marry Catherine to John of Albret."
 IR_flavor_NAV.20.b:0 "Marry Catherine to John, Prince of Asturias."
 IR_flavor_NAV.20.c:0 "Let's pursue another option somewhere else."

 IR_flavor_NAV.21.t:0 "An Iberian Succession"
 IR_flavor_NAV.21.d:0 "After the matrimonial union between John, Prince of Asturias and Catherine, Queen of Navarre it was fate for the Kingdom to come into possession of the Castilian Monarchy. With the death of Catherine, the realm is placed under regency of John, and will eventually be inherited by their progeny, heirs to both Kingdoms."
 IR_flavor_NAV.21.a:0 "May she rest in peace."

 IR_flavor_NAV.22.t:0 "The Rebellion of the Beaumonts"
 IR_flavor_NAV.22.d:0 "The Beaumonts are done playing political and diplomatic games. With their backing in Castille they have rebelled against Catherine and John in an attempt to prevent their coronation. The Beaumont Count of Lerin has seized several fortresses and must be dealt with. Ferdinand of Aragon has told us not to accept the aid offered by Bearn. If we don't do something the quickly then Castille may interfere and we will have a real situation on our hands..."
 IR_flavor_NAV.22.a:0 "Accept aid from Bearn and put down the Beaumonts, it is time we end this once and for all"
 IR_flavor_NAV.22.b:0 "Work out a deal with the Beaumonts, we will finish this later..."

 IR_flavor_NAV.23.t:0 "The End of Navarre?"
 IR_flavor_NAV.23.d:0 "We have fought for a long time to keep Navarre an independent kingdom, maybe we have been fighting in vane. After an overwhelming invasion by the combined forces of Castille and Aragon, along with support from their Beaumont allies from within, Navarre is almost completely overwhelmed. Pamplona held off the enemy forces for as long as they could, now they have been forced to yield. This may be the end. We have a choice before us though, as we have a chance to survive if we would yield our Iberian lands to Castille-Aragon and offer what remains of our kingdom as a fief to France. What should we do?"
 IR_flavor_NAV.23.a:0 "It is over, yield to Castille and France."
 IR_flavor_NAV.23.b:0 "Fight on! Fight on!"

 IR_flavor_NAV.24.t:0 "Subjugation of Navarre"
 IR_flavor_NAV.24.d:0 "We have beaten back the Navarrese, who have fled across the Pyrenees mountains and are fiercely holding on to their remaining territories there. Holding the true Iberian side of the Kingdom of Navarre is sufficient for now, and if we push to hard across the Pyrenees the Kingdom of France will very likely get involved. Should we accept the concessions of Iberian Navarre or push on?"
 IR_flavor_NAV.24.a:0 "Pamplona and Iberian Navarra is all we really wanted, the Kingdom of Navarre is ours!"
 IR_flavor_NAV.24.b:0 "The entirety of Navarre must be ours, France is no match for us!"

 IR_flavor_NAV.25.t:0 "Protection Against Foreign Incursion"
 IR_flavor_NAV.25.d:0 "Navarre is still under a lot of risk from its powerful. The Crowns of Castille and Aragon have been eyeing up our kingdom for centuries, and Ferdinand is still trying to claim Navarre for himself. The king of France has been trying to make us revoke our territories outside of Iberia, namely Foix and Bigorre. Bearn is also threatened by the French Crown, perhaps we can make a deal with them."
 IR_flavor_NAV.25.a:0 "Leave it be, we don't want to upset the French or any other major power"
 IR_flavor_NAV.25.b:0 "Form a Confederation with Bearn, let us join our Gascon brethren in a permanent defensive alliance." #(Navarre gains Bearn as a Confederate vassal)

 IR_flavor_NAP.10.d: "Giannantonio Orsini was many things throughout his life: shrewd, influential, and most powerful baronial lord of Naples. Having been rewarded with the Principality of Taranto and titled Grand Constable and Duke of Bari, Giannantonio towered over other regional lords. \n\n With his sudden death, the future of Taranto is at a crossroads.

That being said, perhaps it would serve our geopolitical interests to instead crown a different ruler, such as the ruler of Cephalonia.

 revenge_for_varna.1.d1: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Hungary has been left in a state of political uncertainty. Under the leadership of regent-elect János Hunyadi, Hungary has quickly reformed its armies and begun to fully concentrate on the existential threat brewing to the south. If Hungary is to maintain its long-term strategic future, the Ottomans must be pushed back, and Varna must be avenged!"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d2: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Serbia has become nominal vassal to the Ottomans under the conditions of the Peace of Szeged. Though Serbia's position was indefensible at the time - necessitating such a humiliating peace deal - however János Hunyadi has offered us a chance to redeem our kingdom and strike the Ottoman menace on our doorstep! On the other hand, the Ottomans would likely repay us for maintaining our loyalty several times over!"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d3: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Wallachia has been at the mercy of the overwhelming Turkish armies. With the loss of riverine fortress such as Giurgiu, Wallachia's only natural defense against the encroaching Ottomans - the Danube - has been nullified. However, János Hunyadi has offered to include us in his attempt to press back the Turks, should we formally hand over feudal territories in Oltenia. Maintaining our neutrality in the conflict could mean keeping those territories and attaining crucial Turkish goodwill..."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d4: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Albania has borne the brunt of the Ottoman advance. Though many Ottoman armies were tied up in Anatolia dealing with the Karamanids, it was still only through Skanderbeg's brilliant leadership that ensured Albania's survival. Now, after repeated requests for Christian help, János Hunyadi has finally come to join the fray. Though, the peace we have achieved with the Ottomans was costly and hard fought for. Though it is appreciated that Hunyadi now seeks our aid, perhaps a chance to rebuild is more valuable than yet another devastating war with the Turks..."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d5: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Albania has borne the brunt of the Ottoman advance. Though perhaps not directly vulnerable now, the eventual Ottoman threat looms clearly. If we are to maintain any sort of independent sovereignty, we must consider our future carefully. Supporting Albania and halting the Ottoman armies in the Illyric mountains seems the obvious choice. Still, there are some in our court that advocate betrayal of our Christian allies in lieu of a guarantee of independence from the Ottomans."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d6: "Since before the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Bulgaria has been reduced to nought but a shadow of its former self. Shattered into three, and reduced to a single puny territory, the future of Bulgaria seems one of Turkish domination. However, with the call to Balkan Christians being circulated by János Hunyadi, perhaps now is the time to finally retake our lost territories! On the flipside, the power of the Ottomans is unquestionable, having seen it firsthand. Perhaps a more prudent course would be to assist the Ottomans in exchange for local concessions?"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d7: "Bitter in their devastating loss in the ill-advised campaign at Varna, the Christians have only become more agitated by our growing influence in Europe. János Hunyadi, a formidable foe and regent-elect of Hungary is attempting to align the Balkans against us in an attempt to return our advances.

 IR_marriages.1.d: "Ferdinand II, king of Aragon, was married to the princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid in October 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. The marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. Many considered Ferdinand the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them. Machiavelli attributed to him the objectionable qualities of the Renaissance prince."

His father, Louis, Grand Dauphin, had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700. However, since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip's older brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne, the Grand Dauphin's maternal uncle (Philip's granduncle) King Charles II of Spain named Philip as his heir in his will. It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe, such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it. Indeed, Philip's accession in Spain provoked the 14-year War of the Spanish Succession, which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish thrones."

He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He was assassinated in 1610 by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII.He was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre, Henry inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on the death of his mother. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army.As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was "first prince of the blood." Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law.He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France's crown as a Protestant. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a politique), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes, which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion."

A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover. At the age of 54, after the death of his second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Although over 50 Roman Catholics were closer to Anne by primogeniture, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne; George was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but their attempts failed.During George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister.

Initially of low standing, Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the Stockholm Bloodbath, in which his father perished. Gustav's election as King on 6 June 1523 and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days later marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union. As King, Gustav proved an enigmatic administrator with a ruthless streak not inferior to his predecessor's, brutally suppressing subsequent uprisings (three in Dalarna – which had once been the first region to support his claim to the throne – one in Västergötland, and one in Småland). He worked to raise taxes and bring about a Swedish Reformation, replacing the prerogatives of local landowners, noblemen and clergy with centrally appointed governors and bishops. His 37-year rule, which was the longest of a mature Swedish king to that date (subsequently passed by Gustav V and Carl XVI Gustav) saw a complete break with not only the Danish supremacy but also the Roman Catholic Church, whose assets were nationalized, with the Lutheran Church of Sweden established under his personal control."

Aside from a few attempts, supported by pro-absolutist factions among the nobility, to reclaim the absolute monarchy held by previous monarchs, he remained a mere constitutional figurehead until his death, by popular belief attributed to a heavy consumption of semlas. His reign saw an extended period of internal peace, although the finances stagnated following failed mercantilist doctrines pursued by the Hat administration. The Hat administration ended only in the 1765–66 parliament, where the Cap opposition overtook the government and enacted reforms towards greater economic liberalism as well as a Freedom of Press Act almost unique at the time for its curtailing of all censorship, retaining punitive measures only for libeling the monarch or the Lutheran state church.Following his death, his son Gustav III seized power in 1772 in a military coup d'état, reinstating absolute rule"

 ir_dynastic_events.13.d: "William I, Prince of Orange, also known as William the Silent or William the Taciturn, or more commonly known as William of Orange, was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs that set off the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1581. He was born in the House of Nassau as Count of Nassau-Dillenburg. He became Prince of Orange in 1544 and is thereby the founder of the branch House of Orange-Nassau and the ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands. Within the Netherlands he is also known as Father of the Fatherland (Dutch: Vader des Vaderlands).A wealthy nobleman, William originally served the Habsburgs as a member of the court of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Unhappy with the centralization of political power away from the local estates and with the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an outlaw by the Spanish king in 1580, he was assassinated by Balthasar Gérard (also written as "Gerardts") in Delft in 1584."

 ir_men_ned.1.t: "Michiel de Ruyter"
 ir_men_ned.1.d: "Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter, Was a Dutch admiral. He was one of the most skilled admirals in history, most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. He fought the English and French and scored several major victories against them, the best known probably being the Raid on the Medway. The pious De Ruyter was very much loved by his sailors and soldiers; from them his most significant nickname derived: Bestevaêr (older Dutch for 'grandfather'.)"
 ir_men_ned.2.t: "Cornelis de Witt"
 ir_men_ned.2.d: "Cornelis de Witt was a member of the old Dutch patrician family De Witt. He was born on 15 June 1623 in Dordrecht, Holland, Dutch Republic. He was the son of Jacob de Witt and the older brother of Johan.In 1650 he became burgomaster (mayor) of Dordrecht and member of the States of Holland and West Friesland. He was afterwards appointed to the important post of ruwaard (official), who combined the functions of chief of police and prosecuting attorney, of Putten and bailiff of Beierland .He associated himself closely with his younger brother, the Raadpensionaris of Holland ("Grand Pensionary") Johan de Witt, and supported him throughout his career with great ability and vigor. In 1667 he was the deputy chosen by the States of Holland to accompany Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in his famous raid on the Medway. Cornelis de Witt on this occasion distinguished himself greatly by his coolness and intrepidity. He again accompanied De Ruyter in 1672 and took an honorable part in the great battle of Solebay against the united English and French fleets. Compelled by illness to leave the fleet, he found on his return to Dortrecht that the Orange party were in the ascendant, and he and his brother were the objects of popular suspicion and hatred. He was arrested on false accusations of treason, but did not confess despite heavy torture and was ultimately unlawfully condemned to be banished.He was assassinated by the same carefully organized lynch mob that killed his brother on the day he was to be released, victim of a conspiracy by the Orangists Johan Kievit and Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp. Both their bodies were horribly mutilated and their hearts were carved out to be exhibited as trophies."
 ir_men_ned.3.t: "Jacobus Arminius"
 ir_men_ned.3.d: "Jacobus Arminius, the Latinized name of Jakob Hermanszoon,[a] was a Dutch theologian from the Protestant Reformation period whose views became the basis of Arminianism and the Dutch Remonstrant movement. He served from 1603 as professor in theology at the University of Leiden and wrote many books and treatises on theology.Following his death, his challenge to the Reformed standard, the Belgic Confession, provoked ample discussion at the Synod of Dort, which crafted the five points of Calvinism in response to Arminius's teaching. "
 ir_men_ned.4.t: "Jan Pieterszoon Coen "
 ir_men_ned.4.d: "Jan Pieterszoon Coen was an officer of the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia (VOC) in the early seventeenth century, holding two terms as its Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He was the founder of Batavia, the capital city of the Dutch East Indies. Renowned for providing the impulse that set the VOC on the path to dominance in the Dutch East Indies, he was long considered a national hero in the Netherlands. A famed quote of his from 1618, "Despair not, spare your enemies not, for God is with us", illustrates his single-minded ruthlessness, as well as his unstinting belief in the divinely-sanctioned nature of his project. The utilization of such self-professed divine sanction in the use of violence pursuant to his ultimate goals of Monopoly Trade was deemed by many to be excessive, even for such a relatively violent age. Consequently, since the independence of Indonesia he has been looked at in a more critical light, and historians view his often violent means to have been excessive. Coen was known in his time on account of strict governance and harsh criticism of people who did not share his views, at times directed even at the 17 Lords of the VOC (for which he was reprimanded). Coen was known to be strict towards subordinates and merciless to his opponents. His willingness to use violence to obtain his ends was too much for many, even for such a relatively violent period of history. When Saartje Specx, a girl whom he had been entrusted to care for, was found in Coen's private quarters in the arms of a soldier, Pieter Cortenhoeff, Coen showed no mercy in having Cortenhoeff beheaded. Specx only escaped the death penalty by drowning because she was still underage. "
 ir_men_ned.5.t: "Pieter de la Court"
 ir_men_ned.5.d: "Pieter de la Court was born in Leiden, the son of Pieter de la Court the Elder and Jeanne des Planques. His parents were protestant immigrants from Flanders, who settled in Leiden around 1613 in order to be able to practise their faith and to profit from the rapid expansion of Leiden as the world center of cloth manufacturing. Pieter de la Court the Elder was a successful cloth merchant before he arrived in Leiden. His wife also came from a family of wealthy cloth manufacturers. They had established themselves as members of the local economic elite by the time Pieter was born. The couple had three other children; Jacob (born 1617), Johanna (born 1620) and Johan (1622–1660). Johan is generally seen as the author of at least two of the books that have later been ascribed to Pieter.De la Court studied at Leiden University and completed his education with a Grand Tour through Europe in 1641 - 1643. He went to London, Saumur (France), Geneva and Basle. The diary he kept during his journey has been preserved and was published in 1928. After returning to Leiden, De la Court entered his father's profession and set up a cloth trading firm with his brother Johan. By 1650 the firm of the two brothers had evolved into one of the leading cloth operations in.In spite of his immigrant background De la Court was able to penetrate the social elite of Holland. He became a close friend of Johan Eleman, who was a member of Leiden's governing council and a relative of John de Witt, the de facto leader of the Dutch Republic between 1653 and 1672. In 1657 De la Court married Eleman's sister in law, Elisabeth Tollenaer, who died only one year later in childbirth. In 1660 death struck again, this time taking De la Court's younger brother and business partner Johan. Pieter was remarried in 1661, this time to Catharina van der Voort, the sister of two wealthy Amsterdam merchants and, again, a relative of John de WittIt was in this turbulent period of De la Court's life that he published almost all of his books about the political economy of Holland and the larger Dutch Republic. In the preface to the Interest van Holland, the most renowned of these books, he explicitly ascribed this publishing frenzy to the need to distract his mind from the tragedy that had hit him. The centerpiece of this body of work was the Interest of Holland, published in 1662. It contained a critical analysis of the economic success of the Dutch Republic and demonstrated how this success had been brought about by the combined effects of free competition and free (i.e. republican) government. It became a bestseller overnight. In Holland the Interest van Holland gained notoriety and infamy as a republican manifesto. Abroad the Interest was widely translated and read as an explanatory guide to the miraculous economic success of the Dutch."
 ir_men_ned.6.t: "Frederick de Houtman "
 ir_men_ned.6.d: "Frederick de Houtman was born in Gouda, Holland, Seventeen Provinces. He assisted fellow Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser with astronomical observations during the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595–1597 (during which Keyser died). He also sailed in 1598–1599 on a second expedition led by his brother Cornelis de Houtman. Cornelis was killed on that expedition, and Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra, but used his two years of captivity to study the local Malay language and to make astronomical observations. These observations supplemented those made by Keyser on the first expedition. The constellations formed from their observations were first published in 1597 or 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius, and later globes (particularly one published by Willem Blaeu in 1603) incorporated adjustments based on de Houtman's later observations.Today, credit for these constellations is generally assigned jointly to Keyser, de Houtman, and Plancius[1], though some of the underlying stars were known beforehand. The constellations are also widely associated with Johann Bayer, who included them in his celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603. "
 ir_men_ned.7.t: "Adriaen  Block "
 ir_men_ned.7.d: "Adriaen (Aerjan) Block was a Dutch private trader, privateer, and ship's captain who is best known for exploring the coastal and river valley areas between present-day New Jersey and Massachusetts during four voyages from 1611 to 1614, following the 1609 expedition by Henry Hudson. He is noted for possibly having named Block Island, Rhode Island, and establishing early trade with the Native Americans, and for the 1614 map of his last voyage on which many features of the mid-Atlantic region appear for the first time, and on which the term New Netherland is first applied to the region. He is credited with being the first European to enter Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River, and to determine that Manhattan and Long Island are islands."
