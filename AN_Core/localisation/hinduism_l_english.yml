After the funeral, the ashes have been left in your care, along with the ruler's wishes to have them submerged in the water of Ganges, the sacred river.\n\nSince [Root.GetName] is blessed with the presence of the river within its borders, this is not a difficult ordeal. However, the ceremony will still take time out of your duties as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 hindu_events.42.a:0 "This is a good time to seek out the goddess."
 hindu_events.42.a.tt:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will travel to Ganges."
 hindu_events.42.b:0 "I don't have time for grieving."
 hindu_events.43.t:0 "Ganga"
 hindu_events.43.d:0 "Reaching the bank of Ganges, you feel a sense of providence. As you step into the river with the ashes, you envision the water that surrounds you flowing through the three worlds, seeing the darkness of Patala as well as the beauty of Svarga.\n\nAs Ganga once descended to the world and blessed it with her waters, your predecessor's spirit will ascend to the heavens. You feel an unprecedented unity with the goddess and the river, praying that you will once see the end of your life on this sacred shore."

 hindu_events.44.t:0 "Temples of the Sun"
 hindu_events.44.d:0 "Surya is not as venerated as he once was. The Saura who viewed him as the absolute divine are growing ever fewer, and across India, many of the temples that honored him have been neglected or even destroyed. Not every ruler retains dedication to Surya as you do, and iconoclasts of other faiths have put great effort into the demolition of these last bastions of the Supreme Light.\n\nHowever, the temple dedicated to him in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] still stands tall. Under your watchful eye, as well as the eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni, it will never fall. Viewing the fate of other temples as a warning, you are now considering spending more time and money on maintaining the temple."
 hindu_events.44.a:0 "Now, if ever, Lord Surya needs me."

 hindu_events.45.d:0 "While overseeing the maintenance of the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] sun temple, you have also taken the time to pray and meditate within the temple walls. Your determination to preserve this monument to Surya's greatness has grown. You will watch over [Root.GetName] as Surya watches over you, and should anyone try to destroy its temples, your wrath will burn them as the sun scorches the earth."
 hindu_events.45.a:0 "Aum."
 hindu_events.46.t:0 "Changing Seasons"
 hindu_events.46.d:0 "Winter is coming to an end. Surya is turning his chariot and bringing warmth and spring to [Root.GetName]. Usually, this has been celebrated in a simple manner by Surya's devotees in their own homes, but after the work put into the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] sun temple, more and more people seem to gather there. This could be an excellent opportunity to honor the Supreme Light with a larger festival."
 hindu_events.46.a:0 "Welcome all to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], home of Surya!"
 hindu_events.46.a.tt:0 "The festival will be prepared and celebrated publicly in a month."

 hindu_events.47.d:0 "After purifying your body with water and ekka leaves, you walk to the great sun temple in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. People from many castes all over [Root.GetName] have come to bring offerings of water, flowers and fruits and to watch large processions at the temple and palace. The Surya Mandala has been decorated for the celebration and the visiting devotees are united in worship and joy that winter has passed once again."
 hindu_events.47.a:0 "Praise the Sun!"
 hindu_events.48.t:0 "Child of Surya"
 hindu_events.48.d:0 "[Root.GetName] has been without eligible heirs for some time, which has worried members of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family. A princess of the proper lineage has recently given birth to a child who would be next in line to the throne, were it not for the fact that she is unmarried.\n\nBeing versed in the legends of the Mahabharata, however, she recounts the tale of how the great king Karna was born of a virgin by Surya himself. The princess explains that she too learned the mantra by which the princess of legend became pregnant and that her child, the child of the sun, is destined for great things."
 hindu_events.48.a:0 "Surya has blessed us! This shall be the beginning of the Solar Dynasty."
 hindu_events.48.b:0 "Virgin birth? You can tell that story to the Christians."
 hindu_events.49.t:0 "Bala"
 hindu_events.49.d:0 "Your country is at war, and to a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], war is a family business. Your son, [Root.Heir.GetName] has been appointed general and will lead the [Root.GetAdjective] armies to victory. Your daughter has also taken a keen interest in the war, studying warfare alongside her religious education.\n\nOne night, a guru retells the story of Bala Tripurasundari, the young goddess who fought alongside her brothers, who sought for combat out of curiosity. Your daughter listens, transfixed, and learns how Bala's mother again and again tried to curb her child's wish to go to war. When she later approaches you, you already know her request."
 hindu_events.49.a:0 "Go! With the wisdom of the goddess, the enemies of [Root.GetName] shall tremble before you."
 hindu_events.49.b:0 "Youthful curiosity is better directed towards making peace than making war."
 hindu_events.50.t:0 "Guru Meditation"
 hindu_events.50.d:0 "The people as well as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must sometimes rely on the wisdom of holy teachers for advice. A guru is not only a teacher, but also a student of the spiritual and must sometimes withdraw to reflect on it undisturbed. One of the most respected gurus, whose knowledge was frequently sought by the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family, has grown extremely reclusive lately, spending almost all of his time in deep meditation. The court and the people grow restless, viewing this as a bad sign."
 hindu_events.50.a:0 "Certainly a self-fulfilling prophecy..."
