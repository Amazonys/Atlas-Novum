 sikhism_flavor.1.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is situated on the border between adherents of Hinduism and Islam. In this area marked by religious tension and differences, a man named Nanak has started to preach that there is no Hindu or Muslim, but that the truth is with God, who is neither.\n\nAlthough his rejection of ancient customs has outraged devoted [Root.Religion.GetName] believers, Nanak's disregard for caste and creed has allowed his teachings to take root among the population. His disciples are known as Sikhs and are spreading this new faith rapidly throughout [Root.GetName]."

 sikhism_flavor.2.t:0 "Guru Angad"
 sikhism_flavor.2.d:0 "'Death would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly die.'\n\nThe founder of our faith has passed away. Guru Nanak's body is dead, but the spirit of the Guru lives on in his successor, Guru Angad.

 sikhism_flavor.9.t:0 "Guru Tegh Bahadur"
 sikhism_flavor.9.d:0 "The young Guru Har Krishan has tragically passed away. After some confusion about who his successor might be, Tegh Bahadur has been chosen as the new Guru.

 sikhism_flavor.10.t:0 "Guru Gobind Singh"
