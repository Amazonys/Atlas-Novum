 AN_POR_civil_war_complete:0 "Have concluded the §YConflict of Alfarrobeira§! crisis."
 
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.1.t:0 "Conflict of Alfarrobeira"
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.1.d:0 "King Afonso V was only 6 years old when he became king of Portugal. Due to the wildly unpopular machinations of Queen Leonor, protests emerged against her stewardship of the crown, and civil war seemed imminent. However, through the efforts of his uncles Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, and Henrique the Navigator, Duke of Viseu, a peaceful regency was established through political promise and compromise.\nTo appeash the passed-over aging Afonso, Count of Barcelos, the first son of King Juan I, he was given the Duchy of Bragança. Moreover, his sons were promised military titles and his daughter a royal marriage to the upcoming King Afonso V. Instead of keeping to these promises, Pedro instead bestowed the titles of his desceased brothers to his own sons, instead of the Duke of Bragança's.\nIn response, the Duke of Bragança instigated several intrigues framing Pedro and Henrique as usurpers in the eyes of King Afonso V. Now, with the young King ascending to his rightful powers and titles, he has dismissed Pedro as his regent and removed his men from their positions. At the behest of the Duke of Bragança, King Afonso has begun calling his banners to remove the perceived threat posed by his uncles, the Dukes of Coimbra and Viseu. In one final attempt to avoid conflict, Pedro has arrived with his retainers under the banner of peace in hopes of clearing his name and bringing to light the manipulations of the Duke of Bragança..."
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.1.a:0 "It all must be true! We must put down these usurpers!"

 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.2.d:0 "With conflict breaking out between the crown and its noble influences, all manners of rebels are taking to arms against the rightful King. Undoubtedly supported by our internal enemies, these militia are assembling against the crown and seeking riches and glory at the demise of our own fortunes."
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.2.a:0 "Usurper rebels shall receive no quarter!"
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.2.b:0 "More proof of Bragança's intrigues!"
 
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.100.t:0 "Succession Secured"
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.100.d:0 "With the Conflict of Alfarrobeira brought to a close, it is clear that the autonomous duchies are more work than they are worth. Though the nobility shall retain their ancestral privileges, the time has come to reign their territories directly under the dominion of the King of Portugal. Nonetheless, those that supported the crown in its time of need, and those that opposed it, shall not be forgotten..."
 AN_disaster_POR_civil_war.100.a:0 "Afonso shall face no more troubles from meddlesome nobles."

With the annexation of Ainos and collapse of the Byzantines, the titles to these islands have passed to us through some vague relation to the Gattilusio. Thus, the fortunes of these Aegean holdings is now left to our administration."

 AN_loss_of_constantinople.10.d:0 "With the destruction of Byzantium, many of its centuries-old traditions have passed from memory in a mere generation.

 AN_loss_of_malacca.3.d:0 "When we controlled the Straits of Malacca from its titular city, and our capital and court, we were able to fund many military excursions into the lands of Pahang. These days, it is Pahang that is initiating conflict along our border. Indeed, it looks positioned to retake all that it has lost in one well swoop, and perhaps even more."

 AN_loss_of_malacca.4.d:0 "With the instability throughout our realm, the long subdued Sultanate is reasserting itself as an independent power.

 revenge_for_varna.1.t: "Revenge for Varna"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d1: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Hungary has been left in a state of political uncertainty. Under the leadership of regent-elect János Hunyadi, Hungary has quickly reformed its armies and begun to fully concentrate on the existential threat brewing to the south. If Hungary is to maintain its long-term strategic future, the Ottomans must be pushed back, and Varna must be avenged!"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d2: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Serbia has become nominal vassal to the Ottomans under the conditions of the Peace of Szeged. Though Serbia's position was indefensible at the time - necessitating such a humiliating peace deal - however János Hunyadi has offered us a chance to redeem our kingdom and strike the Ottoman menace on our doorstep! On the other hand, the Ottomans would likely repay us for maintaining our loyalty several times over!"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d3: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Wallachia has been at the mercy of the overwhelming Turkish armies. With the loss of riverine fortress such as Giurgiu, Wallachia's only natural defense against the encroaching Ottomans - the Danube - has been nullified. However, János Hunyadi has offered to include us in his attempt to press back the Turks, should we formally hand over feudal territories in Oltenia. Maintaining our neutrality in the conflict could mean keeping those territories and attaining crucial Turkish goodwill..."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d4: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Albania has borne the brunt of the Ottoman advance. Though many Ottoman armies were tied up in Anatolia dealing with the Karamanids, it was still only through Skanderbeg's brilliant leadership that ensured Albania's survival. Now, after repeated requests for Christian help, János Hunyadi has finally come to join the fray. Though, the peace we have achieved with the Ottomans was costly and hard fought for. Though it is appreciated that Hunyadi now seeks our aid, perhaps a chance to rebuild is more valuable than yet another devastating war with the Turks..."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d5: "Since the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Albania has borne the brunt of the Ottoman advance. Though perhaps not directly vulnerable now, the eventual Ottoman threat looms clearly. If we are to maintain any sort of independent sovereignty, we must consider our future carefully. Supporting Albania and halting the Ottoman armies in the Illyric mountains seems the obvious choice. Still, there are some in our court that advocate betrayal of our Christian allies in lieu of a guarantee of independence from the Ottomans."
 revenge_for_varna.1.d6: "Since before the failure of the Crusade of Varna, Bulgaria has been reduced to nought but a shadow of its former self. Shattered into three, and reduced to a single puny territory, the future of Bulgaria seems one of Turkish domination. However, with the call to Balkan Christians being circulated by János Hunyadi, perhaps now is the time to finally retake our lost territories! On the flipside, the power of the Ottomans is unquestionable, having seen it firsthand. Perhaps a more prudent course would be to assist the Ottomans in exchange for local concessions?"
 revenge_for_varna.1.d7: "Bitter in their devastating loss in the ill-advised campaign at Varna, the Christians have only become more agitated by our growing influence in Europe. János Hunyadi, a formidable foe and regent-elect of Hungary is attempting to align the Balkans against us in an attempt to return our advances. We ought to muster our vassals and armies to once again the foolish Christian invaders!"
