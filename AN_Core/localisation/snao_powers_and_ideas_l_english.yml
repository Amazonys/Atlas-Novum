 CHG_ideas: "Chagatai Ideas"
 CHG_ideas_start: "Chagatai Traditions"
 CHG_ideas_bonus: "Chagatai Ambition"
 picking_up_the_pieces: "Picking up the Pieces"
 picking_up_the_pieces_desc: "The pieces of Central Asia are scattered and attempting to unite different places under themselves, but from our vantage point, we can see that it is all futile. Chagatai power is no where near what it used to be, but we must not be complacent with this situation! Chagatai power must and will be restored whether it be by diplomacy or by military authority!"
 unification_of_central_asia: "Unification of Central Asia"
 unification_of_central_asia_desc: "The great Mongol Empire is long gone and so is its most notable successor, the Yuan Dynasty. What remains in the wake of this breakup is a mess of sorts, but nothing that we can't remedy with by properly asserting and enforcing Mongol authority once again. It will be a long journey, but Central Asia will be our foundation for greater ambitions."
 modernize_and_adapt: "Modernize and Adapt"
 modernize_and_adapt_desc: "The age of Khans and cavalry armies are fading into the distant past and it seems obvious that the age of kings and queens, emperors and empresses, and dukes and duchesses are upon us. Chagatai leadership will need to adapt to outside forces influencing our society and our administration by not simply holding onto the traditions of the past forever, but by attempting to reform certain parts of the nation and make peace with what new technologies and concepts lay ahead."
 quick_and_vicious_movement: "Quick and Vicious Movement"
 quick_and_vicious_movement_desc: "Part of the traditions we were left with from the times of the Mongol Empire was the notion of quick and efficient movement of armies, though, most of them back then were composed of cavalry. Even so, today we can impart these ideas on our current military and move from places to place, town to town, and fortress to fortress much quicker than our enemies can."
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters: "Mediate Islam and Buddhist Encounters"
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters_desc: "The paths through Central Asia are filled not with either fully Buddhist nor fully Islamic communities, though, they do come in contact with each other quite frequently in Chagatai lands. By helping the two religions converse and debate with each other in a peaceful manner, we can ease tensions within Chagatai lands when it comes to religious differences."
 chagatai_enforcement_of_islam: "With Islam, there is Authority"
 chagatai_enforcement_of_islam_desc: "The steppe in which we find the lives of our people play out in is spread out with villages and towns being mere small dots on vast swathes of open fields. This means that not only are government institutions weaker generally, but so are religious ones; the latter of which is something that we of the Chagatai Khanate rely heavily on to help control this land. If we can cement Islam more fully in these lands and bring forth more mosques and ulema members, our authority will only grow stronger with time."
 silk_road_trade: "Silk Road Trade"
 silk_road_trade_desc: "Trading with those of the Silk Road, even though it is far from what it used to be in the past, has helped the people of Chagatai prosper and learn of various ideas, including mercenary contracts. It should not be surprising that what we contribute to the Silk Road is also returned to us, just in a different and sometimes even better form, such as cheaper mercenaries."
 reform_the_mongol_empire: "Reform the Mongol Empire"
 reform_the_mongol_empire_desc: "The legacy is larger than life, some say; impossible to fully reclaim, as said by others. Ah, but these people do not know of the power within the Chagatai people, nor do they have the confidence. It will be a meticulous and time-consuming process, but through the blood of many and through times of both peace and war, those of the Chagatai nation will come to reclaim the mantle of the Mongol Empire!"
 NOG_ideas: "Nogai Ideas"
 NOG_ideas_start: "Nogai Traditions"
 NOG_ideas_bonus: "Nogai Ambition"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols: "Confederation of Turkic and Mongol Tribes"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols_desc: "The Nogai Horde was originally a gathering and eventual confederation of about 18 Turkic and Mongol tribes. They formed a powerful and distinct force in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and presented a serious challenge to regional authority from the likes of the Golden Horde."
 the_manghits: "The Manghits"
 the_manghits_desc: "The Manghits were a Mongol tribe that formed a foundational core for our people. Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay: "Centralize the Nogai People"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."
 weak_religious_institutions: "Weak Religious Institutions"
 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."
 khanate_rivalries: "Khanate Rivals"
 khanate_rivalries_desc: "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit. There may only be one with absolute authority out in our homeland, all others are and will be either rivals or subjects!"
 keep_nomadic_traditions: "Keep our Nomadic Traditions"
 keep_nomadic_traditions_desc: "Our nomadic origins aren't easy to change or get rid of; the act of raiding and pillaging hostile land and bringing back loot to our tribes is something we inherited and something we cannot and will not simply give up."
 fluid_political_organization: "Fluid Political Organization"
 fluid_political_organization_desc: "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors. If anything, the way we conduct our politics will help keep our people loyal and content."
 OIR_ideas: "Oirat Ideas"
 OIR_ideas_start: "Oirat Traditions"
 OIR_ideas_bonus: "Oirat Ambition"
 four_major_tribes: "Four Major Tribes"
 four_major_tribes_desc: "The Oirat Horde is dominated by four tribes: the Dzungar, the Torghut, the Dorbet, and the Khoshut. The unification of these tribes means that military matters are able to be handled separately and with both grace and efficiency; we must work to keep these four united and working together so that our power does not wane."
 memory_of_temujin: "Memories of Temujin"
 memory_of_temujin_desc: "Temujin Ghengis made the world tremble before him and his cavalry, but before he ventured out of the region of Mongolia, he first had to contend with various Mongol tribes, such as those that now make up the Oirat Horde. We still hold the memories of the 13th century conquests as something to retrace and the legacy that it left behind, something to be tamed once more... Who else but the Oirat people could see to it that these memories are made a reality once more?"
 ming_rivalry: "Ming Rivalry"
 ming_rivalry_desc: "Our rivalry with the imposters down south, the so-called, 'Ming Dynasty', is nothing short of being on the verge of war at every moment. They desecrated and forced back our Mongolian relatives and now proclaim to be entering into an age of renewed strength, but little do they know that dissenters are spread far and wide throughout Zhongguo (China)! We will take these dissenters and rebels into our ranks and train them ourselves so that we may field them against the Ming Dynasty when war comes upon us."
 fall_of_the_yuan: "Fall of the Yuan Dynasty"
 fall_of_the_yuan_desc: "Founded by Kublai Khan in 1272 and driven out by the Red Turban Rebellion by 1370, then Yuan Dynasty was perhaps the greatest successor to the Mongol Empire established by Temujin. The Oirat Horde are the only serious claimant that might still hold enough power to retake the land the Yuan Dynasty once had. Should the heavens favor us in this endeavor, we can proclaim as the true successors to the Yuan Dynasty and forever seal away the likes of the Ming Dynasty."
 past_the_great_wall: "Past the Great Wall"
 past_the_great_wall_desc: "The Hongwu Emperor and the Yongle Emperor sought to rebuild and revamp the Great Wall in the late 14th century/early 15th century in order to keep the threat of us at bay, but we are nothing if not clever in finding ways around these defenses (or perhaps instead, through these defenses). We will innovate and adjust our tactics to ensure that these fortifications along the north do not stop the horde of cavalry from storming south into the heartland of Zhongguo."
 religious_indifference: "Religious Indifference"
 religious_indifference_desc: "If there is something to be said about religion in the Oirat Horde, it is that it is quite open and free from persecution. We have our own faith, but it is not expected of others to convert and learn of our traditions from the ground up, that would only instill unrest and distrust in people. Rather, a fair amount of religious indifference is key to keeping our people united."
 unification_of_the_mongols: "Unification of the Mongols"
 unification_of_the_mongols_desc: "The Mongols are not simply content with being divided up by foreign powers and pushed back to the steppe. The Oirat Horde retains the ambition to unite the several scattered Mongol tribes into one grand empire that can make the world bow beneath it, and it is the Oirat Horde that shall make this happen."
 SHY_ideas: "Uzbek Ideas"
 SHY_ideas_start: "Uzbek Traditions"
 SHY_ideas_bonus: "Uzbek Ambition"
 reign_over_many_tribes: "Rulership over several Tribes"
 reign_over_many_tribes_desc: "The vast part of the steppe that we claim as the Uzbek domain is full of different tribes whose loyalty, at times, is questionable at best. They do, however, have connection toward different regions where different rulers and khans live; through these tribal ties, we can bolster our own name and reputation from the ground up."
 degrading_golden_horde_influence: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc: "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."
 contest_over_southern_lands: "Southern Conflicts"
 contest_over_southern_lands_desc: "Land in Transoxiana was always rightfully part of the greater Shaybanid domain, but the likes of Timur and his people contested these claims and sought to tear it away. If we are to keep our claim to being the rightful heir the Shaybanid domain, these conflicts in the south must result in Uzbek victory in time."
 settle_issues_with_tribes: "Settle our Internal Issues"
 settle_issues_with_tribes_desc: "The many tribes within the Shaybanid domain are not always peaceful and often times disputes between them, or disputes with them and the governing body, result in often bloody feuds that can destabilize entire parts of our nation. It is time that we organize formal places (buildings, perhaps) where representatives or leaders of tribes meet to discuss and mediate problems they have with each other. The results are bound to shed less blood, much less than prior ones before, at least."
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain: "Consolidate the Shaybanid Domain"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc: "The vast stretches of land we rule across have towns and villages dotting the landscape. They may be few and far between, but we can make them the starting points of proper Uzbek settlments that we can either properly tax or draft soldiers from. It is a matter of centralization over decentralization."
 abulkharids: "The Abulkharids"
 abulkharids_desc: "The Abulkharids are a distinct branch of the larger Shaybanid Dynasty and one of its most famous rulers, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, helped solidify Uzbek dominance across the larger Shaybanid domain. It is through the Abulkharids that we find a solid foundation for unity and strength, and it is by them that at least part of our people are held together."
 ascend_from_nomadic_life: "Ascend from Nomadic Life"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc: "The way of the steppe nomads is not what is used to be. Increasingly there are institutions and nations propagating said institutions that chip away at the foundation of our ancestors way of life. Perhaps it is time for the Uzbek people to settle down and start a new life as a more agrarian people, rather than a nomadic people."
 JIN_ideas: "Jin Ideas"
 JIN_ideas_start: "Jin Traditions"
 JIN_ideas_bonus:  "Jin Ambition"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
 battle_against_former_qin: "The Former Qin"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
 manipulation_of_taoism: "Manipulate Taoism"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "War of the Eight Princes"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
 the_five_barbarians: "The Five Barbarians"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 SHU_ideas: "Shu Ideas"
 SHU_ideas_start: "Shu Traditions"
 SHU_ideas_bonus: "Shu Ambition"
 ancient_shu_state: "Ancient Shu State"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
 zhuge_liang: "Zhuge Liang"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
 defensive_position: "Defensive Position"
 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
 connections_through_trade: "Trade Connections"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 WUU_ideas: "Wun Ideas"
 WUU_ideas_start: "Wun Traditions"
 WUU_ideas_bonus: "Wun Ambition"
 history_of_independence: "History of Independence"
 history_of_independence_desc: "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
 waters_of_wu: "The Waters of Wu"
 waters_of_wu_desc: "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy."
 three_kingdoms_period: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_desc: "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
 promote_coastal_trade: "Promote Coastal Trade"
 promote_coastal_trade_desc: "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via trade?"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period: "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
 the_sun_dynasty: "The Sun Dynasty"
 the_sun_dynasty_desc: "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu. It is through the continuation of the Sun Dynasty that Wu will prosper and maintain itself as a grand and propserous region in China."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 CHC_ideas: "Chu Ideas"
 CHC_ideas_start: "Chu Traditions"
 CHC_ideas_bonus: "Chu Ambition"
 foundation_in_myths: "Foundations in Myths"
 foundation_in_myths_desc: "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
 control_over_central_china: "Control over Central China"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "The Spring and Autumn Period"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
 take_on_gov_corruption: "Take on Government Corruption"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
 qin_chu_rivalry: "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."
 stop_internal_decadence: "Stop Internal Decadence"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "A main facet of our culture in the Spring and Autumn Period and in the subsequent Warring States Period was just how relaxed and laid-back our culture was, so much so that it began to affect society on a much larger scale. Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 battle_of_toulouse_721: "Battle of Toulouse, 721AD"
 battle_of_toulouse_721_desc: "When the Umayyad Caliphate was seeking to invade north into Frankish territory, it was Odo of Aquiitaine who righteously defended the land of Toulouse at this pivotal battle in 721AD. We must remember this historic moment in our history and keep it close to us as we move on throughout time."
 treaty_of_paris_1229: "Treaty of Paris, 1229AD"
 treaty_of_paris_1229_desc: "This treaty was the one in which our region, Occitania, lost its political autonomy and was annexed into the French domain. This wasn't a violent annexation, however, but a sign of our way of marrying into other nations and gaining influence from the inside. Granted, this treaty cost us dearly, we will make sure in the future that marriages and dynastic unions go firmly our way."
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade: "Revenge for our Ancestors"
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade_desc: "The Albigensian Crusade some time ago was a great loss for our people. The wretched Catholics from the north and the Pope himself calling for the execution of the Cathar faith as a whole led to our downfall and it has been hard to recover ever since. It is time we take matters into our own hands and make sure others know that the Albigensian Crusade has not been forgotten."
 the_cathar_faith: "The Cathar Faith"
 the_cathar_faith_desc: "Catharism was rife in Toulouse and Languedoc in the 12th to 14th century, but the Albigensian Crusade put a harsh and bloody blade to the throat of it. Now that Catharism is resurging, we must promote it and take solace in its teachings."
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture: "Occitain Culture"
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture_desc: "A key facet of our culture? Troubadours and and the Occitan language. With both in use as well as the French and Catalan languages mixed in as well, the great culture of Occitania can be the envy of the world and make our nation into a true spectacle on the world stage."
 distinct_identity_from_the_north: "Distinct Identity"
 distinct_identity_from_the_north_desc: "We must remember how different we are from the French people to the north. A distinct language, culture, faith, we are separate from them in so many key ways and we should be proud of it. Our righteous leader will be the prime promoter of our identity no matter what happens to us."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 GUY_ideas_start: "Aquitanian Traditions"
 GUY_ideas_bonus: "Aquitanian Ambition"
 successor_to_the_visigoths: "Successor to the Visigoths"
 successor_to_the_visigoths_desc: "In the 7th to 8th centuries, Aquitaine was subjected to the likes of Roman and Visigothic laws that meshed together to create a sort of hybrid system of administration that did us well. Looking back on this combination of laws and not only reforming it, but codifying it as well, could do the entire nation good."
 carolingian_legacy: "Carolingian Legacy"
 carolingian_legacy_desc: "The complex system of dynasties and counts and fiefdoms inside the Frankish realm was undoubtedly tough to navigate, but the nobles of Aquitaine managed to make prominent strides within it after Pepin I, one of the sons of Charlemagne, and were granted the lands of Aquitaine in 814AD. It is now part of our duty to defend this land with all that we've got, keeping the legacy of our ancestors safe and ensuring our own safety in the process."
 eleanor_of_aquitaine: "Eleanor of Aquitaine"
 eleanor_of_aquitaine_desc: "Perhaps our best known figure, Eleanor of the house of of Poiters and the inheritor of Aquitaine after her father's death navigated the political heights of England and France in the 12th century and kept Aquitaine in good care by her diplomatic and marrital actions. Even though her death lent our land to England's King Henry II, the memory of her and her actions live on."
 hundred_years_war_memories: "Memories of the 100 Years War"
 hundred_years_war_memories_desc: "The terror and horror of the 100 Years War has taught the Aquitanian people many things, one of the foremost being that, we simply cannot and will not neglect our military."
 english_and_french_influences: "English and French Influences"
 english_and_french_influences_desc: "England and France have both tried their hands at taking over Aquitaine and securing it firmly, but such a thing is undoubtedly hard to do. Since we have experiences with both, however, we can take this time to reflect and learn from both sides.

No decisive winner in the past has brought about peace between us two, but without a doubt this feud has led to people joining the ranks of the Shammari military to fight against them.

 alliances_and_rivals_of_italy_desc: "The many powers in Italy know that alliances, marriages, and rivals all play a role in the constant power struggles that occur. It is no secret that all Italian states, no matter how small, wish for a more unified homeland, but that will only occur via bloodshed and unrepentant deals, so we must be the same and do what we can to ensure we are diplomatically on top."
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance: "Stave of Episcopal Dominance"
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance_desc: "The Papacy is a fine figure in Italy, contentious as it may be with the Papal States attempting to secure political authority on top of religious authority. Still, despite our proclamation as an independent republic, they seek to slowly bring the tide of episcopal dominance over us, over Siena as a whole. We must not allow this to happen, no matter the cost; the Republic of Siena must survive!"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans: "Against the Tuscans"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans_desc: "The Tuscans of Italy have always been our rivals and they know this all too well, like we do.

 produce_grand_art: "Produce Grand Art"
 produce_grand_art_desc: "The crown jewel of the republic has to be the blooming industry of fine art. Magnificent paintings and painters produce works of unimaginable grandeur for the likes of royalty, nobility, and the clergy alike and when they make their rounds outside of Siena, they only bring our name further out to different realms, and our prestige, higher than ever before. Who wouldn't want a Sienese art piece, after all?"

 maintain_the_house_of_este_desc: "The House of Este has been with the Duchy of Ferrara since its inception and it's done us well in keeping the people loyal, safe, and productive. We must not let the House of Este fall out of favor, even if they aren't ruling as the formal leaders of Ferrara, since they have built up the duchy to such a height already."
 italian_tensions: "Italian Tensions"
 italian_tensions_desc: "Italy is rife with tension between feuding families and duchies and republics. The time for mercenary regiments is upon us and administrators as well as military personnel know this full well. We must take advantage of this fact and utilize them when needed so that we can sustain our military potential in this time of extreme tension."

 rival_of_venice_desc: "The Venetians are a troublesome bunch, meddling in our affairs and seeking to control all the trade in and around the Adriatic. They aim to destroy the Duchy of Ferrara, whether they say so or not, and we must be ready to stand against these efforts at all points. The people of Ferrara will not live under the flag of Venice, nor any other flag that does not come from the House of Este!"

 promote_high_european_culture_desc: "Ferrara is seen as one of the centers of high culture in Europe as great minds, musicians, architects, and writers are coming through our land and our capital to promote their works.

 cultivate_the_duchy_of_ferrara: "Cultivate Ferrara"
 cultivate_the_duchy_of_ferrara_desc: "Ferrara itself is growing at a fair rate with its people flourishing and the cities expanding steadily. As such, there will be a need enforce laws and regulations more strictly throughout, lest we wish for decadance to take hold of the entirety of the land."
 build_up_the_court_of_ferrara: "Build up our Court"
 build_up_the_court_of_ferrara_desc: "The court of Ferrara itself is rather small in size compared to those of other places in Italy and Europe as a whole. In order to to compare to those larger courts, we will need to expand the range of minds we employ as adivsors and courtiers as well as reform how the court works in general, that way we can streamline matters and expand it over time."
 from_the_hre_to_italy: "From North to South"
 from_the_hre_to_italy_desc: "All around Ferrara there are opportunities for friends and enemies. To the north, the Holy Roman Empire; the south, more Italian land and then the Mediterranean itself, harboring island nations and then the Maghreb. Each path gives us an interesting choice and set of options, but we must be flexible in our negotiations and deals. Ferrara can't survive alone, and enough good friends can go a long way toward making the people of Ferrara loyal and prosperous."

 hre_border_state_desc: "Originally, the Archbishopric of Magdeburg was established near the frontier of the Holy Roman Empire. At the time of the 10th century, it was a much more fearsome place with more threats from tribal people, but now it is what we simply call home. Though, through our legacy as a border state, we've learned to take in and spread knowledge around more so than other states since that was part of our early duties (though, back then, it was more Catholic knowledge than anything else)."

 legacy_of_promoting_christianity_desc: "Ever since we started out, we've been staunch promoters of Christianity to those who were distinctly not Christian.

Some methods may not be pretty, others may go on without any issue, but we will get the job done."
 settle_internal_matters: "Settle Internal Matters"
 settle_internal_matters_desc: "The various conflicts between secular and religious authorities in our land is nothing new.

 consolidate_the_districts_desc: "Communities throuhgout Madgeburg are varying in their origin and background, but they all contribute to the administration as a whole.

 legacy_of_the_great_saxon_revolt_desc: "When the Saxon people revolted in the 12th century, we sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and as such, helped suppress the revolt altogether. We were justly rewarded for our assistance and we gained prominence in the Holy Roman Empire because of it, thus attracting more great minds to our land than before. Today, we continue this tradition rightly and our court is ever the more grand because of it."
 defensive_stance: "Defensive Stance"
 defensive_stance_desc: "Taking the offensive stance is something Magdeburg has rarely ever done. We have been much more focused on internal affairs for quite some time and with such things being sorted, we can focus on ensuring that our defenses are primed and ready. Any invader who comes at the people of Magdeburg will leave in a much worse state than when they came."
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed: "Choosing a Path"
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed_desc: "The Catholic Church is rife with contention and the Protestant Reformation is forcing everyone to choose sides and denominations. The path for Magdeburg lays unclear at the moment, and whatever we think is best for the state is what we must have full trust in."

 former_hindu_center_desc: "The memories of our land being a center of Hinduism is not lost upon us. The beliefs spread by people from centuries still affect us to this day and the shrines and writings from back then remind us of how we must tolerate those of different faiths within our lands. Without a tolerant outlook towards these people, Kedah would be stuck in a constant cycle of strife and destruction."
 influences_from_srivijaya: "Influences from Srivijaya"
 influences_from_srivijaya_desc: "The once mighty empire of Srivijaya stretched its influence far into the north and south, reaching even our lands in Kedah. Though strict control of the land was debatable, they had great influence over us in terms of our maritime traditions and how we protect our coasts."
 chola_empire_influences: "Influences from the Chola Empire"
 chola_empire_influences_desc: "The ships and merchants from the Chola Empire taught the Malay people a great many things about trade routes and mercantile ways, much of which still remain with our people. By utilizing what they've taught our people from so long ago and building upon it, Kedah will be able to garner more power from simply trade routes and trade sectors alone."
 quality_army_of_kedah: "High Quality Army"
 quality_army_of_kedah_desc: "The military of Kedah is something that shouldn't be overlooked. For too long we have relied on tactics and strategies from foreign states where they swear allegiance to foreign lords. Kedah must come up with its own unique tactics and strategies so that its troops will be of the highest quality compared to neighboring states, and states from far away."
 confluence_of_giants: "At the Confluence of Giants"
 confluence_of_giants_desc: "From the north, the Thai kingdoms reign supreme, one after another. From the south, kingdoms and smaller states rock the jungles and waters alike to show dominance. Kedah is at the crossroads of both regions and as a result, hears and witnesses some of these great nations do battle. Kedah and its people must watch and learn carefully as they clash, so that the military of Kedah can build up its own measures against what is currently employed in battle."
 promote_kedah_merchants: "Promote Kedah Merchants"
 promote_kedah_merchants_desc: "As the prominence of Kedah increases, so to do our merchants. In a bid to increase our trade dominance, promoting our own merchants seems like an obvious measure we should take, and one we will actively pursue in the coming time periods. If we don't capitalize on the valuable trade opportunities, our rivals surely will, and we simply must not let that happen."
 protect_the_coasts: "Protect the Coasts"
 protect_the_coasts_desc: "The coastline of Kedah grows ever larger the more we conquer. Thus, the coastal settlements of Kedah deserve protection from foreign ships and amphibious invasions, necessitating the building of a grand fleet of ships capable of driving off any would-be invasion force. Our military will be capable of holding the fortifications and communities down, it is the waters around our land that we must worry about now."

 legacy_of_the_investiture_controversy_desc: "The controversy that led to Pinamonte Bonacolsi taking power in 1273 as Captain General of the People was named the Investiture Controversy and we should count ourselves thankful for it. Mantua, under Pinamonte and his family, grew to be quite prosperous and grand to all states around at the time. It wasn't until 1328 that the last Bonacolsi was ousted from power by the House of Gonzaga, but the legacy left by the Investiture Controversy will never be forgotten by us."

 backroom_deals: "Backroom Deals"
 backroom_deals_desc: "Bribery, coercion, threats, they all fall under the category of 'making deals happen'... They just, take a different approach to making such deals go through. Mantua is no stranger to dealing in these matters and must continue to do so so that it can continue to come out on top of diplomatic endeavors."
 #episcopal_influences: "Episcopal Influences"
 #episcopal_influences_desc: "Being situated in the Italian Peninsula gives us opportunities for a myriad of things, one of which is episcopal influence from the Papacy itself. Though we don't wish to fall under direct authority from the Papal States themselves, more religious authority in the lands of Mantua is most always nice to have."

 artistic_patronage_in_mantuan_blood_desc: "Like many states in the Italian Peninsula, Mantua is fond of the blooming artistic and cultural talent that Italians everywhere are witnessing. Whether it is in the area of artistry or philosophy or some academic subject, we of Mantua are doing our part in patronizing these legends of our time, ushering in a time of innovative ideas coming forth to all places we control."
 the_gonzagas: "The Gonzagas"
 the_gonzagas_desc: "Whether or not the Gonzagas have been good for Mantua is up for debate, but it is safe to say that they've been a stabilizing influence in communities around the land itself. It would be best for us not to stifle them out of Mantua entirely since they do call our land home, at least in part, whilst many other members of the family are out and about in other states. And as time goes on and the influence of the Gonzagas grows, their interest in influencing other realms nearby will also help Mantua secure a safe place in the region."
 mercenary_connections: "Mercenary Connections"
 mercenary_connections_desc: "The vast underground network of mercenary camps and regiments is rife with contracts ready to be taken up and ready to be offered out. Since we are no stranger to using hired soldiers, our reputation with many mercenary groups is better than other nations around us, granting us better rates overall."
 #protect_mantua: "Protect Mantua"
 #protect_mantua_desc: "It is not a want, but a need. The people of Mantua must be protected from the authorities outside its borders. Whether they are French, Italian, German, Iberian, or even Slavic, we must stand ready to defend the ground by which Mantua was raised up on, from a Margravate from the early days onwards to this very moment."
 mantuas_way_with_religion: "Relations through Religion"
 mantuas_way_with_religion_desc: "It is no secret that Mantua has been the host of a decent number of cardinals and even to this day, some cardinals inside the Papacy call Mantua their state of origin. These ties help Mantua reach out to other Catholics whenever such relations are needed and even when trying to influence papal politics, having such cardinals giving some credit to Mantua is always useful."

 remember_the_sarir_dynasty_desc: "One of the first positions of power our people came into was called Sarir. Lasting from about the 5th century to the 12th century, it saw great developments for the Avar people and the cementing of the Avar people in the Caucuses. To this day, we still do claim to be descended from  the Sarir state, although in a different form, giving us legitimacy in the eyes of the Avarian people."

 wars_of_the_caucuses_desc: "The hills and mountains by which we call home are by no means easy to live in, let alone wage war in. Yet, time and time again, the Avar people have routinely fought in these harsh conditions, seeking to maintain their own identity and their own state. It is through these conflicts that we've learned to fend off attrition better, aiding us in prolonged conflicts that see the Avarian people and troops being pushed to the edge."
 alliance_shifts: "Alliance Shifts"
 alliance_shifts_desc: "We've seen several states rise and fall throughout our history in the Caucuses. In order to secure our own safety, we've had to ally various powers from the north, the south, the east, and the west, causing us to have to engage in alliances and diplomacy on all sides. As this is still the case, we must be ready to do this all over again and safeguard our independence by diplomatic means."
 revenge_against_gazikumukh: "Revenge Against Gazikumukh"
 revenge_against_gazikumukh_desc: "The Gazikumukh Samkhalate have claimed to be the rulers of the Avar people and the lands that Avar hold for some time now. Though we vehemently detest this and have tried to fight them off, we failed in the past and were forced into subjugation. One day, though, we can and will have our revenge against the tyrannical power that is Gazikumukh, and the Avar will breathe the air of their ancestors: the air of independence."
 stave_off_the_external_threats: "External Threats"
 stave_off_the_external_threats_desc: "The threats outside of the Caucuses are great and numerous; almost every culture in the region knows it as they've seen numerous invaders come by over the centuries. If the Avar people are to be different, if they are to be ready for these invasions when they come around, adopting improved military technology and bolstering our military potential should be a top priority."

 lessons_of_the_caucuses_desc: "Such is the terrain that we call home, mountains and hills on the northern side of the Caucuses, that invaders often find little room for supply trains on top of sturdy defensive positions that are well built and well stocked. This will continue to be the case and how we set up defenses in our homeland will be a model for how we set up defensive positions elsewhere."

 cultures_of_the_caucuses_desc: "There are several distinct languages, cultures, traditions, and customs here in the Caucuses. From the Alans to the Circassians to the Georgians and many others, we know that they all desire to be left autonomous in some way and accepted for who they are. Being as one from this group of distinct cultures situated in the vast mountains, we can empathize and sympathize with these various groups and come to accept them into our own domain, even though the same was not always done to our people in the past."

 rival_of_central_italy_desc: "The various powers of Italy are all attempting to cut each other down in some way, shape, or form in order to gain the upper hand and we've seen this go on for upwards of centuries now.

 republic_in_sea_of_monarchies_desc: "There are few in Italy, and indeed all of Europe, that think like the Luccans do.

 receeding_hre_influences: "Receeding Holy Roman Empire Influences"
 receeding_hre_influences_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire tried to maintain control over Italy and the minor states within it, but we've been feeling the waning authority of its emperors for some time now. Luccan people no longer should pay fealty to such a far-away lord of different culture, different tongue, and different governing structure; and now that other states are free from the grip of that terrible political project, land will be easier to acquire from our enemies."

 take_on_republican_reforms_desc: "As time goes on and our ideals slowly evolve due to the coming about of new technologies and ideas, the government of Lucca must be ready to reform itself in various ways when the need arises.

The mighty Charlemagne himself built a royal court here and performed certain ceremonies and held important meetings during his reign at Frankfurt itself.

 policing_the_streets_desc: "We empoly a variety of guardians and military protectors within the main city of frankfurt in order to keep order and stability within it.

Though we may not have been able to stop the Christinization of our people, we certainly have been able to stop (or at least slow) the influence of the Livonian Order upon the Livonian people. It is our duty now to take revenge upon the foul crusader order and drive them into the annals of history."

The Curonians, Semigallians, Latgalians, and Selonians all resisted the incoming armored knights baring crosses, and this fighting spirit within them is not lost, even to this very day. By recruiting these people into our ranks, the Livonian military will be a true threat to those around us."

 trade_links_of_mesopotamia_desc: "Trade flows in and out of Mesopotamia regularly and it is quite prosperous on its own. By taking it into our own hands more so than before and inserting our influence where possible, we will profit from Mesopotamian trade routes at an unprecedented rate."
 establish_military_framework: "Establish Military Framework"
 establish_military_framework_desc: "In order to keep Iraq from sinking into the past of military history, we will need to design a proper military framework that we can follow and possibly reform in the future. By doing so, Iraq will be able to keep itself up-to-date with the latest in military thought and strategy and will not be so easily subdued by others."
 behold_al_iraq: "Behold, al-Iraq"
 behold_al_iraq_desc: "Before, there was little hope of a true Iraqi nation. But with our strength and skill, we are well on the way toward providing a safe haven for people who consider themselves 'Iraqi' and who want to see a prospering and grand Iraqi nation. Let us continue to work toward this goal, despite what seeks to hold us back."

 naval_power_of_anatolia_desc: "We are located in a strategic location that allows us the opportunity to get ahead in naval endeavors. Our navy will be more effective in and around the Mediterranean Sea and with dominance on the water, we will have one less thing to worry about."
 mosques_of_mentese: "Mosques of Mentesha"
 mosques_of_mentese_desc: "The moderate yet unique mosques of our beylik are like no others in Anatolia. We have taken careful measures to style them to our own liking and to make them stand out, attracting religious scholars and minds from around Anatolia and even parts of Arabia, the Levant, and other regions. With this in mind, we can become a bastion of Islam in the west if we so choose, and perhaps we should."
 variable_status: "Variable Status"
 variable_status_desc: "Mentese as a beylik was usually in state of being fought over, whether by Tamerlane from the east or by another powerful beylik to the north or inland. Our navigation through murky diplomatic waters is something that has instilled us with a keen eye for good negotiations and allowed us to become more skilled in the matter of diplomacy overall."
 mesut_of_mentese: "Mesut of Mentese"
 mesut_of_mentese_desc: "Mesut was the bey of Mentese from around 1282 to around 1319 and during his lifespan, he fought against the Byzantine army and attempted to take islands off the coast of Southern Anatolia, including Rhodes. Though his deeds were left unheard by many generations, the people of Mentese remember them well and seek to build upon the work he did for Mentese itself."
 fight_for_the_islands: "Fight for the Islands"
 fight_for_the_islands_desc: "The islands in and around the Aegean Sea are crucial for trade and naval purposes and we of Mentese know this all too well. We may have been driven off of Rhodes before and other islands have since broken away from our grasp, but we will be sure to take them back, even if it means having to innovate and use new siege tactics against these now fortified locations."
 take_on_anatolian_trade: "Take on Anatolian Trade"
 take_on_anatolian_trade_desc: "The trade routes of Anatolia and its coastal areas offer strategic interests for Mentese and its merchants as well as its administrators. If we are able to direct more trade into our land and profit off of it then we will undoubtedly be able to monopolize the trade in time and eventually make Mentese a commercial hub unlike any other. Still, this will take time to do and we must be careful with how we approach this matter."

 eastern_beylik_desc: "Our land is the easternmost of the old beyliks that were around after the collapse of the Sultanate of Rum, allowing contact with powers outside of Anatolia itself. Our contacts with the Turkomans, Georgians, as well as other groups of people have allowed us to formalize effective mercenary deals over time and with them in our arsenal, we can ensure a steady supply hired guns that can replace our own men in battle."
 uyghur_mongol_foundations: "Uyghur and Mongol Foundation"
 uyghur_mongol_foundations_desc: "Our founder, Eretna, was originally a Mongol officer and traced his lineage back to the Uyghurs themselves.

 eastern_and_western_fighting_desc: "There are other beyliks to our west and hostile powers to our east that all seek to cut down the Eretnids and force them into submission, but we must not let this happen at any cost! We will fight our enemies on all fronts and defend our land from invasions on all sides! The Eretnids will survive and they will not be defeated so easily!"
 resolve_eretnid_disputes: "Resolve Eretnid Disputes"
 resolve_eretnid_disputes_desc: "If there was key factor that led to our downfall earlier in our history, it was internal dynastic conflicts. An issue of great importance to Eretna as a whole, sorting this matter out sooner rather than later will help ensure internal peace and prevent us from collapsing in on ourselves."
 protective_ties: "Protective Ties"
 protective_ties_desc: "We must not be strong in only our military, but also strong in our diplomacy.

 emulate_our_founder_desc: "Our founder was seen in his day as a scholar and one to be looked up to.

 ilkhanid_influences: "Ilkhanid Influences"
 ilkhanid_influences_desc: "The Ilkhanate held great influence in Anatolia for a short time, but with that influence came with it the influence of more cavalry-oriented military tactics.

 subjugate_the_coastal_beyliks_desc: "The coasts are where we faltered when we first came about. Our once loyal military leaders who led expeditions to the coasts revolted against our authority and successfully broke away, leading to our decline. The times have changed, however, and we will work to see these coastal areas returned to the rightful authority that they belong to: The Germiyanids."
 rein_in_unruly_commanders: "Rein in Unruly Commands"
 rein_in_unruly_commanders_desc: "The command structure of our military is something that lacks real cohesion and merit and its evident when commanders become too powerful and seek to actively disobey our orders. This will be no more in the future and we will enforce a new system, rigid and meritocratic and working to keep military options for Germiyan open and viable."
 western_beylik: "Western Beylik"
 western_beylik_desc: "Since we are situated closer to the western edge of Anatolia, we are more foten in touch with scholars and cultured minds of Europe who bring with them interesting ideas that we have yet to come across.

 beyond_anatolia_desc: "Us, of Dulkadir, are on the edge of Anatolia. To the east lies uncertain potential and danger, but perhaps it holds more opportunity than harm for us if we can navigate the political and diplomatic swamp that swirls around us. It will not be easy, but it is most certainly worth a try."
 buffer_state: "Buffer State"
 buffer_state_desc: "Dulkadir is seen merely as a buffer state in the midst of the 15th century, but there is potential in us hidden deep within. In order to draw that potential out, however, we will need time and resources and in that time, there will be those who want to put a sword to our throat, slashing with mercy. It is our duty to defend what is rightfully Dulkadiri in nature until the time is right to lash out in rigthteous conquest."
 promote_the_dynasty: "Promote the Dynasty"
 promote_the_dynasty_desc: "The dynasty of Dulkadir is one that knows how to spread into other courts. We have connections to other nations around us through marriages and other means, many of which stem from our royal family. If we keep this going and maintain the foundation of the dynasty within Dulkadiri lands, we'll be better set externally as well as internally."
 oghuz_connections: "Oghuz Connections"
 oghuz_connections_desc: "Our ancestors were (and sometimes still are) called the 'Oghuz Turks'. Though seemingly scattered and separated, there are several bands of them still roaming about, serving as mercenaries throughout the lands around us. If we can cooperate with them and perhaps formalize contracts with them, Dulkadir can ensure itself a steady stream of mercenaries for future wars."
 mamluk_ties: "Mamluk Ties"
 mamluk_ties_desc: "The Mamluk Sultanate to our south is something of a worry in more ways than one, but we hold connections to them since many of the trade routes that go to them pass through our land directly. Cultivating this connection over time, even if the Mamluk Sultanate dies out, will result in not only great external assurance, but also internal benefits as well."
 extending_our_influence: "Extending our Influence"
 extending_our_influence_desc: "As the years go by, Dulkadir finds itself growing more and more aware of how far its influence goes in the world around it.

 tensions_with_mamluk_sultanate_desc: "The Levant and Egypt itself are in the control of the Mamluk Sultanate. Though there are times where we cooperate with them, there is undoubtedly a sense of tension between us and them. We must be on watch and be ready to take action whenever they are weak, or whenever they feel as though attacking us is a good idea."
 adana_buffer: "Adana Buffer"
 adana_buffer_desc: "Our lands are not only a crossing point between the regions of Anatolia and the Levant, but it is also inherently valuable as a defensive position to plot and launch an invasion from as well as a place to help control the trade routes of the Eastern Mediterranean. It would do us good if utilized Adana to its full extent and began recruiting men for a larger and more formal army that only the Ramazani people could train and maintain."
 settle_the_land: "Settle the Land"
 settle_the_land_desc: "The land of Adana remains largely untapped in its potential for agriculture and other resources. If we take to settling more of our people properly and with formal land grants and property rights, we can make much better use of Adana over time and extract a greater amount of wealth in the future."
 turkish_settlers: "Turkish Settlers"
 turkish_settlers_desc: "Turkish people have come through to settle the lands for upwards of a many generations now.

 naval_power_from_smyrna_desc: "Smyrna is where our naval power spread out from. Though it wasn't always in our hands, when it was, we made extensive use of it and made sure that all those within range of the city could feel our presence. Let us once again do as such and take on those who would try to take down the Aydinids."

 revenge_for_the_smyrniote_crusades_desc: "Two times did Pope Clement VI call for a crusade against our former leader, Umur Beg, for getting involved in the Byzantine Civil War of 1343-1351. Though the result was less than favorable for us, the Aydinids stayed strong and resisted the crusades to the very end in 1402. This example still inspires our people to this day, giving us hope to take revenge for what was done to us."
 securing_aegean_trade: "Securing Aegean Trade"
 securing_aegean_trade_desc: "The trade routes flowing through the Aegean Sea call to us, just asking to be raided, but they also call to us to be controlled for the interests of the Aydinids in general. Perhaps we can siphon income from the sea for ourselves and maybe elsewhere and pirate the rest that doesn't belong to us?"
 changes_from_tamerlane: "Changes from Tamerlane"
 changes_from_tamerlane_desc: "When Tamerlane came through and fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anatolia, we too were changed in many ways.

 establish_aydinid_architecture: "Aydinid Architecture"
 establish_aydinid_architecture_desc: "The monuments we left behind from our founding are still around to this day, scattered around and slowly decaying without proper maintenance.

Breaking away at the Gediz River and seizing considerable power for himself, the Saruhan Beylik would come to be quite powerful under his authority and we must strive to emulate this."
 emirate_of_germiyan: "Emirate of Germiyan"
 emirate_of_germiyan_desc: "Due to our ties to the Germiyanids, our court is occupied by scholars and courtiers of similar cultures. Even when we expand and incorporate different people into our court, we will be sure to privilege those of our tongue and customs over those unlike us so that we can have a more unified and less complex system of adivsors and scholars."

 great_mosque_at_manisa_desc: "At Manisa lies a grand mosque built by our people.

 rival_of_the_byzantines_desc: "We have had several contentions with teh Byzantines in the past and we remember them well. Skirmishes on land and at sea has led us to rethink and reform how we perform military tactics and strategy, giving us crucial insight into how we should be in the future."
 gunpowder_innovations: "Gunpowder Innovations"
 gunpowder_innovations_desc: "As time goes on, the Saruhanids are becoming more and more familiar with gunpowder weapons and their potential. By investing time and energy into refining them and perfecting them, perhaps nothing will stand in the way of the Saruhanids from obtaining absolute control of Anatolia and beyond.

 zoroastrian_legacy_desc: "The pious nature of the Yazdi people has been known since the time of the Sassanids. Though faiths change over time, the effort our people put into making their faith as true and as great as can be can be seen when Zoroastrianism was still dominant in Persia. Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."
 difficulties_of_yazd: "The Difficulties of Yazd"
 difficulties_of_yazd_desc: "Yazd is not only a difficult place to live, but it is also a difficult place to fight inside of. The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."

 capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty_desc: "The Muzaffarid Dynasty may have had but a brief life in Persia, but they had their capital at one point stationed in Yazd itself. Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."
 haven_in_persia: "Haven in Persia"
 haven_in_persia_desc: "For a long time now, we've been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere who are fleeing persecution or are in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."
 silk_weaving_industry: "Silk Weaving Industry"
 silk_weaving_industry_desc: "A commodity and wondrous material, silk, is readily produced in Yazd and its patterns and production are unique to Yazd itself (or so some say).

 sassanian_roots: "Sassanian Roots"
 sassanian_roots_desc: "Yazd itself is named after the Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire, Yazdegerd I.

 uniting_persia_desc: "The pieces of Persia lay scattered and divided, fighting for dominance after the fall of Timur and in the face of threats from the north, west, and the east. However hard of a goal it might be to reach, the ambition to unite Persia once more under a single dynasty that is stable and righteous is what Yazd is set out to do.

 remember_count_adolf_of_nassau_desc: "Count Adolf of Nassau was elected Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298 and although he was weak in his authority due to the nature of the Holy Roman Empire and the electors wanting a weak emperor in the first place, his election brought about the land of Nassau onto the forefront of politics at the time. If we are to do this once more and bring Nassau to the forefront of matters throughout Central Europe, diplomacy must not be overlooked and being open and ready to whatever diplomatic intrigue that grants favor our way must be welcome by Nassau."

 dynastic_politics_desc: "The nature of dynasties being intertwined with politics is nothing new to us, and if we utilize our connections throughout Europe correctly, we can enssure that our dynastic politics help cushion any blow dealt to us in the future."
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau: "Reformation Fervor in Nassau"
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has broken Europe up into several fragments with religion dividing them, alongside politics itself. Nassau itself must be ready to use this fervor to its advantage when it comes to defending itself via military force, and who knows, perhaps we can snag ourselves some cheaper mercenaries along the way due to the chaos and destruction occuring."
 dynastic_branches: "Dynastic Branching Paths"
 dynastic_branches_desc: "As our dynasty spreads into other realms and courts, it will undoubtedly start to become fragmented at points, taking on slightly different characteristics as time goes on.

 struggling_for_steppe_control_desc: "Wresting control of the steppe is never an easy task, not since the great Mongol Empire fell some time ago. Though we are not the best candidate to take hold of the chaotic region that we call home, we can refine ourselves and prove our worth in this effort."
 fall_of_the_golden_horde: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 fall_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With the fall of the Golden Horde to the west, power in Central Asia is scattered and people are looking for strong leadership wherever it presents itself.

 rivals_to_our_east_desc: "The east was home to the Chagatai and the Great Yuan, but now there merely hollow remnants in their place.

 cultures_of_the_steppe_desc: "The vast realm that is the steppe is home to a myriad of different languages and cultures, many of which see each other as rivals and enemies.

 expanding_our_internal_domain_desc: "Within the lands of the Kazakh, there are those who obey the leaders with little question, and those who hear very little from the leaders at all.

 modernize_our_tactics_desc: "Time and time again, we are seeing the tactics of old run into issues against the modern weapons used predominantly by Europeans and those they trade with. Perhaps investing time and effort into modernization efforts for our military could yield positive results; our old tactics may be kept in books and documents for future use, but if the Kazakh military is to keep itself afloat, there must be some effort to reform and the military itself."

 utilize_corsairs_desc: "The tradition of pirating and using corsairs for shady interests is well known throughout Algiers and our navy is especially adept at it. If we invest in improvements into training and the materials and weapons used by our corsairs, maybe we can see a boost in profits? Or maybe we can see more ships come into our fold when they engage in battles on the high seas; enemy ships are always useful, whether its for scrap material or for use in our own fleet."

 import_gunpowder_weaponry_desc: "We are often used to the traditional methods of doing warfare in North Africa: blades, spears, bows-and-arrows, crossbows, and armor of some kind. This, however, is slowly becoming outdated as more and more we are seeing 'firearms' show up on the field of battle and being used by both infantry and cavalry. Algiers is nothing if not adaptable and will take to integrating these new weapons into the military so that they are not chained to the combat tactics of old."

Fortifications are nice and good, and we will build some, but the desert is its own fortification, hand-crafted by nature itself for thousands of years."
 champion_naval_combat: "Champions of Naval Combat"
 champion_naval_combat_desc: "Trial by combat at sea is what Algerian sailors must endure, and each of our sailors that has passed the trial has proven to be a true champion out on the water. Whether they are raiding coasts, fending off enemy fleets, or doing 'private' contracts along certain trade routes, the Algerians know that they can and will be the champions of naval combat."
 algiers_city_of_refuge: "A City of Refuge"
 algiers_city_of_refuge_desc: "Algiers doesn't practice a very staunch version of Islam, normally,a nd the city of Algiers itself, a blossoming flower in the harshness of North Africa, is by no means a place of persecution for those seeking safety from other places. We will take these persecuted poeple in and promote Algiers itself, along with its other connected cities around the region, as a place of refuge and renewed prosperity."
 algerian_waters: "Algerian Waters"
 algerian_waters_desc: "The coasts of North Africa are divided, and the islands of the Mediterranean are home to various divisions of people who pay fealty to meanial lords and rulers. Let Algiers be the one who unites these disparate people and ports into one nation, and let the Mediterranean Sea be the home of the Algerians and those who come to be accepted within the wider realm of Algeria."

 islam_and_berber_society: "Islam and berber Society"
 islam_and_berber_society_desc: "Berbers have long lived on their before the Arabs arrived and began spreading Islam. Though the time has long passed since Islam was introduced and accepted into our societies, there are still tensions abound with Islam's various interpretations and teachings. It would serve us well if we were to mediate these differences peacefully and in a righteous manner, rather than hastily choosing one side and promoting violence against another side."
 nomadic_roots: "Nomadic Roots"
 nomadic_roots_desc: "Berbers have long since been nomadic, roaming the vast deserts and arid parts of North Africa for generations and only some times gathering into settlements. Though we're much different now and we have legitimate cities and towns, our nomadic heritage never has truly gone away and it still helps us move our people faster and with more efficiency whilst also extending our reach with trade routes."
 endless_mercenary_ties: "Endless Mercenary Ties"
 endless_mercenary_ties_desc: "Vast is the pool of mercenaries that the Berber people can employ. Various tribes all around the region of North Africa are willing to be hired as mercenaries and this is well known to all Berber leaders, meaning that the nigh endless supply of them can make for cheaper frontline personnel."
 harness_the_desert: "Harness the Desert"
 harness_the_desert_desc: "Few can match our adapability when it comes to living amongst the sands of the desert and the arid terrain of North Africa. We can make use out of it better than most anyone else can, and if we continue to do so, none will be able to strike a deadly blow against us."
 the_many_berber_dynasties: "Many Berber Dynasties"
 the_many_berber_dynasties_desc: "Berbers have long since held positions of power since the time of the Umayyad Caliphate and its aftermath. Strong Berber dynasties dotted the landscape of both North Africa and the overall timeline of Islamic North Africa for centuries and that has not changed in the slightest; we merely see some rise, and some fall, and the cycle continues on without end, seemingly. Let us take our place in the light and show the others around us that we too are part of these grand dynasties of our people!"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith: "Making Amends with our Family in Faith"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith_desc: "Though we may be mostly united in faith, there are parts of our society that are undoubtedly in a state of 'heresy' to a degree and they are resistant to any form of conversion. The solution for them is to not kill them outright and to cause widespread unrest for unjust murders, but, rather to attempt to cooperate with them and see to it that they are understood and reconciled with. Social cohesion is something Berber states need as times change, and a Berber family united in faith, to some degree, is better than a Berber family fighting itself over such matters."
 uniting_the_maghreb: "Uniting the Maghreb"
 uniting_the_maghreb_desc: "What is the goal of all Berbers who rule a state in North Africa? To see a unified power that can tame and unite the divided region into one single nation. True to the past it isn't easy to try for, but the Maghreb must know peace one day, under one flag that comes from the people native to it."

 ancient_memories: "Ancient Memories"
 ancient_memories_desc: "We have a long tradition in the region of France, with settlements in our area dating back to the times of the Gallic tribes. Deriving our name from the 'Arverni' tribe that fiercly resisted the Romans under the leader Vercingetorix, Aurvergne today still remembers much of its history and keeps it close, whether it is in the field of battle or in the streets of every day society."
 developments_of_auvergne: "Developments in Auvergne"
 developments_of_auvergne_desc: "The 10th through 13th century were some of the best times for the Auvergnese people. Churches and abbeys and other structures were done during this time period, leading to a fairly propserous and autonomous area that was loved by its own people. It is high time we continue these developments and introduce new and updated infrastructure so that Auvergne may rise in stature once more."
 safe_from_conflicts: "Safe from Conflicts"
 safe_from_conflicts_desc: "Thanks to our positio in the region, we have been relatively safe from conflicts such as the Hundred Years' War and various plauges from around Europe. Such safety is valued by both peasants and nobles alike, leading to increased social cohesion and in the end, higher profit margins in the area of producing resources."
 take_back_our_autonomy: "Take back our Autonomy"
 take_back_our_autonomy_desc: "It was King Philip II of France who, in the late 12th to early 13th century, ended our autonomy in the French region. Though peasants may not have cared, the administrative body and the nobles surely did not like this and to this day, there are those who still desire autonomy once more. Perhaps it is time we take it back and ready ourselves for when there is resistance to our demands."
 promote_french_culture: "Promote French Culture"
 promote_french_culture_desc: "Though distinct as we are in the French region as we speak 'Auvergnat', a variant of the Occitan language from further south, French culture (with a tinge of Auvergnese flavor added in) is still dominant in our land. The promotion of it in our court and slowly promoting it around us through our friends and allies will ensure that we are never short of friendly neighbors in the future."
 technological_interests: "Technological Interests"
 technological_interests_desc: "Focusing on the present is one thing, but looking to the far flung future and what it holds is something few around us rarely do. Auvergne has always and will continue to hold itself to this higher standard, looking toward the future and seeking new technologies and insights where others do not, or cannot."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 BOU_ideas_bonus: "Bourbonnean Ambition"
 siegneur_de_bourbon: "Siegneur de Bourbon"
 siegneur_de_bourbon_desc: "Though it is a bit of an outdated title, the Seigneur of Bourbon was what our rulers would be called from the period of 913 - 1327. Reclaiming the title, however, will undoubtedly give us and our people a sense of distinguished identity in the French region; after we reclaim it, keeping ourselves in good standing with the people will ensure that we are viewed as the legitimate rulers of Bourbonnais."
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon: "First House of Bourbon"
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon_desc: "The first run of power we had was under the first House of Bourbon, which was more or less founded by Aymon I. Charles the Simple gave him the land that are considered today 'Bourbonnais' and it is through his legacy from the first House of Bourbon that we help reinforce our authority over the land."
 ties_to_burgundy: "Ties to Burgundy"
 ties_to_burgundy_desc: "After the death of the last dynastic member of the second House of Bourbon, Archambaut IX, who died in Cyprus whilst crusading in 1249, was the one who left our land in a state of question and uncertainty. The House of Burgundy took charge afterwards and subsequently acquired the land of Bourbonnais afterwards, thus giving us external ties to what became a rival of France itself. Perhaps we can use these outside ties again in the future? It'd surely be to our benefit if we could, and did."
 defending_our_claims: "Defending our Claims"
 defending_our_claims_desc: "Our claims on the land around us, especially in the French region, are legitimate and firmly within our rights to take and annex into the lands of Bourbonnais. If those around us or around the land in question wish to challenge the authority of Bourbonnais on these claims, we will defend them vigorously with our finest noble officers riding forth gloriously against the enemy."
 royalty_in_france_proper: "Royalty in France"
 royalty_in_france_proper_desc: "The 'House of Bourbon' is still quite the renowned name in French lands; even the name 'Bourbon' is still spoken in high regard or with the knowledge that there is considerable prestige and behind the name itself. Now is the time to start building off this prestige and grandeur given to us by the people of France, and we will begin with a reformation and bolstering of the Bourbonnean soldiers."
 grace_from_charles_iv: "Grace from Charles IV"
 grace_from_charles_iv_desc: "Charles IV, last dynastic member of the House of Capet, was the one who greatly aided Bourbonnais in the early 14th century. Under him, the alliance between the Bourbons and royalty of France itself prospered and subsequently Bourbonnais was elevated to the status of 'duchy', granting us more legitimacy and prestige throughout France. If we can capitalize on this old granting of power and ride our prestige and legitimacy into the new ages ahead, Bourbonnais will become a power that none will be able to match."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region.

 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy: "Seat of the Avignon Papacy"
 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy_desc: "The memory lives on from when Avignon was the seat of power in the Catholic Church. The curia itself was moved to Avignon on March 9t, 1309 and until 1403, it remained a prime contestant for Papal power as the Papal Schism went on. Too many are forgetting when we were triumphant and powerful... Soon they will remember what made our city grand, and the people of Avignon, revered."
 avignon_exchange: "The Avignon Exchange"
 avignon_exchange_desc: "As one of the first sites of a foreign exchange market, we take pride in retaining this title and the luxuries that came with the Avignon Exchange. Not only did it promomt trade, but money lenders also found themselves at home here and with them on our side, securing beneficial loans and monetary advances will be all the more easier for us."
 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes: "Renovate the Palais des Papes"
 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes_desc: "Though not in use by the Papacy anymore, the palace and fortress her still serve important purposes for Avignon as a whole. Displaying our opulence and wealth and willingness to defend our land, renovating the Palais des Papes and keeping it in working order will undoubtedly help us learn how to fortifiy and keep our other lands outside of Avignon safe."
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon: "Advances of Avignon"
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon_desc: "The papal library and University of Avignon are some of the greatest works we have still after the fall of the last Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII. Retaining the knowledge that both produced and keeping them functioning for the city and the administration is of the utmost importance to us and Avignonese society as whole."
 build_upon_previous_developments: "Building upon our Developments"
 build_upon_previous_developments_desc: "The previous developments within Avignon, whether they be in terms of infrastructure to help bolster our society or administrative measures to assert our authority, must be constantly compounded upon for better and more lasting results. We must work things harder, make things better, do things faster, so that we, of Avignon, are stronger."
 revenge_for_the_papal_schism: "Revenge for the Papal Schism"
 revenge_for_the_papal_schism_desc: "The great Papal Schism that once empowered Avignon as a place of grandeur and wonder may be over now, but the scar it left on us is not forgotten. Revenge will be had for cutting down what once gave us prominence and power; we will take back what is rightfully ours."
 restoration_of_avignon_authority: "Restoration of Avignonese Authority"
 restoration_of_avignon_authority_desc: "The time has come to march forth and proclaim the authority of Avignon once more. Let those who oppose the might of our holy fury cower in fear or die before our weapons of steel and fire, and let those inside Avignon know that they are safe from any that wish to harm them."

 NRM_ideas_bonus: "Norman Ambition"
 ancient_contention: "Ancient Contention"
 ancient_contention_desc: "The region of Normandy has been a place rife with tension since it is valuable to those of the Isles to the north and to those just to our south. Though the tensions have often caused the Norman people much in the way of strife, it has also made us ready for whatever comes our way next."
 chateau_de_rouen: "Chateau de Rouen"
 chateau_de_rouen_desc:"The Chateau de Rouen may be a symbol of French authority, but we can turn it from being such a thing. If we centralize our power enough amongst the Norman administration and ensure that the chateau itself is safe and maintained, it will become a symbol of Norman authority rather than just French authority."
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter: "The Norman Charter"
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter_desc: "The Norman Charter of 1315 was the one piece of legislation that kept Normandy afloat and at least somewhat independent of royal authority, especially during that time period since authority from the French in Paris was faltering. We will take to the Norman Charter and refine it over time, building upon what administrative qualities it instituted into Normandy itself."
 empower_norman_administrators: "Empower Norman Administrators"
 empower_norman_administrators_desc: "Keeping in line with our independent nature, we will be using more Norman administrators in our government than French ones. Those of Paris and the central part of the French region can keep to their houses and manors, the Norman people will be the ones put in charge as only they can judge and rule Normandy correctly. Once they are set in Normandy though, perhaps they can help our other lands become more centralized too? We can only hope and try."
 channel_ambitions: "Channel Ambitions"
 channel_ambitions_desc: "The Channel is one the key body of water we need to be concerned with as it holds access to the lands of the Isles and our own coasts. Trade goes into and out of the Channel and it would do us good to make sure that these routes of trade are secure for the Norman people, as opposed to others around us."
 norman_revival: "Norman Revival"
 norman_revival_desc: "Gone will the days be of the French and English attempting to subjugate us in their own names; there will be a true Norman state, for the Norman people, and it will be glorious as it goes on through history! Let our soldiers carry forth our banners proudly with skill unmatched by our enemies, and a will unbreakable by those who would want to tear us down!"

 cohesion_in_the_deccan: "Cohesion in the Deccan"
 cohesion_in_the_deccan_desc: "Our position in the region known as the Deccan is tenuous and subject to influence from seveal different shahs and rajas around us. The people of Berar must know unity and peace with each other if they are to ever see the light of tomorrow in a solemn peace the resonates throughout the entirety of the land."
 setup_forges_and_foundries: "Setup Forges and Foundries"
 setup_forges_and_foundries_desc: "Incoming foreigners occasionally bring with them strange weapons they call 'firearms' that use and explosive powder called 'gunpowder'. Though some are reluctant to use such weapons, our engineers and military officers are keen on seeing how they perform in combat against our enemies; some of the wealthy individuals from our military are even willing ot put up the money to start producing such weapons inside Berar. Since it is isn't our money going into these facilities, why stop them from being built?"
 modernizing_weaponry: "Modernizing our Weapons"
 modernizing_weaponry_desc: "The age of warfare is changing all throughout India and beyond. Slowly but surely the enemies around Berar are gaining these weapons too, thus making the battlefield equal once more. We don't need this, we need to make it favored to us once again throughout investments into new military technology and refinements in our current military weapons."
 fortification_artillery: "Fortification Artillery"
 fortification_artillery_desc: "Fortifications around Berar are fine on their own, but they lack the punch to retaliate against our enemies when they come under siege. If we begin to use artillery from defensive positions from our fortifications against besieging armies, perhaps we can also use this knowledge later on when we other armies in battle? Field artillery is something of great interest to our military officers and perhaps investing in the concept now will pay off later for Berar."
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar: "Reforming the Berari Succession"
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar_desc: "We must not focus purely on one aspect of Berar and neglecy others, especially when we can see the crumbling of various dynasties around us from time to time. We must take to reforming the succession laws of Berar and instituting more refined and strict rules regarding which heir is eligble for the throne so that in the future we can avoid succession struggles."
 meritocratic_military_organization: "Merit over Blood"
 meritocratic_military_organization_desc: "The time has come for us to phase out the aging method of nobles leading our armies into battle. Too many times has Berar seen its good men cut down by a leader who was supposed to be bright and capable because he was born of a grand family tree, no, this must change for the Berari military. There will be military academies set up and there will be skill-based recruitment of commanders; the nobles deserve less than we give them."
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression: "Sustain Ourselves from Aggression"
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression_desc: "The rivals around us show no signs of resting, and neither do we. For decades now, the Berari people have focused on outward expansion and neglected to think of their own safety and their own walls that should keep them safe. Perhaps it is time for a slight shift, for, defensive measures are also in the interests of Berar, just as offensive measures are."
 GOC_ideas: "Golcanda Ideas"
 GOC_ideas_start: "Golconda Traditions"
 GOC_ideas_bonus: "Golconda Ambition"
 persian_origins: "Persian Origins"
 persian_origins_desc: "Our nobles and rulers can trace their origins to the region of Persia itself, bringing with them a plethora of knowledge and ideas from outside India. Spreading these ideas and fusing them with Indian ideas on various matters can lead to a rich cultural exchange that Golconda would be foolish to not look into and take advantage of."
 patronize_learning_and_buildings: "Patronize Learning and Buildings"
 patronize_learning_and_buildings_desc: "Though our origins lay far away, we have come to adopt the language and customs of the Telugu and surrounding people groups. Combining our knowledge from Persia with the likes of Indian and Muslim engineers to construct elaborate structures that are both prestigious and functional will allow Golconda to flourish in the future in the fields of innovation and grandeur."
 golconda_diamonds: "Golconda Diamonds"
 golconda_diamonds_desc: "The rich diamond mine within our territory provides wealth beyond belief, as some would say. Though we carefully cultivate the production of diamonds and gems in our land, we should not be so strict that we inadvertently hinder our income. Reworking and refining our production methods over time will likely ensure that profit margins are firmly in favor of Golconda."
 golconda_fort: "Golconda Fort"
 golconda_fort_desc: "The fortress within our capital is not something that should be taken lightly. It is our duty to keep it taken care of and manned whenever necessary so as to keep our capital safe from invaders, but also to help be an example of how to build future fortifications in different areas we come to control."
 adopt_deccani_culture: "Adopting Deccani Culture"
 adopt_deccani_culture_desc: "The myriad of peopel groups in the Deccan are briming with opportunity, but also tension, and the administrators of Golconda can see this quite clearly. There must be sustained efforts by our administration to adopt and integrate these different groups of people in the Deccan into Golconda as a whole, thus making Golconda more unified as a whole."
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire: "Against the Vijayanagara Empire"
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire_desc: "To our south is the mighty and fearsome Vijayanagara Empire. Though powerful in many ways, we of Golconda are powerful as well and not willing to let the wrath of the Vijayanagara Empire wash over our land without a fight. To the very last man, Golconda will fight! The Sultanate of Bahmanis may not have been able to do this, but we succeed where they failed at and hold off the threats from the south!"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate: "Centralize the Sultanate"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate_desc: "As time moves forward, so to do our people. It won't be long before new technologies present new challenges to our authority, which is why we will need more active efforts to centralize power throughout the land into an orderly form. It won't be easy, but it will be worth the effort in the end."

 sufis_of_bijapur_desc: "The gracious sufis of our land have been here since a couple centuries ago, helping form communities become more in line with Islam itself and also promoting the connections between Hindu and Muslim communities spread throughout. Despite harsh treatment early on in their arrival, the sufis have since increased in number and have brought a sense of wider community to Bijapur as a whole."
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture: "Commerical and Cultural Hub"
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture_desc: "Our capital is something of a gem in the central part of India. Being a place of great commerce and culture, our leaders know how to cultivate a thriving hub of merchants and civilians alike as they come from different backgrounds and different regions. Let us continue this great trend and build up our capital to be an economic and cultural heart in India, greater than the cities in the north like Delhi and Lahore!"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan: "The Palmyra of the Deccan"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan_desc: "Bijapur, due to our efforts in making sure it is a place for culture and commerce and a place where people from all over India can come and feel as though they are at home, is being nicknamed the 'Palmyra of the Deccan'. The namy 'Palmyra' may be a bit lost on us, but it brings with it apparent prestige and good tidings, so we will gladly adopt it."
 southward_ambitions: "Southward Ambitions"
 southward_ambitions_desc: "The south is where our most fearsome competition lies, rather than the north. The Hindu leaders that oppose our might and who would see Bijapur fall into disrepair will know our might and the superiority of our troops; our ambitions will be satiated once we secure the southern realms, and after that, perhaps even other areas."
 new_age_of_indian_warfare: "New Age of Indian Warfare"
 new_age_of_indian_warfare_desc: "Gunpowder is continuously making its way into the field of battle at every turn. From two-handed weapons to full on cannons that can breach the walls of stone fortresses, the soldiers of Bijapur are going to need to adapt to this new age of warfare and be the first to use it effectively in India."
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals: "Develop Water Systems and Hospitals"
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals_desc: "The water systems of India are often lacking in how clean they are and how refined they could be, as are the hospitals and medical areas around the region. Bijapur has scholars from around its land who are ready to help innovate on both of these fronts if we take them up on their offers, letting the people of Bijapur know both increased health and an increased quality of life."
 institute_educational_systems: "Institute Educational Systems"
 institute_educational_systems_desc: "One common controversey that keeps coming up amongst the population of Bijapur is education. More classical ways of education may have been fine in the past for our ancestors, but in a time of increasingly diversifying ways of thought, especially on how education should be conducted and instituted in Bijapuri land, we must be open to new ways of thinking and reforming what we have in place. Bijapur must not be stuck in the past."

 fall_of_bahmanis: "Fall of Bahmanis"
 fall_of_bahmanis_desc: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis is a mere decaying remnant of the past and its successors are here to stay. We of Ahmednagar will be the most righteous and fearsome of the successors, uniting the Deccan either through diplomacy or conquest."
 the_fall_of_daulatabad_fort: "The Capture of Daulatabad"
 the_fall_of_daulatabad_fort_desc: "The mighty citadel at Daulatabad stood as a hefty barrier for the Sultanate of Bahmanis, but they have fallen from grace now and have left vast amounts of land and power open for the taking. With our taking of Daulatabad early on, we learned just how important it was to focus on siege tactics and what a prolonged siege requires, making Ahmednagari forces all the better in prolonged wars."
 distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans: "Distinguished in the Deccan"
 distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans_desc: "The Deccan requires strong leadership and dedicated sultans to lead it! The people in the region cannot be left to the hungry powers of Orissa, Gujarat, Malwa, or the Vijayanagara Empire, no, Ahmednagar must prove itself worthy as a righteous Muslim state that can succeed where the Bahmani sultans failed."
 blood_on_the_royal_dynasty: "Blood on our Dynasty"
 blood_on_the_royal_dynasty_desc: "Whilst we are sorting out many things in Ahmednagar, from agricultural reforms to tax laws and so much more, we are faced with the fact that our succession to the throne is not always secure and clear. We need to ensure that previous bloody feuds between advisors and family members of our dynasty are sorted out through courts so that a clear heir may be found and put forth for Ahmednagar."
 reformation_of_revenue_intake: "Ahmednagari Taxation Reform"
 reformation_of_revenue_intake_desc: "Being focused on warfare and politics for so long makes it so that we lack the ability to focus on other key areas. Other regions such as the Gangetic Plain and the Bengal Delta are working toward land and taxation reforms that Ahmednagar could seriously stand to benefit from. Perhaps we can send envoys to these places to bring back details of these reforms."
 ahmednagar_renovations: "Frontier Fortifications"
 ahmednagar_renovations_desc: "We cannot neglect the fortifications scattered around Ahmednagar as time goes on. Sure they may have been good at the time they were built, but we need to be maintainers of these fortifications as well, improving them whenever we can with improved materials or new designs."
 persianate_acceptance: "Akin to the Persian World"
 persianate_acceptance_desc: "Much like the cities of Isfahan, Herat, and Tabriz, Ahmednagar (the city) must be a haven not just for those of Persian descent, but rather it must be a haven for all who wish to be part of its growing culture, expansive neighborhoods, and thriving business community. We cannot just turn away Gujarati, Oriya, and Marathi people and deny them access to our great city if we wish to continue to prosper."

 one_of_the_four_ancient_powers_desc: "In the times of our ancestors, back when the Spring and Autumn Period was still fresh in the minds of the Chinese people, Qi was one of the powers that stood out. Withstanding various attacks and incorporating different groups of people into their state back then, there are many that still harbor good feelings toward us. Let us use this to our advantage as we go forth."
 cultural_works_of_qi: "Cultural Works of Qi"
 cultural_works_of_qi_desc: "The cultural works of our ancestors are still evident today. Meshing and melding with the various Chinese cultures other than our own has taught us a myriad of lessons, one of which being that we must be accepting of more people within our domain if we are to function properly and efficiently."
 learn_from_the_northern_qi: "Learn from the Northern Qi"
 learn_from_the_northern_qi_desc: "Much like the Southern Qi, the Northern Qi was plagued with issues during its short time in the mid-6th century. From corrupt officials to poor quality armies and internal conflicts raging, the Northern Qi are nowhere near the proudest moment for the name 'Qi', but they are ripe to learn from."
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi: "Lessons of the Southern Qi"
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc: "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government. The arbitrary executions carried out and curtailing of certain officials for menial reasons must be learned from, for the banners of Qi must not be stained with horrid acts that destroy the nation from the inside out."
 reformation_of_military_ranks: "Reformation of Military Ranks"
 reformation_of_military_ranks_desc: "Cleaning up the mess that is the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, and the military ranks of Qi are something that will be needed in order to help clean up said mess. Reforming them and instituting long lasting military education into our armies will help achieve smarter and more effective military minds that will, in time, instill discipline into our armies."
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court: "Cultivate a Cohesive Court"
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court_desc: "The court of Qi is the central part of matters where things can and have gone wrong in the past.

 tenuous_stance_by_french_royalty_desc: "The French nobility have never been truly fond of the Foixien people and their local rulers, which is why we are only emboldened when they come knocking at our doors for undue fealty.

Those of Dauphine were part of this rise in localized power and were at first an Imperial Fief of the Holy Roman Empire, but soon were under French rulership.

 the_savoy_daphine_conflicts_desc: "In the 12th century, early in the history of Dauphine itself, the borders were much less firm and much more subject to change. As a result, when titles were changed and cities shifted hands, power struggles emerged over miscommunication and various disputes, the prime example we have being the disputes between Savoy and Dauphine over cities like Voiron and la Cota-Saint-Andre and the Faucigny. Such conflicts do not fade into history so easily and we retain the potential to claim land that our ancestors once had."

 sort_out_the_noble_feuds_desc: "Nobles fueding with each other is one of the utmost problems that we can face as a state and nation. Quarrels between them can last years and drain several resources from Dauphine itself, which we absolutely do not want or need.

The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."

In these turbulent times, politics have shifted and a new age is upon the people of the Tang Dynasty, an age that will see them reclaim what they lost so long ago.

 revise_succession_laws: "Revise Succession Laws"
 revise_succession_laws_desc: "One of the key factors that undercut An Lushan and his rebellion after he proclaimed the Great Yan Dynasty was the matter of succession, for his son did end up killing him in the end, causing a major succession struggle to ensue. What we need is a reformation of succession laws and how our heirs rank in comparison to each other so that we do not suffer what An Lushan did."
 soldiers_from_many_regions: "Soldiers from many Regions"
 soldiers_from_many_regions_desc: "Part of the nature of An Lushan's rebellion was that it was multi-ethnic. People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."

 help_from_the_north_desc: "Shatuo Turks were of importance to the Later Liang due to the fact that Emperor Taizu had to maintain tense relations with them since he had a previous rivalry with Li Keyong, governor of Shanxi province. Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain.

 tenuous_chinese_authority_desc: "We find ourselves far from any firm authority from the Middle Kingdom itself. Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth. With this in mind, we are often left to ourselves and governing our land in the ways we have cultivated over the centuries is much better when compared to top-down laws of force by the Chinese from afar."

It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."

Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on.

 foundations_from_the_zhou_desc: "The Zhou Dynasty is still looked upon with prestige in the annals of history within the Middle Kingdom, and within the Zhou Dynasty came forth the designated area where we, those of the Qin Dynasty, rose up from.

 shang_yang_promoting_legalism_desc: "The type of legalism promoted by Shang Yang to the military and administration of the Qin Dynasty after the Zhou Dynasty fell from grace was the type that made the fighters of our state ruthless and efficient.

It is this legacy that we of the resurgent Qin Dynasty keep to."

 developments_of_the_qin_capital_desc: "Not only did Shang Yang promote legalism to the Qin Dynasty, he also promoted the development of the capital itself through infrastructure investments.

 ready_for_military_reforms_desc: "Part of the strength of the Qin Dynasty was its capability of adopting military reforms and innovations for itself as this proved crucial in the Spring and Autumn Period that preceeded the formalization of the Qin Dynasty. This spirit of adaptation in military matters is something that we are still ready for today as new technologies come to us and our officers."
 strong_political_and_peasent_base: "Strong Political and Citizen Base"
 strong_political_and_peasent_base_desc: "Legalism was foundational to our power, but it alone could not have propelled the Qin Dynasty to prominence.

 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."

By investing effort and time into mining these places, we will see profits for the Hakka people that match what is needed for a prosperous future."

We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end.

 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."

 carve_out_a_place_for_the_hakka_desc: "The existence of the Hakka people has been one of turmoil and chaos, full of unrest and persecution from various groups in the Middle Kingdom.

 resisting_central_chinese_authority: "Resisting Central Chinese Authority"
 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."

 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be.

 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally.

 connections_to_the_vietnamese_desc: "The Yue people are connected to the Viet people in at least some tangential fashion and this is evident through our history that dates back to the Nanyue Kingdom.

 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom: "The Great Nanyue Kingdom"
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom_desc: "Though seemingly gone from the memory of many, the Nanyue Kingdom is still around in the hearts and minds of several Yue people.

 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."

 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty_desc: "One of the sons of Wang Shenzhi rebelled against him and proclaimed himself the 'Yin Dynasty', a bitter memory in which we are eager to stamp out entirely.

 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang_desc: "The Southern Tang took advantage of the disunity within the Min Kingdom and our allegiance to Wuyue was not able to hold off the onslaught of the Southern Tang. We must learn from the lessons in warfare they taught us and curate a better and more robust military, starting from the core of things: the infantry."
 out_of_isolation: "Out of Isolation"
 out_of_isolation_desc: "The trade routes through the coastal waters may seem to be a good way at getting us out of isolation, but in truth they only get us contacts, not formal relations.

 marriage_and_purchase_desc: "Through the expertise of our old counts, Armagnac increased in both size and power throughout the 13th and 14th century.

As such, we have garnered a considerable amount of influence around us, and even more power within our own domain."

 no_to_the_black_prince_desc: "When Edward the Black Prince was given control over our lands in 1360, he sought to use the Armagnac people to his advantage. Taxes beyond belief were levied from the people, but they said no and refused his harsh authority and instead appealed to the French royal court instead. It is this resistance to the English and favoring of those who understand us better, those of French descent, that we must keep alive."
 enemies_of_burgundy: "Enemies of Burgundy"
 enemies_of_burgundy_desc: "The feudal politics of the early 15th century resulted in hostile sentiment being stirred against Burgundy within Armagnac. Though we aren't as keen to be under direct royal authority from Paris, the Burgundians are even worse and as such, the people of Armagnac are slowly uniting against these foul people in order to rid them of Europe once and for all."

 armagnac_mercenaries_desc: "The Armagnacs, formed by Count Bernard VII, may be vicious and fearsome and often hard to lock down in formal contracts of service, but they know their origins in Armagnac itself. Though most were incorporated into the French military itself, there are still bands out there, ready to serve as grand mercenaries once more if we are willing to pay the price."
 sustain_armagnac_power: "Sustain Armagnac Power"
 sustain_armagnac_power_desc: "The usage of the Armagnacs previously has not only helped garner good tidings with them, but even military tactics and strategies are being shared with them too.

 resist_the_royal_domain_desc: "We are on the outer reaches of the French region, far from where royal power is absolute and easily enforced. We must resist the encroachment of these royalists at any cost, whether it is turning away their diplomatic intrigue or fighting their knights and soldiers on the field. Undoubtedly they will want to rein us in, but we will resist as much as we can in order to see an independent and glorious Armagnac."

Even her descendants continued this path of expansion and brought Bar to grand prominence as a de facto independent border state betwixt the Germans and the French people. It is because of her that we owe our existence and fortune."

 french_politics_over_german_politics_desc: "In deciding which side of the fence we'd be on, our French lineage dictated that we side with and become entrenched in French politics over German politics.

 using_the_status_of_duchy_desc: "Being a duchy carries weight when speaking to others in the French region and even those in neighboring regions.

 fortify_the_lands_of_bar_desc: "Being initially a border state of sorts has had a inherent defensive affect on us. We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure.

Conquest will not come about easily and the lands of our ancestors are now filled with people who would see the Pandyan Dynasty and its descendants go extinct, but we will turn the tide and spread flowers of fire against them, both from above and from above and in front of them, just as our ancestors did similar with arrows and spears."

 descendants_of_the_ay_dynasty_desc: "Though they seem like a distant memory now, the Ay Vel chiefs of centuries ago helped lay the foundations for Venad. It was they, and other members of the Ay Dynasty, that helped build up and connect the lands of Venad to other parts of Tamilakam  and when they the Ay Dynasty was partitioned in two by competing dynasties (these being the Pandyas and the Cheras), Venad helped carry forth their legacy."

 survivors_of_the_destruction_of_the_chera_desc: "The destruction of the Chera Kingdom was a very tumultuous time for the people of Venad as uncertainty lay everywhere at the time. Would the people of Venad once again be subject to foreign rule? The answer would be no, but the memories of the Chera Kingdom prove to be everlasting in Venad itself and as such, the rulers of our land sometimes go by the title 'Venad Cheras', giving legitimacy in the eyes of the great many who still remember the times of old."
 resisting_muslim_invasions: "Resisting Muslim Invasions"
 resisting_muslim_invasions_desc: "From far in the north did they come. Some time ago, our former ruler Aditya Varma resisted the likes of strange Muslim invaders on the borders of Venad, but that was not the last we saw of them. These Muslims often carry with them different tactics and weaponry that we of Venad are not used to and as such will need to adapt to fending them off. Once we have defensive measures secured, ensuring that a defensive, well-supplied military force that can fend off any future invasions will be needed."
 uniting_kerala: "Uniting Kerala"
 uniting_kerala_desc: "The ambitious ones of our land think that we can extend the likes of Venad to all parts of Tamilakam, but that is but a dream for Venad at this point. Our first goal must be to unite the kingdoms of Kerala and enforce authority over them; it is only then that we will be able to think about expansion effort elsewhere."

 protecting_venad_coasts_desc: "The lucrative coasts along Kerala have been exporting spices for as long as anyone can remember. True to this, we have a vested interest in keeping these coasts safe and particularly profitable, necessitating protection from ships belonging to the most illustrious and grand kingdom around: Venad."
 fighting_against_the_pandyas: "Fighting Against the Pandyas"
 fighting_against_the_pandyas_desc: "The Pandyas to our east may have been beaten back before, but they still pose a threat to the likes of Venad. We will use any and all means of warfare to beat back our sworn rivals and once we are done with them, we will take what we learned from the intense fighting and refine our military with the knowledge. The only good Pandyan state, is a dead one."

 fixed_villages_of_the_wichita_desc: "Our settlements are well known and becoming more and more expansive as time goes on. Several developments are being made to help promote them as centers of population growth and some in our higher circles are thinking that it is high time that we establish other fixed villages elsewhere to promote Wichita authority and prosperity. If we can organize this effort properly and gather enough people for it, perhaps there will be truth to this idea after all."

 a_wichita_confederation_desc: "Though the different branches of the Wichita people are separated by distance, there is unity between them. Even some have drifted away from us and have intermingled with other tribes, but still they retain loyalty to the greater Wichita whole and as such, we have the grounds for a confederation, transcending past tribal roots and into something greater."

 marking_the_wichita_people_desc: "If there is one thing we will retain as we go on throughout time, it is the marking of our people around the eyes. It is significant in our culture and also serves to mark our people as distinct from others around us. It is a rather simple, but effective tradition that will serve to keep the Wichita people known and our society, distinct."
 formalize_the_wichita_military: "Formalize the Wichita Military"
 formalize_the_wichita_military_desc: "To go along with the foundations of a Wichita confederation of people, there will need to be a reformation of military structures. Tribal levies will no longer do and our old tactics must be refined and combined with newer ones in order to ensure proper deployment, engagement, and disengagement. It will take some time to do, but as an upcoming nation, there is plenty of time, resources, and will to get it done."

 formalize_arapaho_divisons_desc: "The Arapaho people have traditionally been divided into five groups: the 'Southern People', the 'Rock People', the 'Arapaho Proper', the 'Big Lodge People', and the 'White Clay People'. By formalizing these divisions and introducing reforms to help divide up administrative tasks equally and fairly, the governing body of the Arapaho people will become more efficient."

 connections_to_and_after_the_second_cheras_desc: "After the disappeareance of the Second Cheras in the early 12th century, Kolathunad and the Kolathiris were one of the benefactors in the partition of the kingdom. With their memory still around amidst the people of Kolathunad, there is a certain reputation that we have for being seen as a sort of successor to them. With this reputation, people of Tamil lineage often come to our court looking for work in a state seen as the proper successor to the Second Cheras, which we style ourselves as."

 source_of_heirs_to_others_desc: "If there is one thing that Koluthnad has been known for to others around Kerala and elsewhere in India, it is that we are a source of viable heirs for other dynasties. Though we may not have claimed thrones and titles like others might have, the children chosen as heirs for other dynasties have grown to be strong members and as such our reputation to those around us is something beyond just 'a neighbor'."

Other things may change around the state, but the court is where we see the past and present meet and come into harmonious contact with each other.

 six_major_apache_speaking_groups_desc: "The major groups of Apache speaking people may not be as close-knit as other groups of similarly speaking people, but we still recognize and commonality between all of us and that there should be unity over feuding. Though this doesn't always work out, it does for the most part and serves to bring more plentiful amounts of fighters for the Apache."

 early_nomadic_traditions_desc: "There was a time when we migrated to a great number of places and across vast amounts of land, hunting and seeking survival in the various conditions around us. Though we are not nearly as nomadic as before, the traditions that came with that way of life still influence the Apache people and make them much quicker on their feet."

 taking_to_settled_life_desc: "Settled life is something rather strange to some Apache people, but to most it is the natural progression from where we once were.

 tribal_exchanges: "Tribal Exchanges"

 partition_of_the_second_cheras_desc: "The fragmenting and partition of the Second Chera Empire changed the landscape of Tamilakam forever. The would-be successors all vied for land and no state directly related to them could attain the power they used to hold. Still, the remnants that live on today, us being one of them, are seen as the legitimate successors who carry on the legacy of this once great dynasty."

 conquer_by_courting_and_conferring_death_desc: "The Ernad Utayavar (governor) was given a royal sword by the last Cherman Perumal, Rama Varma Kulasekhara; with it, he was given the order to 'conquer by courting and conferring death', and with this motiviation and authority, he set out to conquer the territories of the kingdom of Polanad and beyond. It is this foundation from the Eradis that we obtain our military prowess from, and it something we must never forget."
 strategic_coastal_access:  "Strategic Coasts"
 strategic_coastal_access_desc: "The land on the coast of Kozhikode (Calicut) is rife with potential and for maritime trade, as our neighbors have no doubt exploited over the years.

 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals: "Lessons from Internal Struggles"
 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals_desc: "Before Kozhikode was a unified state, there were several rivals vying for dominance through countless conflicts and dynastic disputes. The title 'Samoothiri of Kozhikode' came about as a result trials and tribulations internally that hardened the people of the area into ones that are ready to face any threat against them, whether they are from within Tamilakam or outside of it."
 matrilineal_succession_system: "Matrilinial Succession System"
 matrilineal_succession_system_desc: "Though it may come as an unusual system to those outside of Kerala, the way of succession in Kozhikode is matrilineal in nature and has been so for centuries now. Keeping this tradition and ensuring it does not become interrupted or rife with corruption is a top priority for us as the system itself helps keep the populace and the administration satiated."
 implement_superior_economic_policies: "Implement Superior Economic Policies"
 implement_superior_economic_policies_desc: "The Samoothiri of Kozhikode must have a keen eye not only for administrative matters and military affairs, but also for economic policies. The waters around Southern India and the trade routes snaking throughout the region are rife with potential for increased revenue, especially through the port at Kozhikode, but we must be ready to put through policies that are directly beneficial to this."
 patronize_religious_scholars: "Patronize Religious Scholars"
 patronize_religious_scholars_desc: "Religious scholars from several places have travelled to Kozhikode to make a living from trading, but several have also looked to settle down in our land to promote theological debate and religious conversion. Though we are less than eager to let them simply convert our people to a different religion, there is wisdom in letting them live in peace and harmony within Kozhikode along with patronizing the unique religious works they produce."

Time and time again they come against the people of Kochin looking to subjugate them and the Raja of the land, but we must turn back these incursions whenever they approach! Revenge is what will be had by our people for the wounds they have inflicted upon us and we will be triumphant!"
 head_of_all_temples: "The Head of All Temples"
 head_of_all_temples_desc: "The Maharaja of Kochin may also be called the Gangadhara Kovil Adhikaarikal (Head of all Temples). With the Maharaja being the one to lead Kochin politically and also be a large religious figure within Kochin, they must also be able to be flexible in when using this title as new arrivals from different religious begin to come to our land for long-term trading purposes and long-term settlements."

 memory_of_the_last_chera_desc: "One of our ancestors from the area of Perumpadappu was spouse of the sister of the last Chera king, Rama Varma Kulashekhara. Because of this connection to the last true Chera, our ancestors obtained rights to not only temples and certain festivals, but also the legitimacy that the Chera Dynasty imposed upon its descendants. It would be wise of us to use this lineage to our advantage later on, should people question how legitimate our authority is."

 matrilineal_succession_in_the_royal_family_desc: "The royal family of Kochin practices a matrilineal form of succession and it often helps bring about a stable and relatively easy line of succession. Though some troublesome people appear in the dynastic lineage, there is no shortage of heirs in this system that dates back centuries."

 rekindle_far_off_diplomacy_desc: "When our rivals from Kozhikode tried to subjugate us, the people from far off lands in the east (this being the Ming Dynasty) attempted to mediate and thankfully sided with us instead of our devious rival. Though that connection to the eastern power is long gone and that fateful admiral who helped us is no longer around, we have the ambition and skill to rekindle this diplomacy from afar. Perhaps it won't just reach that old eastern power, but perhaps other places as well."

 cultivate_the_port_at_vypin_desc: "The island of Puthuvippu (Vypin) was created by a major flood in about 1341, but this flood did not bring with it pure destruction. This key island has now become a hub for our trade network and if we continue to cultivate it further, it can become a serious power in South Indian trade markets, perhaps even rivaling some of the other ports that have been prominent in the past."

 patronize_srirangam_temple_and_others_desc: "The Srirangam Temple is perhaps one of the most stunning and awe-inspiring temples in our land, being a hub for Sri Vaishnavism and several other Hindus following other branches of Hinduism. Continued patronage of this central temple as well as the others of our land will undoubtedly garner us great praise, but also strategic tax and construction benefits for the future."

It is foundational to agricultural life and is something few powers seem to focus on, but our rulers know just how important it is for the growth and well-being of a society.

Simplistic in name, but unique in construction and layout, it serves as a model to build off of that is both uniquely defensive and self-sustaining.

 expand_gingees_trade_sector_desc: "Trade is increasingly becoming the life-blood of several states in Southern India. Taxation has its benefits, but the waters around Southern India are highly valuable and worth so much more than simple taxation at times, so who are we to just sit around and let that trade revenue sit on its own? We are going to actively promote and invest in the Gingee trade sector, that is what we'll do! Just as our neighbors are doing for themselves!"
 influencing_neighboring_politics: "Influence Neighboring Politics"
 influencing_neighboring_politics_desc: "The surrounding states of Gingee are full of local politics and we do understand this, but influence leaks into others states, whether it is ours into theirs or vice versa.

 far_off_relations: "Far Away Relations"
 far_off_relations_desc: "The trade routes and politics of our neighbors has naturally led us to meeting far off states that are unlike Gingee in the slightest. They may follow different religions, have different customs, and fight in a completely different manner, but that doesn't mean we can't try to have good tidings with them at first and later on. From first impressions to long-term diplomatic relationships, Gingee must be an expert in diplomatic matters at all times."

 techniques_of_vijayangar_desc: "Though they are unjust at times, we cannot deny the fact that the Vijayanagara Empire has had its benefits for us of Keladi.

We would be foolish to throw these lessons away and to start from scratch."

 reform_agricultural_and_taxation_methods_desc: "An age old practice it is, in a sense, but it is always needed: land reform. Keladi is no different in this sense, with us needing to reform how land is distributed and tilled and taxed.

 against_the_marathas_desc: "The Marathas are perhaps our most powerful rivals in India as a whole. Largely made up of warriors willing to fight for their own state and their own selves, we have known them as a direct threat for a long time now and as such have learned better methods and techniques of fighting overall.

 fortifications_of_arcot: "Fortifications of Arcot"
 fortifications_of_arcot_desc: "For a long time, Arcot at the heart of our nation has been a sight of great fortifications. They have been compounded upon over the decades, and still prove effective in preparing the defenders of Carnatic for whatever may come for them. Keeping them in place and emulating them outwards toward other fortifications will help our defensive measures later on."

 unity_with_religious_communities_desc: "Those of various religions are scattered throughout Carnatic, but they are not without a voice.

 far_off_connections: "Far Off Connections"
 far_off_connections_desc: "True to our position of importance, we have far off trading connections that see Maldivian traders and merchants regularly.

To the ends of the ocean will our ships of trade reach!"

 protecting_the_atolls_desc: "Just as the waters around us are lucrative and vast, they are open to other ships from nations hostile to us.

 arabic_ties_and_administrative_tongue: "The Arabic Language"

By using Arabic, however, we are able to utilize more innovations in administrative affairs that they bring along and truly there some astounding innovations that comes to us from the likes of Arabia itself. We'd be wise to use these in our own governing body."
 capitalize_on_our_importance: "Capitalize on our Importance"
 capitalize_on_our_importance_desc: "To say the Maldives is important is putting it lightly. We are a key stopping point for several trade routes and for good reasons. If we can capitalize on this fact and ensure that trade in the Maldives is safe and prosperous, more and more people will come to us to conduct mercantile agreements and trade overall. We can become a true economic powerhouse if we just learn how to utilize our position well."

True to our nature as an economic and trading giant in the Indian Ocean, we will make sure that the export of these fine goods is not hindered in the slightest, but rather increased as time goes on so that the Maldives can continue it's overall dominance."

 removers_of_the_itzas_desc: "The fiends that are the Itzas, they did not deserve to hold the power they held and as such we removed them once before from Chichen Itza.

 after_the_end_of_mayapan_desc: "What precipitated the end of the League of Mayapan was the disastrous civil war between us and the Cocomes.

With this backing, we will take back what is rightfully ours."

It was not, however, destined to last as some centuries later, it all came apart in a disastrous civil war, causing the cities to break away one by one.

 meomries_of_our_old_empire_desc: "Our once ancient empire descended from the hills and out in the valleys below, but it did not stretch far compared to what some polities around us today reach.

 monte_alban_our_old_heart_desc: "Our old empire's heart was the populous center of Monte Alban. It was here that the Zapotec people thrived and expanded from for centuries before being eclipsed by other cities, but who is to say this old heart of ours is left to rot? There is life in it yet, and the Zapotec people can still revitalize it and become the grand political entity it once was, but even greater!"

 reform_zapotec_writing_and_language_desc: "Our writing and language systems are some of the oldest in the region, but like others around us, it gets mixed together and changed around thanks to the influence of other cultures around us.

 holophrastic_language_desc: "The language of the Abenaki is 'holophrastic' in nature, different enough to those around us that it is hard to communicate with them regularly as languages continue to grow and evolve over time.

 learning_from_our_enemies_the_iroquois: "Learning from the Iroquois"
 learning_from_our_enemies_the_iroquois_desc: "The enemies of our people, the Iroquois, are not without their merits. They have made war against several people related to us and have little mercy on our people, but they do cultivate some interesting characteristics in society, such as formalized expansion and settlements. Perhaps it is time that the Abenaki learn from this and take to making our own settlements to rival them."
 techniques_from_surrounding_combat: "Learning from Surrounding Combat"
 techniques_from_surrounding_combat_desc: "Around us, we have had conflicts with several people groups and tribes seeking to plunder our wealth and to completely take over the land of the Abenaki. We must take steps to learn from these conflicts of the past; we must refine our skills in combat, both formal and informal as raids are important to warfare just as much as pitched battles are."
 well_meaning_abenaki_people: "Well-Meaning Abenaki People"
 well_meaning_abenaki_people_desc: "We have been described by foreigners, despite how different we are, as docile and ingenious.

 highly_deliberative_decision_making: "Highly Deliberative Decision Making"
 highly_deliberative_decision_making_desc: "The administration of the Abenaki people is very tedious and deliberative in the decision it makes. The foundation of it is meant to be in touch with the common Abenaki people of our land, making decisions that are good for not only the good of them, but for the good of everyone who is Abenaki. It is tough to pass legislation at times, but it helps keep the people content and our administration running smoothly."

 continue_the_story_telling_desc: "The story-telling tradition of our ancestors has been with for generation upon generation and each one builds upon it with new stories from their experiences.

 formation_of_the_iron_confederacy_desc: "There is a need for strength not simply obtained by staying as we are.

We will create, in time, the Iron Confederacy to better defend and administrate ourselves."
 assiniboine_political_power: "Assiniboine Political Power"
 assiniboine_political_power_desc: "Our political authority in our land is known by all, but outwards it is rarely recognized. The Assiniboine are stronger than many think, and the proclamation of ourselves as true confederacy over a mere tribe is a mark of this; those who stand against us are foolish to do so. Those that we conquer will join us and know peace under our just authority."
 semi_nomadic_traditions: "Semi-Nomadic Traditions"
 semi_nomadic_traditions_desc: "The lands around us necessitated that we use both agricultural and nomadic ways of life in conjunction with each other. It is not easy to mesh these two together, but we have managed to do so over the ages and have learned a great many things about decentralization and efficient movement of supplies and people."
 modernize_trade_relations: "Modernize Trade Relations"
 modernize_trade_relations_desc: "With the coming wave of new technologies and mercantile methods, the Assiniboine are at risk of losing out on valuable trading opportunities.

 diversify_and_adapt_economically: "Adapating our Economy"
 diversify_and_adapt_economically_desc: "The environment around our people is changing and the animals from before are no longer as plentiful as they once were. This is going to create a crisis within our society if we do not diversify and adapt the economy to the upcoming problems and we will do just that: invest in various other areas of viable resource extraction and refinement so as to help our people and our economy prosper and become more resistant to changes in global trends."

 the_original_three_peoples: "The Original Three Peoples"
 the_original_three_peoples_desc: "The Blackfoot are not merely one people group, but rather, three separate tribal nations merged into one confederacy of sorts. The Piikáni, Káínaa, and the Siksikáwa all come together long ago into this confederation since they all spoke the same language and shared kinship between them. It is from the confederation that we find foundational power and solace."
 flexible_bands_for_blackfoot_society: "Flexibility in our Bands"
 flexible_bands_for_blackfoot_society_desc: "The bands of Blackfoot society are highly decentralized in that, they may vary in size greatly (80 - 240 people). They are constantly shifting around in both how large they are and how they break up and reform since they are allowed to do as such with little consequence. This system of decentralization yet social cohesion allows us to keep the confederacy strong and united."
 promote_the_warrior_societies: "Blackfoot Warrior Societies"
 promote_the_warrior_societies_desc: "Though we may see unification in our people, outside there are those who would see us torn apart. That is why we value the warriors of our land and the socieites within our own that train young men to become strong fighters for the Blackfoot.

 expanding_blackfoot_grounds: "Expanding Blackfoot Grounds"
 expanding_blackfoot_grounds_desc: "As time goes forth, the borders of the Blackfoot expand and so do the number of bands we have within our land. It isn't uncommon to hear people petitioning for new land to be settled beyond what we call home; perhaps these petitions can be put to good use?"
 taming_the_plains_by_force: "Taming the Plains"
 taming_the_plains_by_force_desc: "The plains by which we come from are by no means friendly to us. Rival people groups seek our destruction and treasure for themselves, but with the arrival of these new foreigners, perhaps the plains we call home can become something more useful. The only issue being? We must use force to tame those who inhabit the plains, and we will do as such."
 the_use_of_bison: "The Use of Bison"
 the_use_of_bison_desc: "Bison! Used by all within Blackfoot society, the great creature is almost sacred to us, as some might think. Regardless if it is or isn't, we use all parts of the bison when possible and make sure no parts of it go to waste. Spreading this mentality of using anything and everything when possible and viable is a rather efficient mindset and should serve to improve the productivity of Blackfoot people."
 neutrality_in_various_affairs: "Diplomatic Neutrality"
 neutrality_in_various_affairs_desc: "Conflicts around us are not isolated in the slightest. There are those who try to draw us into various diplomatic affairs that could lead to dire circumstances later on, something we'd rather avoid if we can.

 memory_of_magha_the_tyrant_desc: "Kalinga Magha was the one who established our kingdom in the midst of the 13th century and was the first member of the Aryacakravarti Dynasty. His invasion and conquest was so harsh and so complete that it resulted in a major migration of Sinhalese people southward on the island itself. Such a reputation is prestigious in its own right, and the methods of ensuring authority and stability within his kingdom back then are not lost on the people of Jaffna today."
 two_capitals_of_nallur_and_puttalam: "The Two Capitals"
 two_capitals_of_nallur_and_puttalam_desc: "Our two capitals of Nallur and Puttalam are useful in that, they switch between being our official capital regularly when the seasons change for pearling. It may be a strange system to others, but it has worked for us for so long now, why change it? The productive nature of having two capitals is something that we embrace, rather than reject."
 diversify_the_economy_of_jaffna: "Diversify the Economy"
 diversify_the_economy_of_jaffna_desc: "Trading in the Indian Ocean comes with its own set of issues and benefits. The states around us are actively adapting to the nature of trading in it and Jaffna should be no exception.

 ties_with_southern_india: "Ties with Southern India"
 ties_with_southern_india_desc: "We are seen as a haven for refugees and dissidents on the coasts of Southern India. Routinely we will have arrivals of people who are fleeing because of political strife or community problems and we welcome them, sometimes on certain conditions. These who seek refuge are, after all, quite useful as possible agents or insurgents back from where they came, especially if we arm them ourselves."
 buddhist_sinhalese_people: "Buddhist Sinhalese People"
 buddhist_sinhalese_people_desc: "The Buddhist population on the island we call home is significant enough to take note of.

 organized_military_payment_system_desc: "What helped us stand out amongst the other kingdoms around us was the rather unique miltary payment system we had built up for ourselves.

 fighting_the_osage_and_co: "Fighting Rival Tribes"
 fighting_the_osage_and_co_desc: "The rivers attracted several people before and still do today. Thus, control over the rivers is not universal and we have had to assert Caddo authority over certain parts when necessary. This legacy of fighting for control of fertile grounds is something we must keep true to ourselves as our life-blood and ancestry are at stake when our control of the rivers are threatened."
 forming_internal_confederacies: "Forming Internal Confederacies"
 forming_internal_confederacies_desc: "With the expansion of the Caddo population over time, it is only natural that certain division arise between families and communities.

 great_plains_trade_hub_desc: "The work we've done to cultivate a strong and unique Caddo society hasn't gone unnoticed.

 cheyenne_war_societies_desc: "The various warrios of the Cheyenne take up training within and learn from our war societies. It is these that help our people survive the harsh reality that is around us, and keeping them alive and strong is something that isn't just 'wanted', it is needed for our very survival."

 form_the_council_of_forty_four_desc: "Central to our governance is the Council of Forty-four. They take on administraitve matters for all Cheyenne people and is made up mainly peaceful chiefs, but as time goes on, they will encounter new matters that the Cheyenne people have never faced before. If we continue to slowly reform it and shape it into a more modern council of sorts, it can become a grand administrative structure that we revolve around."
 ruthless_expansion_against_enemies: "Ruthless Expansion"
 ruthless_expansion_against_enemies_desc: "We have beaten rivals back beyond the borders of the Cheyenne, but who is to say they are going to stay there? We must undertake efforts to spread our people and borders out, claiming new land that our rivals cannot claim as their own. We will see to it that they do not get the upper-hand against us in land or in military means, we must stay ahead."
 tales_of_what_is_to_come: "Tales of the Future"
 tales_of_what_is_to_come_desc: "There are some who are venerated as prophets or mystics in Cheyenne society. We take them very seriously and what they predict, and what they have come to us with recently is tales of new weaponry and technology just on the horizon, brought to us by people who will seek to strike us down at all points. We must these predicted technologies (when they come to us) and use them against our enemies and rivals, to help ensure the safety and survival of the Cheyenne people."
 hit_and_run_tactics: "Hit and Run!"
 hit_and_run_tactics_desc: "Of these new things brought to us from far away lands, the horse has been perhaps one of the most valuable. With it, our warriors have been able to travel much faster and hit much harder in combat, and by cultivating usage of tactics in conjunction with Cheyenne horsemen, we can ensure greater success in the future against our enemies."
 keep_the_sacred_arrows_and_the_sacred_buffallo_hat: "The Sacred Arrows; The Sacred Buffalo Hat"
 keep_the_sacred_arrows_and_the_sacred_buffallo_hat_desc: "With the Sacred Arrows symbolizing male power, and the Sacred Buffalo Hat symbolizing female power, they have been sacred to the Cheyenne people for generations now.

 influences_from_teotihuacan: "Influences from Teotihuacan"
 influences_from_teotihuacan_desc: "Our area and people have been here for centuries, like many others around us, and have seen a myriad of influences come upon them. One of the most notable of these has been from Teotihuacan, a city to our east that flourished some ages ago but has sense faded away. The influences from the city, however, lasted in our people, especially in our building methods and culture, both of which have flourished since the loss of Teotihuacan."
 toltec_memories: "Toltec Memories"
 toltec_memories_desc: "The Toltec Empire was perhaps one of the greatest forces we have ever seen in the region. Its influence spread across vast swaths of land, including ours to a degree, and though their empire may be gone from the maps of today, their memories still ring true in our people and court today. Influential families of Toltec descent are still around and if we cultivate our court properly, we can attract these families in due to time to serve at our court."
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco: "The Salt Fields of Tzacoalco"
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco_desc: "The salt from these fields are quite valuable to many people. It helps preserve food and adds flavor to almost any kind of cuisine, thus making it a valuable commodity. It would be in the best interest of the people of Colima if we refined our production methods and increased our output over time so that we incur more value over time."
 defending_against_the_purepechas: "Defending against the Purepechas"
 defending_against_the_purepechas_desc: "Rivals? Enemies? One in the same. The Purepechas to our east have long been ones to try to cut down the Colima state from its position, but we stand against them at all times. We must concentrate on how to defend and route their raiding attempts and vicious attacks so that we can properly develop and prepare an offensive strategy of our own as time goes on."
 chichimeca_guamar_threats: "The Threats from the North"
 chichimeca_guamar_threats_desc: "The wild ones to our north, the Chichamecans and Guamar, are undoubtedly threats to Colima and its people. The ancestors of those wild fiends are what brought down the great Toltec Empire and it is from that example that we must learn. Fielding a larger and more effective military is perhaps the most obvious and most effective solution that our people are resorting to and it is something that we should actively endorse to stave off not only these threats, but perhaps others as well."
 usage_of_obsidian: "Usage of Obsidian"
 usage_of_obsidian_desc: "Obsidian has long been in use by our people; generations upon generations have used it for both civilian and militaristic purposes. The tools developed with obsidian parts seem to work well and as a result, we are having an easier time developing the land to our liking."
 state_for_the_tecos_people: "A State for the Tecos People"
 state_for_the_tecos_people_desc: "The Tecos have previously not been united in every sense. Divides in communities would bubble up into being full-on feuds that would cause chaos in our lands, but we are transcending those times now. We must utilize what we have and what we have and will learn to cultivate a state for the Tecos people, for, if we do not, we may be lost to the sands of time like so many of our ancestral states have been."

 nagualism_in_our_religion: "Nagualism"
 nagualism_in_our_religion_desc: "Being an integral part of our religion, nagualism comes down to a baby being born with an ability to shapeshift beyond the normal human form and into an animal form of some sort. This can either be helpful or harmful to our society, depending on how our religious traditions develop, but we will do our best to steer them into a direction of tolerance and acceptance, with nagualism being integral to that acceptance."
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures: "Surrounding Cultural Influences"
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures_desc: "We have taken in influence from other cultures around, like the Maya, Mixtecs, Zapotecs, and Purepechas, leading us to be a sort of multi-cultural society that fuses several other elements into the central Tlapanec culture. It would be wise of us to reach out and accept those other cultures that once contributed to our own so that a more peaceful exchange of traditions and customs may take place in the future, rather than having cultural isolation take place."
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments: "Cotton Garments"
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments_desc: "They may be fanciful to some and useless to others, but we know just how useful they can be. From stopping arrows to stopping the blades of obsidian weapons, the armor we fashion from cotton is becoming more and more useful for the Tlapanec warriors, and bolstering production of cotton will help out our production revenue as well as stockpiles of cotton for later use."
 fighting_the_aztecs: "Fighting the Aztecs"
 fighting_the_aztecs_desc: "Time and time again the Aztec people invade our land for tribute and land. Though we drive them out time after time, they encroach further into our domain with each push. It is time we learn to fight them on equal terms and drill our warriors as they do, promoting warrios of merit and skill rather than warriors of noble blood alone. They will not stand to invade use anymore; we will resist the Aztecs."
 cultivate_larger_dominions: "Cultivate Larger Dominions"
 cultivate_larger_dominions_desc: "There are barely any large cities in our area; only villages to small towns of people, but still we maintain control over them with some ease. It would be in the best interest of the Tlapanec people if these villages and towns grew in size to become more powerful and prosperous cities, capable of giving us viable warriors and workers for all parts of society."
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec: "What is Rightfully Tlapanec"
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec_desc: "Tlapanec land is rugged and harsh, but not hopeless. There have been slow efforts to cultivate the land further beyond what it currently is, but the jungle and weather constantly hamper our endeavors to do so. If we can concentrate our workforce and advance our tool quality, perhaps we can make faster progress for all of the Tlapanec people."
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state: "An Integrated Tlapanec State"
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state_desc: "After growing and becoming what we are now, it's only right that we attempt to centralize authority and focus on internal matters so that our people are prosperous and not suffering from inabilities on our part. Educational measures are what is next for us, integrating educational reforms and places of learning all around the Tlapanec realm so that the commoner may learn what was once only available to the noble class."

 three_hearts_three_cities: "Tajin, Cempoala, and Teayo"
 three_hearts_three_cities_desc: "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Tajin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."
 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture: "Perfecting our Crafts"
 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture_desc: "We are known for our craft work in pottery, ceramins, sculptures, and architecture. There are several who marvel at the works of our cities and people and if we continue to steadily increase our production of said works and continue developing our unique styles, there is no doubt that the Totonacs will be a truly prestigious trading power in the region."
 ceremonial_centers: "Ceremonial Centers"
 ceremonial_centers_desc: "We have several centers where ceremonies, both religious and cultural, take place. The upkeep of them is tough at times, but the effort is well worth it due to the strengthening of our faith through them. Building more and refining our traditions done at these centers will do not only the commoners good, but our priestly class and noble class as well; we just simply need to ease them into these upcoming reforms."
 non_human_sacrifices: "Non-Human Sacrifices"
 non_human_sacrifices_desc: "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."
 preserving_totonac_culture: "Preserving Totonac Culture"
 preserving_totonac_culture_desc: "There are several who would see Totonac culture be absorbed into their own and these influences are spreading throughout Totonac society. We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."
 against_the_aztecs: "Against the Aztecs"
 against_the_aztecs_desc: "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."
 rebuilding_taijin: "Rebuilding Tajin"
 rebuilding_taijin_desc: "Burned down in a fire so long ago, but still within our memory. Tajin must not ever be forgotten and its place must be kept sacred within the hearts of the Totonac people. Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

 speakers_of_four_languages_desc: "Those of our homeland in the Toluca Valley speak four main languages: Otomi, Matlatzinca, Mazahua, and Nahuatl. Such diversity in how our people speak allows easier connections to be made with neighboring states, and if we incorporate more languages as we go on, we can be even more appealing to neighboring states later on."
 memories_of_the_tepanec_empire: "Memories of the Tepanec Empire"
 memories_of_the_tepanec_empire_desc: "In ages past, we were the subjects of the Tepanec Empire. They may not have lasted long, but the system of master-to-subject that they enforced was good groundwork for us to build off of. If we continue to cultivate it and reform it as time goes on, we can ensure a friendly and good relationship with our future subjects."
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs: "Fending off Foes"
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs_desc: "From two sides we are threatened: the Purepechas and the Aztecs. They both seek our land and people, but we would rather not be subjects to either if we can help it. We must resist them and strive to maintain our independent status; there must be a true state for the Matlatzinca people, not a petty subject state that is abused by overlords."
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions: "Fortify Toluca Valley"
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions_desc: "Toluca Valley is our home and has been for centuries now. The valley in it is clear for all to see and as such there are many who want it under their control. We must, as a result, fortify it and barricade it from invasions so as to ensure the prosperity and safety of the Matlatzinca people."
 tight_administrative_structure: "Tight Administrative Structure"
 tight_administrative_structure_desc: "Through the nature of how the Matlatzinca people live in the Toluca Valley, the administrative structure has to be close-knit and centralized. This may be strange to outsiders, but for us, it is natural and needed. A decentralized system will simply lead to the breakup of all Matlatzinca cities and what power they hold."
 develop_matlatzinco: "Develop Matlatzinco"
 develop_matlatzinco_desc: "Our core city, Matlatzinco, may not be as big as other cities around us, but it is what we call our capital and what we shall develop into a grand place for the Matlatzinca people. From here, we shall enjoy greatness and prosperity."
 city_states_to_nationhood: "Toward being a Nation"
 city_states_to_nationhood_desc: "Matlatzinca people may not seem like they are ready to become a fully fledged nation to some, but the people themselves know differently.

 shadow_of_the_aztecs_desc: "The core of the Aztecs is found in Tenochtitlan and the Triple Alliance that was formed between it, Texcoco, and Talcopan. The influence from those three cities stretches far and wide, even to the lands of Coixtlahuaca, thus making us in their shadow partially. It is not all dark for us, however, as we can and have been learning from them for sevreal decades now. Let us put this knowledge into practice and unite our people beyond their previous ties, like the Aztecs in the north have."
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica: "Multiple Cultures"
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica_desc: "There are two prominent cultures found within Coixtlahuaca: the Choncho and the Mixtec. Gradually this will change and we will grow to encompass more cultures within the borders of our state and when we do, we must be accepting of them as we have been with the Choncho and Mixtec so far. Cultural cooperation is not simply good for us, it is needed if we wish to survive to become larger and stronger."
 plain_of_snakes: "'Plain of Snakes'"
 plain_of_snakes_desc: "Our name translates to 'plain of snakes' and whilst to some this might be ambiguous, it is quite obvious to us: the land is rife with snakes! Harmful ones at that! Whilst not every part of our land is snake-filled, we can at least use the naturally harsh landscape to our advantage, cultivating natural defensive barriers against invaders (some of which may include snakes)."
 aztec_attributes: "Aztec Attributes"
 aztec_attributes_desc: "We have inherited various traits and traditions from the Aztecs over the decades and with them have come ceremonial customs that have become integrated with our own. Part of them emphasize hierarchy in society and the positions of 'Cuauhtlatoani', 'Tlatoani', and 'Huehuetlatoani', amongst others. By keeping certain legitimizing rituals together and within Coixtlahuaca, we can keep our royal family and leader in power with the utmost loyalty from our people."
 mixtec_connections: "Mixtec Connections"
 mixtec_connections_desc: "The Mixtec are known for their stone crafts as well as architectural style and are also integral to Coixtlahuaca. If we can utilize their craft work for our own projects, we'll see better and more refined buildings rise up in our land, as well as ones that are just nicer to look at in general."
 nahuatl_language_prominence: "The Nahuatl Language"
 nahuatl_language_prominence_desc: "The main language within our court is Nahuatl and its the same for several courts near to Coixtlahuaca, as it should be. As time goes on, we will promote and refine the language as we see fit to help our efforts in both our administration, military, and diplomatic sector. It'll be a unifying force within Coixtlahuaca."

 blending_together_into_coixtlahuaca_desc: "There will be some who doubt just how effectively we can integrate different cultures and people into our state, and to those who doubt us, we say, 'watch, and learn'.

Let others around us know this, and let them know that our status beneath the gods is holier than theirs; none shall be above us in this regard."
 makers_of_dyes: "Makers of Dyes"
 makers_of_dyes_desc: "Traditionally we produce good quantities of dyes for ourselves and surrounding places. It is a rather rare commodity and as such it's valued throughout several places around us; bolstering and spreading its production out will only serve to increase the sale of these dyes that we produce, and we will profit from this in time."

 at_the_foot_of_the_mountain_desc: "In Zapotec, our name is Xaguixe, meaning 'at the foot of the mountain'.

Building upon it and making more intricate and sturdier fortifications will allow us to fend off any incoming invasions or intrusions into our domain."
 celestial_constellation: "'Celestial Constellation'"
 celestial_constellation_desc: "Our original name, 'Xaquija' means 'celestial constellation' and with it, a god came from the heavens in the form of a bird, accompanied by a constellation of stars and founded a temple here. From here, and with the mythical foundation of the large stone split in half with the name of the Stone of the Sun, we claim even greater religious authority, but this time branching into the Zapotec area of things. Even with this, the Zapotec and Aztec mythologies are becoming interconnected as time goes on and as such, our religious authority is becoming even stronger, stronger than any of those around us."
 aztec_fighting_spirit: "Aztec Fighting Spirit"
 aztec_fighting_spirit_desc: "The Aztecs did not impart merely religious traditions upon us, but also military traditions. The fighting spirit and warrior ranks of their society is something that we need and promote greatly, and with them in mind, our warriors will become more capable in battle."

 zapotec_influences_desc: "The Zapotec people are widespread in our communities, similar to the Aztecs.

 nahuatl_bastion_desc: "The Nahuatl pantheon and language, and even the great Nahua culture must be kept alive and sacred.

 remember_eight_dear_jaguar_claw_desc: "He was the very first Mixtec ruler to ever unify the disparate Mixtec city-states, and under him, the Mixtecs thrived like never before. We must claim the legitimacy that he put forth and never let it go, for, in order to survive in the region we live in, we must be united in our efforts from the ground up."
 three_traditional_mixtec_groups: "Three Traditional Mixtec Groups"
 three_traditional_mixtec_groups_desc: "The three groups within Mixtec society that divide the us into a sort of societal hierarchy has been around for several generations now and it has served us well in keeping things in order, despite our spread out communities.

 foremost_goldsmiths_desc: "People from all around the region know just who to go to if they want work in gold done, and done right: the Mixtecs.

 resistant_mixtec_city_states_desc: "The Mixtec people are necessarily united on all matters. There is an extensive history of division between the various city-states that are inhabited by Mixtecs, but this division does not mean lack of resistance. Indeed several are able to take up arms against invaders and it is this military tradition from the past that we remember well from them."

 reform_the_mixtec_codices_desc: "For so many years now, the codices we've crafted have been used by several different people groups for various different things, from educational to cultural purposes. In time, however, we will need to refine how we make and craft them as they are sometimes disorganized and without a clear direction in them. By refining them, we can better spread education and ideas throughout Mixtec society."

 ahuacatlan_lordship_desc: "Though the kingdom they established was not memorable to some, we of Xalisco remember it fondly.

 present_and_incoming_religious_traditions_desc: "Xalisco is home to a myriad of religious traditions, stretching from centuries ago to from neighboring areas and regions.

They would much rather cooperate with fellow Gonds than outside people who might persecute them, thus giving us the opportunity to invite outside Gondi clans into our domain to share their knowledge with us."
 gondi_hinduism: "Hinduism of the Adivasi People"
 gondi_hinduism_desc: "The Hinduism practiced by the various Adivasi people (of which Gonds are one) is varied and mixed with animist practices as well as other unique practices that are found only within select communities. With this in mind, there is an inherent need to be open-minded and tolerant to other faiths around us since within our own domain, we can see as much variety as there is outside of it."
 natural_terrain_knowledge: "Natural Terrain Knowledge"
 natural_terrain_knowledge_desc: "The varied terrain of Chandrapur is such that we have needed to learn how to deal with flooding, heat, tropical conditions, shifting heights in the terrain, and more. Using this knowledge we have elsewhere is going to be vital in the defense of Chadrapur as we can field defensive measures when and where we absolutely need them, and with a sort of home-field advantage thanks to our knowledge of the terrain."
 chiefs_into_kings_into_emperors: "Chiefs into Kings into Emperors"
 chiefs_into_kings_into_emperors_desc: "Our ambitions are great, and our will is not yet broken, but the road ahead is still long and treacherous. As we build up our court and power, we are going to be fighting for almost every point of power we need and with this fighting comes valuable experience for our military. What we learn in the past will serve to help us fight on in the future."
 using_this_so_called_coal: "Coal?"
 using_this_so_called_coal_desc: "This... Black material that we are able to mine and use as a resource for a variety of things... It's qualities are slowly becoming apparent to the people of Chandrapur and if we continue to use it properly, refine it over time as we mine it out of the ground, and perhaps even export it as a commodity, the people of Chandrapur could become even more powerful than they already are."

 mythical_kings: "Mythical Kings"
 mythical_kings_desc: "The list of kings within Ramnagar Fort is illustrious and stretches back for several centuries, but, if we are to be realistic with things, many of these kings are simply the stuff of myths and legends. Still, they serve as glorious tales to be catalogued and told to our people throughout the land and to future generations."
 institute_garhs: "Institute Garhs"
 institute_garhs_desc: "Garhs are a way of organizing fortification management and upkeep around the land and it involves the use of various clans that we rule over. If we make this system more formal and integrate it fully with our administration, we can expand our defensive positions as well as keep state maintenance in order so that we can focus on other matters."
 gond_clan_organization: "Gond Clan Organization"
 gond_clan_organization_desc: "The way Gond clans are organized can be confusing to some, especially those outside of the subcontinent, but it is not impossible to learn nor is it impossible to formalize. Our interest lies in formalizing their structure and position inside our realm so that they do not grow too powerful nor do they feel disenfranchised; it's a tough balancing act, but it's one we must commit to if we are to be successful in this world."
 malvi_authorities: "Malvi Authorities"
 malvi_authorities_desc: "The authority from the Sultanate of Malwa is overbearing at times, but it does bring with it benefits that we would not otherwise get to see. One of these benefits is the introduction of firearms to the state of Garha, and in seeing how useful they've been for the Malvi people, using it for ourselves could make things all the more easier when fighting other powers around. Perhaps, in time, we could even turn these firearms on those who introduced us to them."
 consolidate_the_lands_of_gondwana: "Consolidate Gondwana"
 consolidate_the_lands_of_gondwana_desc: "Our central focus is on the region known as Gondwana, home of the Gondi people. Garha, as well as other polities, have strived to unite this region isn't very well defined as the spread of the Gond people is so far reaching, but we can say for sure that Central India is key to Gondwana itself, and if we can obtain and maintain control over it, we will be able to work with cohesively with our fellow Gonds to develop the Gondwana into a thing of beauty."

 rajput_caste_heritage_desc: "Back before the times of Bahmanis and during the times of when the Delhi Sultanate was a grand force on the subcontinent, Khandesh was ruled by the Chauhans, who claim kinship with the Rajput people. The military prowess found within the Rajputs was also found within the Chauhans and we benefit from this still, taking up the warrior tradition and military fighting heritage imbued within the people of our land."
 rebels_against_bahmanis: "Rebels Against Bahmanis"
 rebels_against_bahmanis_desc: "Our foundation as a separate entity in the region comes from when the governor of Daulatabad, Bahram Khan Mazindarani, rose up against the Bahmani ruler along with Malik Raja and powers from Berar and Baglana. Though the rebellion failed, it set in motion what would allow Malik Raja to separate Khandesh away from Bahmanis and other powers into a completely independent state, and, though this would change inevitably later on, it helped set a precedent for our people in the future."
 land_of_the_khans: "'Land of the Khans'"
 land_of_the_khans_desc: "Known as the 'land of the khans', there will need to be a land to match the power and ferocity of the previous great khans we know from stories and books. Khandesh may not be the most likely state to succeed where other khans and khan-like figures have failed, but we can always strive for it and part of that includes building up a strong and formidable military force."
 from_caliph_umar_al_faruq: "Lineage to Caliph Umar"
 from_caliph_umar_al_faruq_desc: "Malik Raja claimed his lineage dating back to Caliph Umar from the Rashidun Caliphate. Such a bold and grand claim will be hard to maintain at times, but we are intent on making it be seen as legitimate and true, for we can indeed be the successors to the caliphate and emulate Caliph Umar and project the strength that he once did during the times of old."
 rivals_of_gujarat: "Rivals of Gujarat"
 rivals_of_gujarat_desc: "The rulers of Gujarat have put us under their authority time and time again, seeing our land as valuable for only themselves. We have tried to break away at various points, but still the Gujarat power wielded to our west is strong. We must strike when they are weak, take up arms and march forth when we are at our peak, and seek out victory against those who once subjugated us, and those in the future who would see the Khandeshi people subdued!"
 fortify_the_holdings_of_khandesh: "Fortify Khandeshi Holdings"
 fortify_the_holdings_of_khandesh_desc: "Fortifications in our land are routinely being challenged by new siege tactics and weaponry, necessitating better defensive measures and a more efficient way of running the garrisons within. By continually compounding upon our successful renovations from before, the fortifications we hold close to us will serve as great barriers to the enemies of Khandesh."
 satiate_the_minorities: "Satiate the Minorities"
 satiate_the_minorities_desc: "Like many other sultanates before Khandesh, the minorities of Hindustan are plentiful, seeking both recognition and local power when they are conquered (that is, if they do not revolt or have their revolts suppressed). Being as traditional sultanates are, we seek to work with and accept these minority groups rather than to alienate them, thus bringing Khandesh into a greater state of ease and promoting better social cohesion."

 what_may_have_been_vijayapura_and_po_ni_desc: "The history from before we became part of the wider Muslim world is murky and unclear, but we do have some indication that there were states existing before us, such as Vijayapura and Po-ni. These smaller states were subjects of at times Srivijaya, Chinese powers, or Majapahit, but all contributed to the culmination of a greater Bruneian identity as time went on. Even today, we still feel the effects of these past states in our own court, and for this influence we are thankful."

 lessons_from_srivijaya_and_majapahit_desc: "Undoubtedly we have influences from Srivijaya and Majapahit. Both were once great giants on the stage of the Nusantara Archipelago and have since declined greatly from their golden ages, but their influence on us is unmistakable. We will incorporate what we have learned from both powers into our own state and we can surely be the next great empire of these wondrous islands of culture, religion, and trade."
 chinese_influences: "Chinese Influences"
 chinese_influences_desc: "The Chinese, dating all the way back to the Song Dynasty, have had great amounts of influence in their own waters to the north, but also to the waters in the south, where we call home. Our submission to them as a tributary status some time ago helped influence part of culture, and even though we no longer pay tribute to the Chinese, we still do earn ourselves a good name with powers around us from this healthy relationship we've cultivated with them."
 trading_in_nusantara: "Trading amongst the Islands"
 trading_in_nusantara_desc: "The various islands of Nusantara are rich in both culture and religion, but also in resources to cultivate. The resources cultivated and traded off are the life-blood of empires and kingdoms and sultanates in the archipelago and we are no exception. It would be in our best interest to partake in this trading tradition and invest time and effort into making sure trade goes in our favor, as opposed to our rivals."
 promote_thalassocratic_control: "Promote Thalassocratic Control"
 promote_thalassocratic_control_desc: "The nature of our region of islands is such that, mere land armies are not enough. Naval superiority is absolutely key to ensuring dominance in both peaceful times and times of war and we of Brunei know this all too well. It is our duty, then, to ensure ourselves a large and great navy to promote our own control over these water ways, and to disallow our rivals from gaining the high ground on this matter."
 cross_island_empire: "Multi-Island Empire"
 cross_island_empire_desc: "Like those before us, we reach out and touch several islands with our power in order to properly assert control over the territories inherently valuable to Nusantara. It won't be easy to do, but the Bruneian administration is ready to enforce laws and regulations in more localized areas that our nation reaches out toward; when all is said and done, unification will be a reality we can achieve, and one that Brunei will attain for itself."

That is our the coming golden age for our people, and not only is it a glorious sight to behold when it arrives, but it will be a milestone for us where upon we expand further than ever and set our ambitions beyond our home island of Borneo and those others nearby. The world is vast and in need of authority that can make the land and people profitable and prosperous, and it is those of Brunei who know how to make this happen."

Beware the harsh north..."

 revitalize_the_legacy_of_the_althing_desc: "There vestiges of the althing in Iceland still, what with it being established in the early 900s and continuing on from there and then going into a decline once Christianity was introduced into Iceland. Still, it is an important part of Icelandic history and one of the oldest parliaments in the world; using its legacy and perhaps even revitalizing it in the coming years could bring legitimacy and stability to the land once more."
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism: "Geographic Isolation and Opportunism"
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism_desc: "Isolation is something very familiar to Icelanders. But, what our ancestors knew that some people today forget is that Iceland is close to the lands of what is called Greenland, and our old sagas do tell of our ancestors travelling to here and beyond. We can use our isolation in geography, then, as an advantage and begin efforts to expand our domain outward through colonization efforts that are more organized and more effective than the ones our ancestors put forth."
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade: "Promote Icelandic Commerce"
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade_desc: "Yes, commerce from Iceland is remote and hard to reach, but it is worth the travel for some people, such as those from Ireland, Scotland, Norway, and other northern-oriented nations. If we can entice more consumers to come north and engage with the Icelandic merchants more than in previous ages, then we will see profits over time (along with more visitors... It gets lonely here in Iceland)."
 effects_of_the_reformation: "Effects of the Reformation"
 effects_of_the_reformation_desc: "Europe has apparently been home to religious strife of a different kind that is unfamiliar to the people of Iceland. These so called Protestants and Reformed folks are springing up all over Europe and, well, Icelanders are curious as to what will come of themselves now that they too are feeling the effects of the Reformation. Whatever path is chosen for Iceland, the notion of serving the people and promoting stability no matter what will be our primary goal."
 use_our_naval_legacy: "Our Naval Legacy"
 use_our_naval_legacy_desc: "What we lack in terms of a formal army we make up for in the form of a fearsome navy. By continuing to build it up and refine our naval practices, there will be few who can put up a genuine fight against our naval dominance. After the waters are secure, we can then focus on our efforts on land."
 norse_resurgence: "Norse Resurgence"
 norse_resurgence_desc: "The Norse may have changed a lot since the days of the Vikings and their dominance over the northern shores and waters, but those of Iceland can still recall their memories clearly compared to the likes of Norway, Denmark, or Sweden. With this legacy, the Norse will rise again as they expand out, they will once more engage in bloody wars of raiding and conquest.

 former_fuedatory_of_delhi: "Former Feudatory of Delhi"
 former_fuedatory_of_delhi_desc: "The memories of when we were a feuadtory underneath the likes of the Delhi Sultanate are not forgotten in the slightest; much of our administration is still somewhat based on what the sultanate introduced to our people, meaning we take after certain laws and measures from the ground up. One essential part that we have put work into integrating into Gwalior is the effective tax system they left behind, meaning we are able to obtain much higher revenues from the people of our land than other states around us."
 rebels_against_delhi: "Rebels Against Delhi"
 rebels_against_delhi_desc: "The earliest record of us rebelling against the likes of Delhi are in 1391-1392 under our leader of the time, Virasimha, but this was met with defeat by the general Islam Khan. Still, Virashimha was not executed and he worked tirelessly to undermine Delhi's efforts to integrate and keep hold of Gwalior, to which he obtained success some years later. As we well know, there are plenty of others who rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate, and many of those revolting nations would likely be our friends later on."

 jain_scholars_in_gwalior_desc: "Virama, who ruled Gwalior from 1402-1423, had an immense amount of Jain scholars come through and set up residence inside of Gwalior and with them saw the rise in new ideas being spread about. If we continue to allow Jains into Gwalior and seek out a mutualistic relationship with them, the prosperity of the state could increase by so much more than we think."

 between_delhi_and_malwa_desc: "With the decline of the Delhi Sultanate came other sultanates in its place, one of the most prominent ones being to our south: the Sultanate of Malwa. Both the remains of Delhi and Malwa to our south pose great threats to the likes of Gwalior and its people, so it would be beneficial to learn better military strategies from both powers when possible whilst also preparing for any invasion either power might try for."
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others: "Asylum to Dissidents"
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others_desc: "With the downfall of Delhi comes dissidents who wish to use there skills against their former overlord, or perhaps some other power in the region. Though many states will reject said dissidents, why should Gwalior? We revolted from Delhi, we should be a practical haven for these kinds of people! And we can make good use of them and obtain connections, both shady and formal, with powers around the subcontinent and perhaps even beyond."
 improving_defensive_measures: "Improving Defenses in Gwalior"
 improving_defensive_measures_desc: "The central fortress, Gwalior Fort, is key to our power, certainly, but there is more to us than that central fort. With a defensive mentality in mind, we must prepare a more stringent and effective defense in our homeland so that any invaders will suffer even more when coming through. Partisan attacks, strange explosives buried in the ground that explode with enough pressure, and traps at various points, all can be employed by Gwalior to help thwart foreign invasions."
 rajput_diplomacy: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 rajput_diplomacy_desc: "Connections with the Rajput people are strong within Gwalior. We are not full Rajputs ourselves, but we have taken after several traditions and customs that the Rajputs themselves have, including around diplomacy. Though we have refined it over the years, this sort of Rajput diplomacy for the people of Gwalior is flexible and our policies are more fluid than in other states around us so that we can adapt to changing circumstances, whatever they may be."

 rao_underneath_the_sisodias_desc: "Our ruler, when underneath the leaders of Mewar, take on the title of Rao (a different form of Raja). With this in mind, we are designated more toward maintaining the lands that Mewar cannot govern themselves and thus must learn to field more military regiments in a more refined manner, thus keeping this land under lock-and-key and safely producing revenue."
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe: "Legacy of the Meena Tribe"
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe_desc: "Before the time of the Rajput invasion of this land, there was the Meena tribe who stayed here, claiming descent all the way back toward the Matsya Kingdom. Though most are gone from power now in Hadoti, some still remain as prominent members of Hadoti society and their legacy of having more respect for women than more traditional Hindu states is felt throughout all of Hadoti, especially in our own court."
 rajput_meena_intermingling: "Rajput-Meena Intermingling"
 rajput_meena_intermingling_desc: "The two groups may have fought each other to a bloody end in the previous centuries, but that time is over now. We must work on reconciling these differences within Hadoti itself and also work on enjoining these two populations into one cohesive unit that Hadoti can rely on, for, times of war and times of disaster do not discriminate based on tribal or clan membership, they take from and stike at anyone and everyone."

 handing_down_of_martial_traditions_desc: "Our connections with Mewar have been strong in the past, and as a result of this strong connection with them there has been a mutual exchange of knowledge between Hadoti and its overlord. The martial training and traditions from the Rajput heartland are plentiful and the military of Hadoti is ever thankful that they are included in the sharing these traditions."
 dynastic_support_from_mewar: "Dynastic Support"
 dynastic_support_from_mewar_desc: "When push came to shove in the past for Hadoti, the royals of Mewar could be relied on for backing up our claims or our side in a dispute. We can still use this leverage today or perhaps even rely on our own connections not in the royals of Mewar to bolster our own dynasty, especially on the international stage."
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans: "Cultivation of Rajput Clans"
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans_desc: "The plentiful clans of Rajput people are ready to serve Hadoti, they simply need to be organized and given strong leadership from us. Our own efforts to institute viable candidates for leadership are going well so far and the beneficial relationship between the Hadoti government and the clans is infact helping things progress, so we should expect the Rajput powerbase within us expand and be ready for future conflicts."
 taking_after_the_sisodias: "Taking after the Sisodias"
 taking_after_the_sisodias_desc: "The Sisodias of Mewar were unique in several ways, one of which was in how illustrious they were and how they tried to make themselves out to be above other Rajput clans through poetry and other art forms. Perhaps it is time that those of Hadoti do the same? We could separate ourselves from the other clans, rise above them, and promote the royalty of Hadoti as the grand and true leaders, above all others... It sounds nice, doesn't it?"

 rajput_and_malvi_influences_desc: "We are at the confluence of both Rajput communities and incoming Malvi influences from the east. Both hold great sway in Baglana and both at times create friction when they meet each other, but when combined properly, they create a militaristic nature that is unlike anything around us. Baglana can only benefit from such a combination of forces."
 the_fake_subject_state: "The Fake Subject"
 the_fake_subject_state_desc: "Previous invaders have come through our land and subjugated a few chiefs and simply thought that the entirety of Baglana was underneath them, but they were greatly mistaken. Tribute to be paid? Irregular at best. Troops to be levied? Maybe, maybe not. Baglana has always been a tenuous, or rather, fake subject state and it will continue to be so, inspiring our people to strive for freedom from these incursions against us."
 our_natural_terrain: "Our Natural Terrain"
 our_natural_terrain_desc: "The terrain of Baglana is not forgiving to those who are new to it. Mountains and valleys and fertile plains all scattered about in Baglana, and we know how to best use them in a defensive strategy as well as navigate them for troop movements. Others who might invade us know very little of these routes we take and as such we will take advantage of this."

 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates_desc: "With how scattered some of our cities and communities are, it should come as no surprise that those of Baglana have shady connections all around, especially with raiders and pirates. The western coast has been a haven for us in this regard and we are willing to make these contracts with pirates and raiders into something more formal so that all of Baglana can benefit."
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja: "Rein in the Chiefs of Baglana"
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja_desc: "The myriad of chiefs throughout Baglana are capable of causing issues at times with the central government, and the Raja is not always able to calm them down through peaceful means. There must be expeditions sent out to formally subjugate and bring these chiefs underneath the flag of Baglana so that they do not stir up trouble beneath the Raja or in the communities that are loyal to the Raja."

 rivals_in_khandesh_desc: "Khandesh has been a staunch rival of ours for decades now, being one to launch attacks against us and the Gujarati people to our northwest. They think they can easily come through Baglana and tear down what we've worked on for so long, but they couldn't be more wrong. The people of Baglana are ready and willing to take up arms at every point against these invaders and Khandesh will be the first to know this."
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana: "Reshaping the Military of Baglana"
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana_desc: "By now we have noticed the faults in the army of Baglana, one of which is the fact that payment and service is not nearly as formal as it should be. If we can organize military matters into something centralized and cohesive, we'll benefit from a better quality army that can do more work than a simple levy-based army of irregularly trained soldiers."

 the_prices_of_being_on_the_border_desc: "The border region in which we inhabit has been crossed by a great many people before the sultans of Multan came around. We are accustom to this occasional passing of people and have even been successful in garnering some of these people to settle in the lands of Multan. With an influx of population, they will be good to use as soldiers when Multan needs them since warfare is inherent to our position... After we integrate them into society, of course."
 great_center_of_trade: "Great Center of Trade"
 great_center_of_trade_desc: "Past travellers have written about Multan and what they write is nothing short of the truth: that Multan is a grand center of trade along the Indus River. We readily embrace this fact and try to stimulate trade as best we can so that our revenue streams can increase as time goes on."
 friends_of_the_baloch: "Friends of the Baloch"
 friends_of_the_baloch_desc: "Few talk of the people of the Baloch for some reason or another; perhaps it is because they are seen as tribal and unworthy? We don't know for sure, but what we do know is that our citizens have made great friends in the people of the Baloch and many mercenary contracts are coming through to Multan from the region because of this. Why not cement this friendship further and accept the mercenaries into our fold?"

 repulse_delhi_and_afghan_invasions_desc: "Pashtun and Hindustani troops alike are keen on taking over Multan at all times, whether by diplomacy or by conquest, neither of which we will readily allow happen. The armies of Multan must resist foreign incursion and fight to preserve what was once a divided land that is now united as one!"

They are no longer a frontier land that is simply on the edge of an empire or kingdom of some sort, no, they are now a heartland to a vibrant and prosperous people. We must let none take this away from the Multani people, making this land once again a mere frontier domain."

 malla_kings_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our lineage of rulers are known as the 'Malla Kings' and their lineage stretches all the way back toward a little before the 8th century. Such a long and strong line of succession makes Bishnupur ingrained in the people it rules over; the people have faith in the royal lineage and know it well enough to have a good amount of trust in the ones who have ruled over Mallabhum for so long."

 the_isolation_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our homeland is quite isolated from other communities and states and rarely do people come through our lands to invade or even trade. This isolation isn't completely bad for Bishnupur since it has allowed us to cultivate a grand defensive mentality and structure that few can match."

 praying_to_bipodtarini_devi_desc: "Our kings are often associated with Bipodtarini Devi, who is considered one of the 108 avatars of the goddess Durga. She is closely linked with the concept of overcoming troubles and often prayed to for this, and thus as our kings are associated with this, they too should be looked up to in order to help overcome struggles, thus in part promoting the relation with Bipodtarini Devi."

 abiding_by_the_mallabda_calendar_desc: "We have developed a unique calendar in Bishnupur that is unlike most others (though somewhat related to other Bengali calendars).

 centralization_efforts: "Centralization Efforts"
 centralization_efforts_desc: "It isn't enough to have chiefs ruling over the various lands we control and paying lip-service to us they want to. We must centralize the administration and put our foot down where we can so that Warsangali is not subject to the whims of tribal leaders."
 somali_horn_of_africa: "The Horn of Africa"
 somali_horn_of_africa_desc: "Our position on the Horn of Africa allows us to establish a great amount of diplomatic connections as well as improve our sailing capability (similar to the other Somali states on the coast). Let us not waste this opportunity in the slightest, for Warsangali will be in need of these diplomatic ties sooner or later."
 extending_warsangali_trade_relations: "Warsangali Trade Relations"
 extending_warsangali_trade_relations_desc: "Rekindling our old trading ties from around the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the coasts of East Africa and in the Persian Gulf are key to keeping Warsangali competitive in terms of trade. Who knows, once we rekindly this coonnections, perhaps we'll profit more than we did before."
 tension_in_the_west: "Tensions in the West"
 tension_in_the_west_desc: "The western corridor for us is rife with tensions, what with the Adal Sultanate fighting the Ethiopians in a bloody and drawn out feud. We must prepare ourselves to take advantage of the fallout from this ongoing conflict, for if we conduct ourselves properly in both the daylight and the shadows, none will be able to stop us from taking what they leave behind and more."
 questions_in_the_north: "Questions in the North"
 questions_in_the_north_desc: "The northern coasts of Arabia have always been in question to us of Warsangali. There are powers there that could help us in both military aspects and trading aspects, but there are also several powers to choose from. Whoever we do end up choosing, let us make sure we are able to make good friends with them in a quick fashion."
 the_threats_down_south: "The Threats Down South"
 the_threats_down_south_desc: "Our fellow Somali people are not united and are often found split into various mercantile states in the Horn of Africa and along the East African Coast. How we deal with them is going to be a subject of great debate within our administration due to the fact that there are multiple ways we can extend our influence. Which of them shall we choose?"

 modernizing_trade_networks_desc: "The paths of trade we rely on heavily are often unsafe and full of unpaved dirt paths.

 robust_infrastructure_developments: "Infrastructure Developments"
 robust_infrastructure_developments_desc: "We know just how important infrastructure is and how vital things like sanitation, education, and housing are to the regular citizens of Majeerteen. By investing in these projects more over time, we can and will see our people prosper and our state expand steadily as it profits in the long-run from our hard work."
 reaching_out_for_trade_agreements: "Reaching out for Trade"
 reaching_out_for_trade_agreements_desc: "Like many before us, being on the coast of Africa means that we need to reach out across the open water to obtain friendship as well as profitable trade agreements.

 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen: "Naval Efforts of Majeerteen"
 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen_desc: "We would not be a true Somali Sultanate if we did not bolster our naval force to some degree. The time has finally come to invest in our sailors and ships so that they do not falter when on the high seas when trading or when in combat against rival navies."
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen: "Centralized Authority in Majeerteen"
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen_desc: "By reforming the authority within Majeerteen over time and putting an emphasis on bureaucracy over tribal politics, we will see a less unrest within the sultanate as well as increased influence in local politics. We'd rather have ourselves influencing the people of Majeerteen as opposed to possible insurgents hidden within the local chiefs."
 establish_a_modern_sultanate: "Establish a Modern Sultanate"
 establish_a_modern_sultanate_desc: "With changing times comes changing technologies and ways of thought.

 establish_the_majeerteen_military: "Establish the Majeerteen Military"
 establish_the_majeerteen_military_desc: "The military of Majeerteen has never been anything that stands out in comparison to other Somali states, but we know this cannot last. Naval warfare is important, but taking land that is away from the coast is also very important and a strong military will be needed for that. Let us take the first steps in establishing a centralized and cogent military force that Majeerteen can use for both offensive and defensive purposes."

 memory_of_the_mongol_invasions_desc: "Within the memory of Nagaur is that of the Mongol invasions and what they did to the political as well as military landscape of the subcontinent.

 alliances_against_mewar: "Alliances against Mewar"
 alliances_against_mewar_desc: "Mewar has been something of a thorn in our side, but also a beneficial power to Nagaur at other times. The Rajputs are not to be underestimated at all, but we must also remember that they too will want to take over us.

 against_the_sayyids_of_delhi_desc: "The rulers of Delhi have often sought to influence and take control over Nagaur in some way or form since we are partially of Islamic origin, but their efforts shall forever be in vain.

 fortify_naguar_fort_and_others_desc: "It is no secret that our land is need of defenses, but as to how and where we will build these defenses is another question.

 enemies_in_the_huron_iroquois_desc: "Traditionals enemies as they may be, the Huron and Iroquois have a powerful influence on the lands around us. We must keep our knowledge of warfare we have engaged in against both powers close to us so that we do not lose our grasp on militancy or our warrior spirit. They may seek to strike us because we are smaller than them, but they will know just how strong we can be in the heat of battle."
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs: "War and Civil Chiefs"
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs_desc: "There is a distinction between what chiefs handle war-time affairs and peace-time affairs.

 steady_expansion_of_lands: "Steady Expansion of Lands"
 steady_expansion_of_lands_desc: "We take some lessons from the Huron and Iroquois in military traditions, but we must also look at how they have handled a growing population and various growing communities, and then look at how we are handling our own.

 improving_fighting_styles: "Improving our Fighting Style"
 improving_fighting_styles_desc: "With new ages come new ways of fighting and Meskwaki and Sauk people know this for a fact.

 population_upswing_desc: "Do we not take to the new ages well? Our progress seems to say we do, what with our growing population and expanding communities, we are at a place we could never have dreamed about just a few generations ago.

How it is handled may have been more complex in the past, but people want change and refinement of the system of succession.

 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi: "Turbulent Past of Kalahandi"
 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi_desc: "Kalahandi itself has been through a great amount of power shifts between rulers and those who adhere close by to the ruler. The dynamics of these shifts aren't always clear, but the military is always involved in some form. By ensuring that the military is at least curtailed and not capable of seizing all power in Kalahandi, but is actually integrated properly within the state itself, we can organize it in a much better fashion."
 rising_power_of_the_nagas: "Rising Power of the Nagas"
 rising_power_of_the_nagas_desc: "The nagas should never be underestimated. The nagas survived the ancient extermination attempt by Janamejaya, the Kuru king from so long ago, and now they are resurgent today.

 adoption_of_new_strategies_from_orissa_desc: "We are entering new times that bring with them interesting new ways of fighting.

 solidify_kalahandi_desc: "On the larger scale of things, Kalahandi is still a disorganized entity with decentralized power being rife throughout, not unlike the history of the land in prior centuries. It might not be easy to do, but attempting to centralize power and to uphold the authority of Kalahandi over chiefs and local leaders may do us more good than we currently anticipate."

Once a great site for trade and agriculture, now it has fallen into disrepair, but there is hope still that it can come back and become like it use to be. The practices we used to build up Old Kaskaskia Village we will never forget as we trudge on into the future."

 the_cahokia_tribe_desc: "What the Cahokia brought with them to the confederation were 5 chiefs that helped in matters of governance, something that is very much needed when presiding over such a large amount of people groups. By keeping them as they were and slowly evolving the positions they are in, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for ourselves."
 the_peiora_tribe: "The Peiora Tribe"
 the_peiora_tribe_desc: "The Peiora tribe is one that united with several others and brought a sense of unity to the confederacy.

 legacy_of_the_13_tribes_desc: "The 13 tribes in total that we encompass within the confederacy will need room to expand in time. Let us go forth an prepare these lands for them to settle in, for they will sow seeds of prosperity and reap the rewards for the wider confederation later on. The other people outside our borders, they cannot do as we do in this sense; they will only spoil the land."
 the_tamaroa_tribe: "The Tamaroa Tribe"
 the_tamaroa_tribe_desc: "The Tamaroa tribe has worked to fight off other neighboring tribes time and time again, and their work inspires the warriors of the confederacy. They will be integral to the survival of our confederacy and we should not take them for granted, for, if we cannot fight our enemies properly, we will become their subjects in time."
 assimilating_other_tribes: "Assimilating Others"
 assimilating_other_tribes_desc: "By now we have become masters at assimilating other groups of people into our greater confederacy. It should not be a surprise that we can continue to attract these people into our fold and integrate them without much of a hassle, it's simply part of being the Illinois Confederacy."
 the_illinois_confederacy: "The Illinois Confederacy"
 the_illinois_confederacy_desc: "Formalizing the entrance into the Illinois Confederacy is what our main focus is currently. Whether by conquest or by peaceful annexation, we will need to make sure that people are welcomed warmly into our fold and that they are accepted for who they are.

 link_to_the_telugus_desc: "Though some would dispute this claim, we assert that our founder was actually the brother of the last ruler of the Kakatiya Dynasty (Prataparudra, reign: 1289-1323). We can use this connection to one of the great Telugu dynasties south of us to better enhance our connections around us and in time, build up our successive dynasty like the Kakatiya Dynasty itself."
 keep_bastar_unified: "Keep Bastar Unified"
 keep_bastar_unified_desc: "There is subtle trouble that brews beneath the surface of Bastar, that being the question of succession upon the death of our ruler. Some would prop up a different son or daughter from the chosen heir and attempt to split off from Bastar, but we will take measures to ensure that this does not happen. Central authority will be paramount within our borders and within our court."

 succeed_the_kakatiya_dynasty_desc: "Their kingdom died out due to the invasions of the Delhi Sultanate, but we live on after them as a successor state if sorts.

For too long they have been tied down by petty political matters and tribal feuds that get in the way of good governance in conjunction with good leadership in military matters.

 feudatory_mandala_traditions_desc: "With how political matters go in and around Ratanpur, feudatories and mandalas are of no issue to us. Having more of them and having them be loyal to us is a sign of greatness, prestige, and power to many and by ensuring that ours (whether they be governed by family or not) are not rebellious, we can propagate our influence outward."

 defend_the_land_of_ratnapura_desc: "What we've built up over the decades must never be given to the enemy, not without the fiercest of fights we can give.

 garjati_fortress_control: "Fortress Control"
 garjati_fortress_control_desc: "The lands of the Garjati people are filled with scattered fortifications that are often under the control of semi-independent tribal chiefs. Subjugating them formally and reining them into the central authority of our state will ensure that we can maintain more forts for less cost, and in time, build up a better model for maintaining fortifications overall."
 garjati_adaptive_warfare: "Adaptive Warfare"
 garjati_adaptive_warfare_desc: "The tropical climate of the Garjati homes are not home to the most stable fighting grounds. Often there are uneven hills, sudden ridges, dense jungles, and uncultivated areas that make warfare much more small-scale and scattered. By adapting our strategy to not only this terrain, but whatever terrain we find ourselves on, we can make the fight for enemies even worse and the fight for us even more advantageous."
 the_meaning_of_gajapati: "The Meaning of 'Gajapati'"
 the_meaning_of_gajapati_desc: "In Odia, Gajapati means 'king with an army of elephants'.

 enforcing_authority_in_patna: "Enforcing Authority in Patna"
 enforcing_authority_in_patna_desc: "The authority within Patna can sometimes be weak and without much force behind it due to networks of communication being relatively slow.

 cultivation_of_keonjhar: "Cultivation of Keonjhar"
 cultivation_of_keonjhar_desc: "There is a need for us to build up the central structure of Keonjhar beyond just a petty village.

Our ruler, the raja, needs to become smart and skillful in all areas of life, but he also needs to be strong in his will to have an up-right and astute court backing him, otherwise he has no power.

 confluence_of_past_powers_desc: "There are several past powers that have held the land of Jeypore as their own, or have strived to make it so, which has resulted in several lasting effects in terms of architecture and value. We would be fools to not use this to our advantage."
 coming_together_of_various_traditions: "Various Outside Traditions"
 coming_together_of_various_traditions_desc: "Just as past powers came for Jeypore, various cultures left their mark too and even today we experience a vast amount of varied cultural influence. It would be wise of us to begin accepting these cultures into our administration instead of alienating them entirely since we cannot stop them from coming into and out of our land."
 reform_the_dynastic_succession: "Reforming the Succession"
 reform_the_dynastic_succession_desc: "To us the way of succession in Jeypore is often messy and chaotic and often times it leads to issues regarding power and money. We must take to reforming the system entirely, revising laws that affect succession both politically and with regards to the royal family itself."
 plentiful_mercenary_contracts: "Plentiful Mercenary Contracts"
 plentiful_mercenary_contracts_desc: "With the acceptance of various cultures comes the arrival of various warriors for hire. There are plenty to go around and we shouldn't be so quick to turn them away, especially when we haven't formalized parts of our own military yet; they could be more useful than we initially think."

 social_cohesion_in_jeypore_desc: "With so many different cultures and traditions floating about Jeypore, there is going to be a need to mediate disputes and feuds between certain groups.

 succeeding_the_patna_state_desc: "The decline of the Patna state may be seen as inevitable to some, but for us, it is a somber story that comes to a close.

 taming_the_garjat_states: "Taming of the Garjat States"
 taming_the_garjat_states_desc: "Picking up where our ancestors in Patna left off, it is our duty to stabilize the inner areas of Odisha and to put down the ambitions of petty chiefs and local rulers.

 devotion_to_samleswari: "Devotion to Samleswari"
 devotion_to_samleswari_desc: "The local people of Sambalpur hail Samleswari as their central deity and we've come to grow fond of the deity as well.

 learning_from_managing_rival_berber_groups_desc: "North Africa is home to several Berber groups and tribes, some of which are greatly hostile to each other and any form of authority that stretches over them.

 marinid_hafsid_and_crusade_enemies_desc: "The Marinids, Hafsids, and Iberians are our three principle enemies.

Tlemcen shall not fall, not to the likes of our age-old rivals!"
 corsair_bases: "Corsair Bases"
 corsair_bases_desc: "As with any good North African state, we too use the likes of corsairs to our advantage. By keeping their bases on our coastline protected and relatively free from administrative encroachment, we'll see some of the profits they earn and also get ourselves a start on the seafaring tradition."
 promote_cultural_unity_of_tlemcen: "Promote Cultural Unity"
 promote_cultural_unity_of_tlemcen_desc: "There is a key thing missing in Tlemcen that will be the breaking point of us if we are not careful: cultural unity. If we do not have unity in language and tradition, or at least acceptance of foreign languages and traditions, we will fall apart from the inside out. It is our duty to ensure this does not happen at any cost."
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries: "Relying on Ourselves"
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries_desc: "Mercenaries are nice at times for when we absolutely are in need of them, but too often we find them more costly than they are worth and wavering in their loyalty toward us. We'd do better to start relying on our own power to field proper armies rather than the fickle fealty of roaming mercenary bands."

 reinvigorate_bhati_rajputs_desc: "For too long we have been put down by other rajput clans and take advantage of by neighboring powers.

 keeping_caravan_routes_safe: "Keeping Caravan Routes Safe"
 keeping_caravan_routes_safe_desc: "One of the key parts of Jaisalmer and its fortress is the path of caravans that are used by both merchants and civilians alike.

We must work to keep them safe and profitable, for the well being of Jaisalmer."

 jauhar_desc: "This seemingly horrid act is a form self-immolation by Hindu women in particular in order avoid capture, enslavement, and other atrocities that could be committed by hostile forces seeking them out in the midst of certain defeat (that is, defeat on the side of the Hindu women). This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history. It is not a beautiful act, but it is one that signifies prestige amongst the various Hindu states; we will not be conquered nor subjugated so easily by these foreign invaders."
 raiding_hostile_trade: "Raiding Hostile Trade"
 raiding_hostile_trade_desc: "In times of war or when trade relations have severely broken down between us and our rivals, there is no harm in making their trade sector suffer somewhat.

 anti_siege_attacks: "Anti-Siege Attacks"
 anti_siege_attacks_desc: "We have since our inception been forced to learn the ways of siege warfare and it isn't easy in the slightest. What we have learned, however, is that sorties and anti-siege attacks from within and from outside fortifications can be extremely useful and it's something we of Jaisalmer should perfect. How and where can we practice? Jaisalmer Fort is a prime target."
 resurgence_of_the_bhati_rajputs: "Resurgence of Bhati Rajputs"
 resurgence_of_the_bhati_rajputs_desc: "The time has now come to proclaim a new age for the rajput people. The Bhati Rajputs are no longer the weak subgroup of rajputs as they had been before, but rather they are now one of the top clans around and ready to take up the mantle as leader of Rajasthan.

 willing_to_negotiate: "Willing to Negotiate"
 willing_to_negotiate_desc: "Our precarious position at our inception has made us of Jangladesh wary of what exactly our neighbors may against us should relations possibly break down. In order to take preventative measures against such things from happening, we must be willing and open to negotiations will nearly all parties both large and small, internally and externally. If we are willing to come to the table at least and speak about matters, rather than discard certain people or parties outright, we can show ourselves to be a cut above the rest."
 rajput_conflicts: "Rajput Conflicts"
 rajput_conflicts_desc: "The rajput are rarely ever truly united on a single cause. Clans will disagree greatly on one matter or another and it's only when there is a common enemy for all rajputs that we have seen unity amongst all clans. As such, we must take advantage of this rajput infighting and see if Jangladesh can proclaim itself more than what it seems to be on the surface."
 construction_of_fortifications: "Fortify Jangladesh"
 construction_of_fortifications_desc: "Much like other rajput states, we of Jangladesh are going to need to build fortifications and protective barriers against foreign invaders.

Whether or not we can navigate the fog that is the future is unknown, but what we do know is that we cannot and will not forsake our rajput heritage, but we will also not forsake the coming about of new technologies.

 the_threat_of_bengal_desc: "The Muslim invasions of the 1000s and to 1200s were some of the most frightening times for the traditional Hindu and Jain states of Northern India. The Sultanate centered in Bengal is so far our nearest and most apparent threat and they've made it clear to us that they seek to conquer us. Let us, the people of the Koch Kingdom, stand firm against these threats and with our Hindu brothers and sisters in oppose the Muslims like other states have before in India."

 bhuyan_chiefs_as_allies_desc: "In times of turmoil, the rough and informal yet effective network of Bhuyan Chiefs that lay scattered in the region have come to our aid against the likes of the Bengal Sultanate.

 settle_the_turbulent_times_after_the_pala_desc: "When the last great Buddhist power in India faded, this being the Pala Empire centered in the Bengal region, the turmoil left behind was rife in every area possible.

 asserting_authority_over_the_bhuyan_chiefs: "Bhuyan Chiefs as Enemies"
 asserting_authority_over_the_bhuyan_chiefs_desc: "The Bhuyan Chiefs are not always our friends, like some Koch people think.

 utilize_fertility_of_the_land_desc: "The land of Koch is much like the land of the Bengal Sultanate: fertile and sometimes rife with flooding.

Still, people make a living out here and have raised up powerful kingdoms in the past, some of which were larger and smaller than us.

 brahmin_influences_desc: "The influences of Hinduism are obvious to many people in Kachar. There are several parts of Kachar that are not quite completely Hindu, but still we feel the presence of brahmins and others that are present within more traditional Hindu society.

 specialize_the_sephongs_tribes_desc: "These clans within Kachar serve traditional roles in society and have come to specialize in certain areas of labor and work for the wider society of Kachar.

 build_up_the_mel_mandap_desc: "The Mel mandap is the council hall where representatives and other officials meet in order to flesh out the legislation and administration of Kachar.

 legacy_of_the_rajputs_desc: "Rajput clans used to span great areas across the subcontinent some centuries ago, but that time has come and gone now. The legacy they left behind is still alive, though, in the fact that some rajput clans and states remain in opposition to those who would see them destroyed for their wealth and glory; Bundelkhand is one of them, and must hold these rajput traditions in high esteem just as it does the land in which is lives on."

 northern_strikes_against_us_desc: "The Northern Gangetic Plain is fertile and rife with population growth, along with state growth that we must be watching.

Let us show them that we will be able to resist such invasions and thwart their attempts at subjugation."
 capital_fortress_town_orchha: "Capital Fortress Town"
 capital_fortress_town_orchha_desc: "To have an open capital ripe for invasion is foolish, is it not?

 evolve_pawnee_warfare: "Evolving Warfare"
 evolve_pawnee_warfare_desc: "There isn't a simple way in which we can go about surviving in this new age of warfare, administration, and diplomacy.

 promote_the_oodham_language_desc: "Our language (called O'odham) is a distinct characteristic of our people and would mature if we were to promote it universally throughout our realm instead of having it be intermixed with other languages.

 resource_competition: "Resources Competition"
 resource_competition_desc: "The vast plains are valuable for the amount of wild game that can be hunted but not only this, fertile land by rivers is also valuable to a great many people for the resources produced.

This is what will set us apart and make us better than our rivals."

 recover_from_disasters_desc: "When a fire destroys parts of our villages and towns, or storms ruin crops for our people, we need to be sure that the central government of the Susquehannock Confederacy can handle these disasters and not have rampant decentralization occur when these events happen.

The Mikretcho Council is the one with the final say on many things and the king may not veto this decision; the Mikretcho Council also decides who is next in line as the heir to the throne, signifying just how important they are to the power structure of Ennarea."
 gold_and_slave_trade: "Gold and Slave Trade"
 gold_and_slave_trade_desc: "Traditionally we have been great traders of gold and slaves for a variety of political entities in the region and we are known exactly for this by many. We would be wise to use the diplomatic influence to our advantage whenever we can, but as time goes on, we may find that gold makes people talk as opposed to slaves."
 keep_the_divine_kingship: "Keep the Divine Kingship"
 keep_the_divine_kingship_desc: "To preserve the tradition of Ennarea is also to preserve the divine kingship. Without it, we would be set adrift in a sea of religious chaos and political turmoil, easy pickings for our hungry neighbors. Though we may reform the kingship in some manner or form later on, the root of it all shall always remain the same."
 reforming_tribal_polities: "Reforming Tribal Polities"
 reforming_tribal_polities_desc: "Tribal influences are far and wide throughout Ennarea and sometimes these tribal influences are more detrimental than beneficial. Attempting to centralize and reform these tribes into something more cohesive and manageable is what we will need in the future and it is exactly what we will get."
 charting_an_independent_path: "An Independent Path"
 charting_an_independent_path_desc: "We need not look to the might of Ethiopia for guidance when Ennarea's prosperity grows by the day, the week, the month, and the year. Strengthening our internal ties and connections, building roads, establishing infrastructure, and securing our own economic aspect is what will allow Ennarea to chart its own path that is not dictated by the likes of some foreign occupier."

 confluence_of_faiths: "At the Confluence of Faiths"
 confluence_of_faiths_desc: "Lebanon stands at the forefront of two major religions and is close in proximity to Jerusalem, making it a valuable target to secure for religious and political reasons. Thusly, we have been endowed with the likes of Judaism at times, Islam at others, and Christianity at yet more times. All three religions and many others have contributed to making Lebanon and its people what it is today."
 maronites_druze_and_islam: "Religions of the Land"
 maronites_druze_and_islam_desc: "The fact that we encompass large populations of both fully recognized religions and some non-recognized religions (such as the Druze) makes us a highly intriguing political target. We need to make sure that we use this intrigue well so that we can exploit it for our own benefit, rather than fall victim to those around us."
 levantine_maritime_contact: "Levantine Maritime Wealth"
 levantine_maritime_contact_desc: "The lands of Lebanon are coastal by nature and are the ancestral land of the ancient traders that were the Phoenicians. Like them, we can and will make ourselves trade giants and we will influence the nations of the Mediterranean by way of the flow of money and trade."
 caliphate_influences: "Influences from the Caliphates"
 caliphate_influences_desc: "There are unmistakable marks in Lebanon left behind by the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates. Though we are not completely Islamic, the Islamic legacy our home region has is both prestigious and valuable to many people across different regions such as Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and North Africa. Keeping the legacy of the Caliphates alive, whether it is in maintaining mosques or old palaces or other structures, will ensure that we are valued by more than just our own people."
 methodic_religious_governance: "Methodic Religious Governance"
 methodic_religious_governance_desc: "To govern such a diverse population of people is no easy task and the Lebanese administration has indeed had its struggles trying to sort out how the religions and cultures should and shouldn't interact. By focusing efforts on this matter in the future and trying to decipher better ways of governing our people, we can look forward to a tolerant and united future."
 lebanese_identity: "Lebanese Identity"
 lebanese_identity_desc: "After such a long time of being under the authority of other powers, the Lebanese people are finally coming into their own being. They are realizing now that there is a common sense of family between the Lebanese people and that other powers around them will only seek to smite them down."
 lebanese_trade_potential: "Lebanese Potential"
 lebanese_trade_potential_desc: "As time goes on, Lebanon is one to become a trade hub, a diplomatic hub, and a grand nation the likes of which few could dream of. Conquest is but a mere side show for us, for the pride we take in maintaining ourselves and our own peace is what we truly value."

 break_down_of_ajuran_desc: "As the power of Ajuran continues to decline, we must be ready to fight for our rightful place amongst other Somali clans and states. Drilling our troops and enforcing higher standards within our military will be needed if plan on sustaining our position of authority."
 the_geledi_clan_ascendant: "The Geledi Clan"
 the_geledi_clan_ascendant_desc: "A grand source of our power is the Geledi clan itself. No matter if they hold the office of power or not, they hold a great amount of influence within our state and supply both legitimacy, societal cohesion, and a sort of regal presence throughout. We will need all of this if we hope to succeed in the future."
 core_at_the_jubba_and_sheblle: "Core at the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers"
 core_at_the_jubba_and_sheblle_desc: "The core rivers which we call part of our heartland are the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers and they are invaluable for many areas in what is traditionally seen as Somali land south of the direct tip of the Horn of Africa. Monopolizing access over these rives like our predecessors did will allow us to profit greatly from trade."
 command_the_arms_trade: "Command of the Arms Trade"
 command_the_arms_trade_desc: "Firearms are valuable to a great many people throughout East Africa and we are no exception. Our strategic position allows us to take a commanding influence in the arms trade and as we do, our military will be able to more effectively field these advanced weapons rather than our outdated traditional arms."
 connect_with_muslim_dynasties: "Connecting with Other Dynasties"
 connect_with_muslim_dynasties_desc: "There are several other Muslim dynasties around us and as our predecessors have done, we would be wise to make diplomatic ties with them where and when possible. Rivals will be abound, but we should not make enemies of every nation around and state around us."
 designated_structure_for_war: "Structured Way for War"
 designated_structure_for_war_desc: "The way we conduct war is more structured than surrounding states. The Geledi clan has imbued us with a sense of structure in our leadership during times of war and we will conduct ourselves with a strict council of officers and generals."
 jihad_in_east_africa: "Jihad!"
 jihad_in_east_africa_desc: "As we come into contact with more and more Christians who see us as beneath them, our leadership is becoming more and more inclined to declare holy wars against them so as to preserve our way of life and our way of worship. They say their faith leads them to conquer lands around us, we say our faith leads us against their ambitions."

 connections_along_east_africa: "Connections Along East Africa"
 connections_along_east_africa_desc: "East Africa is filled with many trade cities that seek to earn profit and establish good relations with a variety of people and Malindi is no exception. Thankfully we already have a good set of connections along the coast and we can capitalize on this diplomatic foundation in the future when we need to make more relations elsewhere."
 swahili_buildings: "Swahili Buildings"
 swahili_buildings_desc: "There are a great many buildings of Swahili design and style here. There are so many that our builders and laborers have become well versed in constructing them in a timely fashion since Malindi is a prospering and growing city. This skill is going to become more and more useful as time goes on for us since the city expansions will make room for new buildings."
 trade_in_ivory_and_horns: "Trading in Ivory and Horns"
 trade_in_ivory_and_horns_desc: "What Malindi is known for is trading, particularly in the fields of ivory and rhino horns. Ensuring that we are the dominant forces in these respective markets will ensure that Malindi's economic sector is never at stake, and from here we can slowly expand this hold into other resources as well."
 welcoming_of_foreigners: "Welcoming of Foreigners"
 welcoming_of_foreigners_desc: "Foreign people should never be turned away from Malindi if they seek to do no harm! We should welcome them into our land and attempt to establish ties with them instead, who knows what they could offer us and what we could offer them in exchange. Mutualistic relationships are much better than hostile relationships, for hostility often brings strain to trade."
 maritime_rivalries: "Maritime Rivalries"
 maritime_rivalries_desc: "Peace is good and valuable, but Malindi and its people cannot deny that rivalries occur and fighting breaks out amongst the states of East Africa. Most warfare is decided out at sea, however, since most of the profitable trade that people fight over flows via oceanic trade routes, so we'd be wise to ensure that our sailors and admirals are well versed in naval warfare both at range and up close."
 inland_connections: "Assimilate Inland"
 inland_connections_desc: "We don't have serious connections inland but we do have some. These ties are greatly valued by those of Malindi since they (as well as foreign traders and families who stay in Malindi permanently) are sources of fighters and sailors, both of which we need to survive and thrive."

 become_the_heart_of_the_region_desc: "It can be said there are many hearts to East Africa, from Mombasa to Malindi to Zanzibar to Mogadishu and even to Sofala, but there must be one to rule them all. Malindi shall be that single entity that rises above the rest and the one that becomes the central beating heart to East Africa, but to attain this status will require action both on the high seas and on the rugged coasts."

 aksumite_heritage_desc: "The history of Shewa as an area of significance goes back several centuries, even back to the times of the Aksumite Empire. Let us never forget what has come before us in the form of states that have come and gone, tales of great people who travelled to and from Shewa, and prestigious people who have settled in Shewa. Their legacy is what we must cultivate as we continue on in the very same place as they were once at."
 ifat_sultanate_ties: "Ties to the Ifat Sultanate"
 ifat_sultanate_ties_desc: "Before our time, there was the Ifat Sultanate that rose to prominence in the east and expanded westward toward Shewa. Often times they would clash with the likes of Christians and this would bring about great battles the likes of which previous states had not seen. The Ifat Sultanate may be gone now, but their legacy of having a fighting spirit against their religious enemies is still imbued within the people of Shewa today."
 history_of_religious_conflict: "History of Religious Conflict"
 history_of_religious_conflict_desc: "Islam and Christianity in this region mix like water and oil, and in the realm of politics, react with flowers of fire and destruction. The people of Shewa are no stranger to this and despite their defensive position in the highlands, still experience the troubles of religious conflict. We must not hide our face from it, no, we must charge at it head-on without fear of death or defeat!"

 memory_of_the_makhzumi_dynasty_desc: "There once was an independent Muslim Shewa Sultanate, back from around the 900s to upon the conquests westward by the Ifat Sultanate in the 1200s. Though the dynasty from that era, the Makhzumi, is no longer around, it's legacy lives on today in the people of our land. They strive for greatness and they uphold the dynasty properly, just as the dynasty in exchange upholds the people of Shewa."
 tensions_with_the_oromo: "Tensions with the Oromo"
 tensions_with_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo are more than a small issue, they are a contentious ethnic group that often seek to migrate and settle in places that are already inhabited by others, especially Amhara people akin to our own. We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."
 defense_over_offense: "Defense over Offense"
 defense_over_offense_desc: "The inherent position of Shewa makes defensive strategies more viable and conquest of the land harder. At times the people here have been isolated from the rest of the region and at other times they have been connected somewhat, but the fact remains that defensive placements and a defensive mentality are key to the survival of Shewa."
 religious_deliberation: "Religious Deliberation"
 religious_deliberation_desc: "Navigating the waters of religious tension in the region Shewa finds itself in is no easy matters. Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state. Regardless of the dangers, we must be ready to consider carefully the actions we take in the future regarding religion in Shewa, and how we will go about enforcing a state-sponsored religion."

 catholic_orthodox_tensions: "Catholic-Orthodox Tensions"
 catholic_orthodox_tensions_desc: "Between the bastions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity that are in the Russian region and the stalwart Western Christians that are in Scandinavia, Karelians have been caught in between these two religious authorities for ages now. Though we may not find true solace in siding with one or the other, we can at least attempt to mitigate the tension within our own land and promote a common unity between Karelian people despite the differences of faith."
 fief_at_viborg: "The Fief at Viborg"
 fief_at_viborg_desc: "There has been a fiefdom of sorts at Viborg for quite some time and it has done good things for Karelians of the land. Though it was distant from strong central authority due to its location, it did help maintain authority in the area and it helped build up fortifications and a military presence in the region. Why disregard the methods for maintain and develop the land of such a place like Karelia if they come from a power that formally held authority over us? We simply should not; we should be using these methods to make sure Karelia can become more than just a snowy paradise of sorts that lacks actual infrastructure."
 traditions_from_the_days_of_fiefdom: "Traditions from the Fiefdom"
 traditions_from_the_days_of_fiefdom_desc: "The fiefdomn days not only helped maintain the land, but it also helped maintain a solid and continous flow of tax revenue to a central authority, something that has been hard to do in a region such as Karelia. By conforming this taxation method to the Karelian government and also learning how the fiefdom conducted defensive measures, we will be much better suited to grow as a state."
 margrave_traditions: "Margrave Traditions"
 margrave_traditions_desc: "The commanders of Viborg Castle itself were margraves in function and practice. Taking into account how they worked for the Swedish crown and how they managed the land in terms of military forces, we can begin to cultivate a sustainable and cogent Karelian military force."
 build_up_the_defensive_positions: "Defensive Positioning"
 build_up_the_defensive_positions_desc: "Strengthening the defenses of Karelia will only serve to make us harder to invade and few people would even venture to our heartland to even visit us, let alone invade us. Let us make sure this sentiment is echoed throughout the years by fortifying ourselves with stronger walls, greater garrisons, and more competent defensive strategies."
 promote_independent_identity: "Promote an Independent Identity"
 promote_independent_identity_desc: "We are neither Russian nor Swedish, but something else altogether. Since before the 11th century we have been around, influencing matters in both Sweden and Novgorod and elsewhere in neighboring regions and throughout this all, from our highest point to our lowest point, we have maintained ourselves as different. We shall always continue to do so as time goes on, no matter the cost."
 keepers_of_the_icy_north: "Keepers of the Icy North"
 keepers_of_the_icy_north_desc: "Let them come forth to the iced over and snow packed northern regions, the hostile forces that seek to destroy shall suffer in agony all along the way while the Karelian soldiers and civilians await, perfectly capable of withstanding the climate and weather. The only people that can really rival our nature in this regard are the Finnish, the Sami, and maybe the Siberian people. The Russians can claim to best us, but we all know that the Karelians are better adapted to the cold than they are."

 golden_horde_remnant_desc: "We were once so great, so illustrious, so powerful... But now, we are a shadow, a husk, a mere withering frame of our former self. We must not lose heart nor hope in this dire time, we must be prepared to reinstate what influence we had around us. Those who broke away from us must know that our banners are not yet buried and that our desire for greatness has not been put out. The Great Horde will rise once again!"

 hostilities_on_all_sides_desc: "From Nogay to Kazan, and from Azov to Moskva, we are surrounded by hostile powers who seek to dismantle the last great remaining vestige of the Golden Horde. Our officers and generals must not lose heart at the sight of these hostile powers, but rather they must be emboldened to retake what was once ours. Through innovative tactics and strategies, we will take back what was once ours."
 the_status_of_sarai: "The Status of Sarai"
 the_status_of_sarai_desc: "Sarai holds the core traditions of the Golden Horde. Though its status and prosperity may have dwindled since the 1300s, it still remains a strong status symbol in the region and must remain so for the future. Renovating it and building it back up will only increase our legitimate claims to the lands we once held as our own."
 reinstate_golden_horde_influence: "Reinstate Golden Horde Influence"
 reinstate_golden_horde_influence_desc: "The khanates that separated away from us remember our influence and how the Golden Horde ruled over the land, such memories cannot be erased. The tribes and people will remember our authority and submit with ease compared to some pretender power coming through and attempting to claim legitimacy in the wake of the Golden Horde."
 modernize_horde_weaponry: "Modernize our Weapons"
 modernize_horde_weaponry_desc: "The traditional weapons of our ancestors are increasingly becoming ineffective against the likes of our neighbors to the west and south. Gunpowder weapons are what will carry forth combat in the future and the steppe people must adapt to this soon if they wish to live to see the coming years."
 reinstating_subject_tributaries: "Reinstate Tributaries"
 reinstating_subject_tributaries_desc: "The tributary states that the Golden Horde called their own were unruly at times, but they kept the system of tribute flowing and helped the Golden Horde prosper. We should reinstate this system of tributaries but also be ready to reform it as time goes on so that we do not end up with break-away states near our border."
 stable_politics: "Stable Politics"
 stable_politics_desc: "If there was one central issue that sapped the health of the Golden Horde, it was breaks in the political system. Assassinations, usurpations, corrupt officials, and bribed generals, they all contributed to our downfall from before and led us directly to where we are now as the Great Horde. Through concrete reformation efforts though, we can formalize the government institutions and offices and ensure that our political situation is less prone to breaking down."

We still are facing trouble here in the north, but our troops are more than willing fight in their homeland and for a righteous cause, especially when it is for reuniting the old domain."
 reunite_the_yuan_lands: "Reunite the Old Lands"
 reunite_the_yuan_lands_desc: "Once, our lands stretched from the steppe homelands of the north to down south toward the jungles of Dai Viet, but now we are fighting for survival back where our ancestors started at. It will not be easy in the slightest, but our once grand empire must come about again and we must reunite what we once lost."
 rebuild_karakorum: "Rebuild Karakorum"
 rebuild_karakorum_desc: "Karakorum was sacked and destroyed in 1388 by the Ming Dynasty, leading to a decline in legitimacy and power for all of the remaining Yuan Dynasty. If we ever hope to bring about real legitimacy to the Yuan Dynasty again, Karakorum would be a great place to start that isn't related to conquest since it can be a foundational element to regaining our legitimacy in the eyes of the people and the eyes of the military."
 adapting_gunpowder_usage: "Adapting Gunpowder Usage"
 adapting_gunpowder_usage_desc: "Gunpowder usage is semi-regular throughout the ranks of our soldiers, but the persistence of traditional methods of fighting are hindering us more and more as we head into the future. We must adapt gunpowder weapons completely, integrating them into the military of the Yuan Dynasty so that we can better hold our own in conflicts."
 ancestral_claims: "Ancestral Claims"
 ancestral_claims_desc: "Those who see our resurgence will undoubtedly know that it is a legitimate power reclaiming the lands it once lost. The Oirat and other Mongol tribes may protest our actions, but the senior officials and families throughout know exactly where we come from and where our ancestral claims come from."
 chinese_administrative_measures: "Chinese Administrative Measures"
 chinese_administrative_measures_desc: "We have taken some of the administrative ways of the Chinese and used them for our own purposes, but learning and then integrating the techniques used took quite a while for our people to fully implement.

 recovery_from_the_mongol_invasion_desc: "In the midst of the 1300s, as the once great Mongol Empire was split up and the successor states were tearing themselves apart, Bukhara was still feeling the ravages of what the Mongols did to the city. We must never forget how these scars on our heart came to be, but we must also not let them bind us into the past; we must recover and become a prosperous center of culture, art, learning, and trade for all of Central Asia just as we once were."
 intellect_center_of_the_islamic_world: "Old Intellectual Center"
 intellect_center_of_the_islamic_world_desc: "After the fall of the Sogdians and with the rise of influential Caliphates in the south, Bukhara experiences a golden age of sorts under the Samanids. During the time of the Samanids, Bukhara's people may have still worshipped idols at times along with others following Islam, but their work at building Bukhara up made it into an intellectual center of the Islamic world. If we are to truly succeed our past, we must meet this legacy and transcend it with our work in all facets of the state, whether it be in religion, in politics, or in society itself."
 improve_public_education: "Improve Public Education"
 improve_public_education_desc: "Steppe life did not readily allow for us to educate the populace like we would want. We have seen what kind of marvels settled life can bring and what achievements in thought and innovation the public can bring about if they are educated enough; indeed much of the Persian heartland and its history is an example of this and we would do well to follow this example and begin large efforts to improve the education of the Bukharan populace."
 settling_from_the_steppe: "Settling from the Steppe"
 settling_from_the_steppe_desc: "In no way is it easy to go from nomadic and semi-nomadic steppe life to settled life; the culture of the people changes and so to does the politics that stem from them. We are not without experience in this matter, however, as we have been attempting to handle this matter for decades now and will continue to do so as time goes on. There is no panacea to this drastic change in life styles for thousands upon thousands of people, but our administrative efforts can certainly attempt to help them out."
 utilizing_fire_and_shock: "Fire and Shock"
 utilizing_fire_and_shock_desc: "If there is one thing that Bukhara will need for its survival, it is a strong military sector. Protecting the archives and scholars and attracting more requires safe passage and safe cities, no? Therefore we must not stay stagnant in our ways of the past with largely cavalry-based armies that use shock tactics primarily. We should be looking to modernize and adapt our weapons so that we can compete with other states around us, but also we must recognize that our traditional fighting style still does offer advantages in certain situations. Much like how Bukhara is a merging of cultures and traditions, it can be the sight of merging fighting styles."
 persian_cannoneer_experience: "Persian Cannoneers"
 persian_cannoneer_experience_desc: "The Persian people, though at times hostile to us and at other times friendly to us, are skilled in their usage of new weapons, especially the larger caliber ones that are found in sieges and extensive military engagements. We have reports that they have frequently used them against the Turks of the west in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, so perhaps hiring and recruiting Persian soldiers who specialize in cannons can do us good."
 patronize_learning_and_arts: "Patronize Scholars and Artists"
 patronize_learning_and_arts_desc: "Much like our old self, Bukhara is blossoming into a place of artistic brilliance and scholarly wonder. From madrasahs to mosques to temples to palatial estates, we have a myriad of places that are attracting great people from not only the Islamic world, but also other places too. From poets to physicians to traders and more, Bukhara is once again becoming a source of life and light for the entirety of Central Asia."

 ostyak_and_sibirian_land: "Ostyak and Siberian Land"
 ostyak_and_sibirian_land_desc: "The land of the Ostyak and Siberian people is harsh, cold, and undeveloped when compared to the southern lands. Our home villages in these lands  hidden away whilst our enemies seek it out when they invade, and whilst they roam around, they will feel the cold touch of winter bind them into an icy grave."
 islam_and_shamanism: "Islam and Shamanism"
 islam_and_shamanism_desc: "We are by far the northern-most political entity in which Islam is the dominant religion, but we must realize that indigenous Shamanist beliefs of the northern people are prominent within our domain. We must not be so readily discriminatory toward them as that will only bring about instability to the entire realm; rather, we should be tolernat and understanding to them, slowly coercing them to being one with Islam over time."
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties: "Interconnected Dynasties"
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties_desc: "Throughout the many lands that the once might Mongol Empire conquered, the descendants are now split into several different but still related dynasties. Even we in the far north are connected to this web of dynastic descendants and it is because of this that we can easily enforce our authority over the lands we conquer throughout the steppe and beyond."
 forest_fighting_methods: "Forest Fighting Methods"
 forest_fighting_methods_desc: "The nature of fighting in the far north has made us change our tactics somewhat from how the steppe hordes would normally do combat. Because of the dense forests of the far north, we are more adept at breaking huge cavalry charges and breaking down general shock tactics that some would be used to."

 cogent_relations_with_the_mirzas_desc: "The nobles of our land, the Mirzas, are needed to maintain control over the wide open land. Though we don't have sprawling urban settlements, we do have sizeable settlements that require local authorities to enforce control over them so that we can maintain unity and stability throughout."

 assimilation_of_siberians_desc: "They aren't seen as the most capable fighters, but we know we can outfit them with the equipment they need. Siberians come into and out of our land regularly and sometimes look for work, who says we can't pay them to fight for us when we need them most?"

 home_of_islam_mecca_medina_desc: "From the time of Muhammad in the mid-600s to now, Mecca and Medina have been the religious centers by which Muslims travel to and pray to. Its custody and protection and ownership remains a large subject in several circles in our own nation as it gives us both prestige and reputation amongst other Islamic nations. On top of this, the firm control over the two sites gives us a degree of religious authority, attracting a number of Islamic scholars and imams of which some wish to spread the message of Islam to other lands. Who are we to hold them back from doing so?"
 legacy_of_islamic_conquest: "Legacy of Islamic Conquest"
 legacy_of_islamic_conquest_desc: "The great Caliphates of the past may be stuck in the archives we built, destroyed by various causes that led to a fracturing in the Islamic world at varying points, but their legacy lives on through us. Islamic conquest carried out by them is not lost on us and we are set on reviving it. Already there are soldiers of ours who deem in an honor to conquer in the name of Islam, yet restraint must be maintained with even the most zealous of soldiers in our service. Conquest must not mean brutal population treatment, but rather working with them and working to bring them into the wider Islamic world."

 succeed_the_caliphates_desc: "Where our predecessors once stood, others took their place and divided the spoils they left behind. This must be rectified by a true successor Caliphate that can maintain not only political authority, but religious authority as well. The system of succession must be refined and the court of ours must have strict order within it so that we do not fall prey to the various court schemes that plagued our ancestors."

 arabian_trade_connections_desc: "For centuries, Arabian merchants travelled along the coasts of the Indian Ocean to far away lands, sharing and gathering information along the way whilst also spreading the word of Islam to new communities along the way. Though spreading the word of the prophet is certainly needed, we must not forget these trade connections in the slightest. The revenue they can bring for us if utilized well enough is not insignificant and by connectiing with the scattered trade-based Islamic communities that have sprouted up throughout the centuries, we will be able to extract greater amounts of revenue yet."
 refine_and_transcend_clan_loyalties: "The Notion of Clan Loyalties"
 refine_and_transcend_clan_loyalties_desc: "Tribes and clans of the Arabian Peninsula are numerous and scattered, but they hold significant sway in deciding local matters from places such as San'a, Muscat, Jabal Shammar, and many more. We must communicate clearly with them, establish good relations with the tribes and clans, and ensure that they are loyal to the higher authorities of the land. If we can do this properly, then several local matters in villages and cities will be of little worry compared to if we were actively fighting said tribes and clans."
 protect_the_pilgramages: "Protect the Hajj"
 protect_the_pilgramages_desc: "The Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and it is what helps make Mecca and Medina such prosperous locations despite where they are situated. Our devotion to protecting and upholding the Hajj for all Muslim has led to many recognizing us as good custodians of the holy cities and a true leader in the Islamic world. It would be in our best interest to uphold this reputation we've gained to the best of our ability."

 shbh_aljazirat_alearabia_desc: "For centuries the Arabian Peninsula has been divided, feuding within itself over politics and religion. Whether it was one tribe versus another or Sunnis versus Shiites versus Ibadis, the entirety of the region has known little peace since the time of the last great Caliphate. Now though, through our hard work and astute leadership, we have become the catalayst and the holders of a new golden era of the Arabian Peninsula that sees not division and destruction, but rather cooperation and prosperity. With this, we will do all that we can to defend what we have fought so hard for; and when our enemies are driven back from our great home, we will be sure they never threaten us again."

 carpet_and_rug_industry_desc: "Kerman is famous for its plethora of carpets and rugs that are made of high quality material and produced by only those of Kerman. More and more we are seeing the exports of our carpets and rugs expand as the trade routes around us grow more crowded with people, so why should we stop at what production methods we currently use? Refining the processes to make our fine products over time will help make Kerman into a city famous all around the world for its woven exports."
 kavir_e_lut_desert_and_mountains: "Lut Desert and Mountains"
 kavir_e_lut_desert_and_mountains_desc: "The Lut Desert and the surrounding mountains are a gift to Kerman and its people. Safe within the confines of them, few invaders would try to besiege our lands for a prolonged period of time, for they know that the hostile environment will eat away at them as they fight us on home territory."
 memory_of_conquest: "Memory of Conquest"
 memory_of_conquest_desc: "When the Seljuk Turks came from the north, Kerman maintained a great deal of independence and made great strides in expanding itself. The leaders of Kerman conquered swaths of land to the south and southeast before being culled by other powers later on. Still, the heart of conquest beats inside of the city and its people, and the memory of the past conquests are not yet lost on our people."

 festivals_of_kerman_desc: "Our foundations in the likes of the Sassanid Empire has given us a great deal of tradition and cultural identity that few can compare with. Even our great festivals date back to the days of the Sassanid Empire in their origin, style, and structure, giving us not only grand times of celebration, but an enriched and prestigious culture as well."
 more_than_just_an_outpost: "More than an Outpost"
 more_than_just_an_outpost_desc: "Ardashir I, founder of the once great Sassanid Empire, founded Kerman initially as a defensive outpost in the east, thinking little else of the land and the population of Kerman itself afterwards. Times have changed over the centuries, however, and we are more akin to a great city than a mere outpost. From humble foundations upward, we must seize power when and where we can and follow in the footsteps of our great ancestors."
 religious_cohabitation: "Religious Cohabitation"
 religious_cohabitation_desc: "Though Islam is strong in the region of Persia itself (along with Kerman), Zoroastrians are still present within Kerman itself. We understand that there is a need to preserve our cultural history and the Zoroastrians, though heathens as they may be, are intrinsically part of that cultural history. Let us see to it that others of different faiths who also contribute to our culture are not put into exile in our lands."

 iranian_familiarity_desc: "The lands of Persia know us well, but we are but one city of many famous cities in the region.

 religious_tolerance_of_the_past_desc: "From its inception from the times of the Medes to the times of Cyrus the Great and ever afterwards, Isfahan has been a bastion for not only Zoroastrians and Islamic followers, but also Jewish communities as well as Christian communities. Religious tolerance is something that is inherent within the history of our great city and it will continue to guide us long into the future, lest we wish to stray away and delve into religious strife and corrupt religious governance."
 buyid_and_seljuk_prosperity: "Buyid and Seljuk Memories"
 buyid_and_seljuk_prosperity_desc: "After the fall of the great Sassanid Empire to the Arabs of the Rashidun Caliphate, Isfahan was captured in about 642 and progressively built up despite being in the path of conquest. Later on, the Buyid Dynasty as well as the Seljuk Turks continued to build up the splendor and prosperity of Isfahan, culminating into its greatest form under Malik-Shah I (reigned 1073-1092). Though the times are very much different now and cities like Tabriz are taking over, we can very much still build our home city into something as great or even greater than what it once was. Our past tells us of what we are capable of, and it is our past that can help lead us into the future."
 build_the_defenses: "Build the Defenses"
 build_the_defenses_desc: "Isfahan's location is well suited to a defensive position as it lies within the Zagros Mountains, but time and time again there have been invasions that have crossed the mountains and come to where we live. Thus, the goal is clear for us: build up high quality and strong defensive structures along key points so that we can maintain our invaluable position in the mountains. The enemies of Isfahan will die trying to break down our great fortifications."
 beauty_of_persoiranian_architecture: "Beauty of Isfahani Architecture"
 beauty_of_persoiranian_architecture_desc: "The beauty of Isfahan is widespread, but what stands out most to people who are just entering the city for the first time? Why, it is the wondrous architecture of course! The Perso-Islamic style that we have begun to cultivate and promote throughout the entirety of the city and elsewhere is showing more and more people just how illustrious of a city Isfahan is, and with more prestige comes more influence in foreign states. Perhaps in time, others of signficant status will come to admire our hard work and use the wisdom we use in our grand structures."
 cultural_understanding: "Cultural Understanding"
 cultural_understanding_desc: "A great many people pass through Isfahan and those that choose to settle in the city often begin to contribute great amounts of work as future generations of them integrate into the wider Isfahani society. This blending of cultures is not a new notion in the slightest as the Sassanid Empire had a sizeable Jewish community settle within the limits of Isfahan at the time. By continuing this idea of cultural cooperation and understanding, we can be ready to take in new people whenever they come into our fold."
 georgian_military_slaves: "Georgian Military Services"
 georgian_military_slaves_desc: "One distinct group of people that we have great connections with are the Georgians of the north. Though different in faith, we often look past the religious differences to cooperate with each other and as such this has culminated in a wonderful military service available perhaps only to Isfahan. The military services of the Georgians have been and will continue to be greatly valued all throughout Isfahan."

The lofty place we were once atop is now so far away from it seems, but it is not out of reach. Already we are making strides to retake the prominent position we once had and already many around us are seeing us as a respectable state for the region itself. With this in mind, states beyond our home region are even noticing us and sending a plethora of merchants our way in order to do business. Who are we to deny them this lucrative right? Who are we to stop the growth of Isfahan in this new age of prosperity?"

 #relation_to_the_jalayirs_desc: "Though quite distant in their prominence as they converted to Islam and attempted to found their own state in the west, the Jalayirs are still related at the very core to us Khalkhas. We can use our connections with them to help mediate disputes when we conquer new land, especially in lands that harbor Islamic communities toward the western parts of the old Mongol Empire."
 relation_to_the_jalayirs: "Jalairs Across the Steppe"
 relation_to_the_jalayirs_desc: "The sands of time have been relatively kind to the Jalairs despite the collapse of various steppe hordes around them. Their influence stretches from the lands of the Mongols to the lands of the Iranian people, meaning that if we can entice more Jalairs to pledge fealty to us even if they are in foreign domains, we will have a much easier time annexing new territory."

 buddhist_haven_of_the_north_desc: "The Khalkha are staunchly Buddhist in their faith and traditions and they are not set on changing from this, despite what Islamic traditions come from the west and what Confucian principles may come from the south. However, we of the Khalkha must recognize that the other faiths are not inherently destructive to the Khalkha way of life or way of governance. If we can fully realize this and make efforts to promote religious harmony whilst also preserving our Buddhist roots, we'll be able to maintain firm control over own land."

 oirat_and_zungar_tensions_desc: "The Oirat and Zunghar are not simple enemies that have popped up, they are rivals of us and seek hegemony of these great lands just like we do. Throughout ruthless diplomacy and strategic warfare, we must subdue these other two groups of Mongols and project the unity brought forth by the early years of the Mongol Empire."
 learning_diplomatic_matters: "Learning Diplomatic Matters"
 learning_diplomatic_matters_desc: "Diplomacy has never been a great field for Mongol people in the past; at best we were standard at it, but others around us excelled in the diplomatic realm and got advantages over us in the past. By practicing our diplomatic approach inside our own land between tribes and between different administrative branches, we can prepare ourselves for conducting astute and careful diplomacy with foreigners."

 unite_the_disparate_mongol_tribes_desc: "The basis for the ambition to unite the entirety of the Mongol tribes is within a great many people, but to fully realize this ambition into something whole, one must learn more. The Khalkha are ready for this next step of cultural understanding and cooperation as the many different groups that inhabit the lands north of the Middle Kingdom will need to be accepted and integrated rather than excluded and persecuted."
 organization_of_the_khalkhas: "Organizing the Khalkhas"
 organization_of_the_khalkhas_desc: "The system of old tribes and clans has done us well for a long time, but the Khalkhas are changing like many other people around us. They are learning, adapting, and changing in their culture on the largest scale we administrate from all the way down to the individual Khalkha person. We need not halt this change over time, rather, we need to learn how to organize ourselves within these changes and manage how they are implemented throughout our society. If we can do so, not even time itself will pose a threat to the Khalkha people."

Being outside of the Middle Kingdom and in the vast steppe region, our history is undoubtedly intertwined with the legends of before, such as the Four Oirats, the Northern Yuan, the Uzbeks, the Kazakhs, and many other groups. Zungharia is but a small part of this entire place, but it is our homeland and as any homeland should, it deserves to be united through any means possible."

 rivalry_against_the_khalkhas_desc: "They have been our rivals for a great many years now and it does not seem like we are going to find peace anytime soon. Whoever shows the most martial prowess and the greatest leadership skills in the steppe is the one that comes out on top and we of Zungharia will show this through the fires of war. The Khalkhas will submit to the true authority of the steppe that are the leaders of Zungharia."

 cut_down_pretenders_desc: "Our power may seem secure to those outside of our realm, but on the inside, we know there are people who plot the downfall of the Zunghar people and their state. Whether in the form of palace coups or open separatist revolts, we must actively work to gather information on these groups of rebels and cut them down before they can prove to be deadly to us."
 influences_in_tibet: "Influences in Tibet"
 influences_in_tibet_desc: "Long have the hordes of the steppe had interests in the lands of Tibet as the Dalai Lama, the foremost spiritual leader for our branch of Buddhism, hails from and is usually found inside Tibetan land. By extending our influence beyond our nominal borders and using our connections through faith, we can promote not only a greater spiritual unity amongst the Zunghar people, but also a greater legitimate authority over the entirety of the steppe."
 buying_new_weaponry: "Buying New Weapons"
 buying_new_weaponry_desc: "From the west and the south, new weapons are coming in that are far more effective than our traditional bow-and-arrow, even on horseback. Traders from the mentioned regions are often willing to sell these new weapons for a price and we are most assuredly willing to buy them if they can help us defeat those rivals around us."

 take_the_throne_of_the_steppe_desc: "The steppe is a harsh place full of warring states and different people groups, but there was a time of unity throughout that we look back upon fondly. Yes, the Mongol Empire is no more, but that does not mean another state cannot claim the throne they left vacant!

Perhaps in time we can conquer back east and greet our old family members."

 surrounding_military_influences_desc: "The Russian military and the Turkish military are influential on us, just like how we as a political entity are influential on them. Though we are used to more cavalry-based tactics that have served us well in the Steppe for decades upon decades, the new weapons and strategies brought to light by the Russians and Turks should be examined thoroughly and in time, integrated into our own military."

Even today this trait runs through the Kalmyks since in the past we have faced times where different groups of people proclaim a different khan than the actual one in line for the throne. We must work to resolve these political struggles as they go on and then work to make sure they are few and far between in the future.

Seeing that arrangements were well and good, and because we were not in any position to really resist, we agreed and became subjects for generations on end. Now though, the Mongols are broken and shattered, scavenging for resources and leadership whilst the Buryats roam free again.

It has been passed down to us for generations now with varying influences from the southern religions of Buddhism and Tengrism, but the notion of our people and our own religion has not gone away despite there being no holy text or scripture to follow. We should not, however, be closed off to the old religious influences, for they too can relate to our own and may hold wisdom for the Buryats themselves."
 migration_and_semi_nomadic_life: "Semi-Nomadic Life"
 migration_and_semi_nomadic_life_desc: "The harsh lands we live in does not lend itself easily to a settled life full of agriculture. The tundre and cold weather often make life difficult for settled folks to thrive in, thus encouraging more of a semi-nomadic way of life, which the Buryats have had for centuries now.

Concentrating efforts on building up Damot cities and towns will help bring prosperity and sense of growing power to the nation itself, something we deserve after all these years."
 professional_damot_fighters: "Making a Professional Military"
 professional_damot_fighters_desc: "With our military experience from the past and from the Oromo migrations, the Damot have the potential to make a more standardized and professional military. It may require reforms and formalization of certain sectors, but the advantages of building upon our military traditions of the recent past will help ensure a bright future for Damot as a whole."
 damot_administrative_measures: "Administrative Approaches"
 damot_administrative_measures_desc: "The administration of Damot is what should be timeless as we go forth, constantly reforming and taking up new ideas so as to help keep laws, legislation, taxes, and many other matters in order. Without this reform-minded attitude, Damot would be left to wither away in the shadows."

 stability_of_welayta: "Stability of Welayta"
 stability_of_welayta_desc: "Welayta, our kingdom, has been around for centuries without changing much in terms of size. From our defeat in the north centuries ago, we have managed to maintain a viable position in this southern area (in comparison to Ethiopia) for a very long time now. Our stability here is what gives us strength, and our administration's ability to maintain societal cohesion in Welayta is what continues to keep us afloat."
 centuries_of_presence: "Centuries of Presence"
 centuries_of_presence_desc: "With our presence over such a long time, our reputation amongst our neighbors naturally increases... For the most part. Though we still have rivals near our borders, many of our neighbors recognize the great age of the Welayta state and are willing to respect our longevity in the region."
 damot_lineage: "Damot Lineage"
 damot_lineage_desc: "In our past, the legends passed down to us tell of our old kingdom being called 'Damot'. Was this akin to the Damot we know of today? We cannot be sure, but the myth resonates with the Welayta people enough so that the royal court of Welayta is seen as being connected to the one of Damot, granting a sense of reputation that many high-minded people of our home region are attracted to."
 oromo_tensions: "Oromo Tensions"
 oromo_tensions_desc: "Like many other states around us, the Oromo migrations are a source of great tension for Welayta. How others deal with the Oromo is not for us to think about, we simply need to ensure that we can beat them out in a head-to-head conflict. How does one do that? By having a strong-willed and disciplined military that can overcome whatever tactics are employed by the Oromo. To ensure the integrity of the Welayta state, we must be able to fight."
 mitigate_ethnic_tensions: "Mitigate Ethnic Tensions"
 mitigate_ethnic_tensions_desc: "The ethnic makeup of the region has indeed changed since the Oromo migrations. With these changes, we are experiencing societal tension the likes of which aren't used to but that must be dealt with. If we can resettle certain communities to our outer reaches whilst also maintaining the integrity of our inner areas, then we may very well be able to withstand this new era of ethnic tension."
 welayta_survivability: "Welayta Surviabiity"
 welayta_survivability_desc: "With the location of the Welayta heartland, being able to survive in harsh conditions is a natural requirement and something that is found within all Welayta soldiers. We even prepare our troops with training in the rough lands in our outskirts, meaning that they get firsthand experience of what terrain they will be fighting in."
 reform_the_kingdom: "Reforming the Kingdom"
 reform_the_kingdom_desc: "The kingdom has lasted a very long time with peaceful and terible times mixed in throughout its life but still it remains alive.

 horses_to_ethiopia: "Horses to Ethiopia"
 horses_to_ethiopia_desc: "In the past, we have contributed tribute to Ethiopia in the form of horses amongst other resources. We should be inclined to use some of these horses for our own military rather than giving them all to Ethiopia since they will surely get horses from other places, not just Janjiro."

 the_mwa_clan_desc: "The Mwa Clan is the clan from where many of our leaders have been elected from and to this day they still continue be influential in our politics to this day. Though the power of the Mwa Clan shifts around as time goes on, we should not underestimate their power and we should continue to utilize their influence to help promote our lead dynasty."
 janjiros_isolation: "Janjiros Isolation"
 janjiros_isolation_desc: "Traditionally we have been isolated from several other kingdoms and states due to our location. The mountains and rivers make for nearly impassable terrain entrances into Janjiro land and it is because of this isolation that we can administrate the land much better than other places. Keeping track of communities is fairly easy and building up laws of land is also fairly easy as compared to having huge tracts of land that are hard to manage."
 no_soldier_killed_in_action: "No Soldier Lost In Battle!"
 no_soldier_killed_in_action_desc: "We must not let our enemies drip the blood of our own soldiers on our own land! Should a soldier wounded in battle come back to Janjiro, they will be given blessings by our leader and executed by their own family members. Our enemies can't claim to have killed Janjiro soldiers in battle for they are the greatest warriors around! Let our enemies taste no victory in our land!"
 control_the_raging_rivers: "Controlling the Rivers"
 control_the_raging_rivers_desc: "The rivers around us are known for keeping our heartland fairly isolated but they are not alone in trying to gain easy access across them. If we can build sufficent bridges, learn the regular changes in the flow of the rivers, or perhaps build strong enough boats to go across the rivers, we can achieve a greater amount of overall movement speed for our military and civilian population which will be useful in the future."
 contacts_with_ethiopia: "Contacts with Ethiopia"
 contacts_with_ethiopia_desc: "As we progressively come out of our isolation, what will help us greatly is our connection to Ethiopia. Diplomatic endeavors through them has introduced us slowly to the wider world, easing us into things rather than just dropping us into the international stage without experience."
 the_three_mountains: "The Three Mountains"
 the_three_mountains_desc: "Mount Bor Ama, Mount Azulu, and Mount Toba are the three traditional mountain markers of the Kingdom of Janjiro. They are our foundation, the bedrock by which we built up a secure yet isolated life; the three mountains are what continue to help give our poeple strength whether it is times of natural disasters or in times of deadly plagues. No person may tear our foundation down; no nation may conquer the mountains like we have."

 horses_of_hadiya_desc: "Hadiya is a place rich in horses and other resources that are valuable for making a nation grand and worthy of surviving the test of time. With regard to horses, our land is able to cultivate a great many and use them not only for grazing purposes, but for extensive military purposes as well. We'd be foolish to not use our horses as such!"
 iron_currency: "Iron Currency"
 iron_currency_desc: "Regulating our own currency is something prestigous in its own right and we of Hadiya take pride in this. With iron being what our currency is made of, regulating it on our own and making our economy more so dependent on it as opposed to a different nation's currency will help sustain Hadiya as a whole."
 uphold_hadiya_fertility: "Hadiya Fertility"
 uphold_hadiya_fertility_desc: "The lands of Hadiya have continued to be fertile for generations without end and we are forever thankful for this. With this fertility of the land, we must use what we get from it properly by building up our towns and cities as well as our infrastructure from the ground up. Without this foundational element of Hadiya properly built up, our administration and our military will be without enough resources altogether."

 religious_wars_horn_of_africa_desc: "The battle between the Cross and the Star-and-Crescent in the Horn of Africa has been around for centuries now and there is no clear end in sight. We of Hadiya must raise the banner of Islam against the likes of Ethiopia and its cadre of subject states so that there can be peace in the region. And even after there is peace in the Horn, Hadiya must carry the legacy forth and toward other ends of Africa and beyond."
 question_of_the_oromo: "Question of the Oromo"
 question_of_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo migrations have caused a great amount of turmoil in our region but we are not so opposed to them as our neighbors to the west have been. True, the Oromo have caused tension with the Hadiya people, but they are not without their advantages if they can be negotiated with properly and integrated into a wider society as a whole."
 adal_connections: "Adal Connections"
 adal_connections_desc: "The Sultanate of Adal may not be the most friendly power to Hadiya, but they are of Sunni Islam and have pledged to help our people at times against the likes of Ethiopia itself. We can and should use our diplomatic ties inside of Adal to connect to other Islamic nations so that Hadiya is not progressively isolated."
 royal_hadiya_military: "Royal Hadiya Military"
 royal_hadiya_military_desc: "With our military heralding the success of Hadiya in its expansion and defense, formalizing it into something more professional and educating the leaders of the Hadiya military in various strategies not found necessarily in our region will provide us with a strong base for future conquests."

 after_the_fall_of_adal: "After the Fall of Adal"
 after_the_fall_of_adal_desc: "With the memory of Adal as a political entity withering away in the minds of many, we must pick up where they left off. The sword on the ground, the weapon nearby, and the armor with blood on it, we must pick all of it up and keep up the eternal struggle against the likes of the Christians in the west!"
 steeped_in_islam: "Steeped in Islam"
 steeped_in_islam_desc: "Much like how Ethiopia is drenched in Christianity, the likes of our state are bound up permanently with Islam. With the zeal of Islam that once backed up the Adal Sultanate now backing our cause, we will seek out all places where infidels lay in our land and bring them to the glorious light of Allah! No evil can stay hidden for long, especially in the Horn of Africa!"
 survival_of_the_fittest: "Fight to Survive"
 survival_of_the_fittest_desc: "With the failure of Adal, we are left on our own in the harsh environment of the Horn of Africa. Born into this firey region of constant political struggles and seemingly endless warfare, we must rally our people to the cause of simply keeping our state alive. It's a matter of trying to survive first, then attempting to thrive, but neither are going to come easily for us."
 fighting_the_oromo_migrations: "Oromo Threats"
 fighting_the_oromo_migrations_desc: "The Oromo are a destabilizing force in many states and they don't seem to care much for what harm they cause on the political level. We need to ensure that we have a large enough military to take on not only take on the Oromo migrations but also to take on any attacks from our neighbors."
 integrate_firearms: "Usage of Firearms"
 integrate_firearms_desc: "The usage of firearms was only just being introduced to the Adal Sultanate when it fell which means we can pick up where they left off at. Integrating our military with cannons and firearms and also importing some from neighboring Islamic nations will help us combat the advances from our Christian neighbors."
 quell_the_dynastic_fights: "Quell Dynastic Fights"
 quell_the_dynastic_fights_desc: "If there is one ever-present matter in our nation that was also part of the fall of the Adal Sultanate, it is dynastic disputes. We need to work on a way to solve these matters once and for all so that we do not suffer the same internal illness that the Adal Sultanate did. Imams and Viziers alike can contribute to this deathly fate and thus we will need to deal with them too."
 toward_victory: "Toward Victory!"
 toward_victory_desc: "Adal's fall did not seal our fate away, rather, it let a new force shine through that is capable of picking up where they left off. We do not see the threat of the western Christians as a reason to cower in fear, but rather we see the threat as something to be challenged at all levels! We must and will fight them and seek a victory that for some, seems impossible! Onward, toward victory!"

 metals_across_the_land: "Strike the Earth!"
 metals_across_the_land_desc: "Our lands are not as fertile as those at the shores of the Caspian or Black Sea, but it does have several places where something else can be harvested for raw and manufactured value: metals and minerals! Though the mines are still in their early days, increasingly we are seeing people both internally and externally interested in what our lands have to produce besides ferocious fighters. What else is there to do for us other than striking the earth and reaping the rewards!"
 #from_the_tiele: "From the Tiele"
 #from_the_tiele_desc: "The Bashkirs date back to the times of the anciete Tiele, a confederation of nomadic tribes that emerged after the ancient Xiongnu confederation of tribes broke up entirely. With such an ancient lineage, we are able to earn respect and honor amongst our neighbors who also recount stories from so long ago."
 sunni_horde_conquest: "Sunni Conquests"
 sunni_horde_conquest_desc: "Much like our neighbors down south, except for perhaps the Iranians, conquest by Sunni states is something that almost comes naturally. Despite sayings of piety and religious doctrine here and there, the steppe know few such laws in reality and the Bashkirs will readily take advantage of both this fact and the legacy of Sunni Muslims conquering great swaths of land in the name of Islam and for themselves."
 holders_for_centuries: "Holders for Centuries"
 holders_for_centuries_desc: "For centuries we have resided where we are, not budging and remaining resolute despite what is thrown at us. Military traditions from our ancestors do not go unknown by any Bashkir fighter or military leader and as such they continue to fight with the same ferocity that our ancestors once did."
 turkic_language_intelligibility: "Turkic Language Intelligibility"
 turkic_language_intelligibility_desc: "Our language is mutually intelligible with several other Turkic languages to a degree, and while we can't understand every single thing our cousins say to us, the fact that we can understand a good amount between us goes a long way toward acceptance and tolerance. The more Turkic kin we come into contact with, the better!"
 bashkir_military_tradition: "Bashkir Military Traditions"
 bashkir_military_tradition_desc: "The militarized mentality of the Bashkirs should not be wasted in the slightest. The zeal with which our people fight when defending the land and when they are among the conquering forces of a different land is unparalleled. We should utilize this zeal for more concrete purposes such as expanding the military sector as a whole and ensuring that it has the best possible chance for success against our enemies."
 traditional_steppe_warfare: "Traditional Steppe Warfare"
 traditional_steppe_warfare_desc: "Despit the introduction of firearms, we still prefer the old ways of cavalry armies and tactics. Bashkirs know just how devastating a cavalry charge along with ranged cavalry tactics can be, especially on the wide open steppe, which is why we still utilize them to this day. In any flat terrain setting, our forces will be sure to have the edge against our foes."
 a_formal_bashkir_military: "Formalize the Fighting Force"
 a_formal_bashkir_military_desc: "With such a strong and grand military foundation, the logical next step is to formalize and standardize the Bashkirs into a fully capable fighting force on par with our neighbors. They may think the Bashkirs can't field that large of an army from the lands of the steppe, but we will prove them wrong."

 AST_ideas_bonus: "Astrakhani Ambition"
 against_the_golden_horde: "Against the Golden Horde"
 against_the_golden_horde_desc: "Breaking away from the Golden Horde and its remnant state, the Great Horde, is no small feat. It takes courage and strength to renounce the old ways of leadership and to begin forging a new path on our own, but with this strength in our hearts and minds, the soldiers and civilians of Astrakhan will go forth and paint a new and brighter future for the region soon enough."
 intersection_of_trade_routes: "Intersection of Trade Routes"
 intersection_of_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come from all directions intersect at the end of the Volga River as it flows into the Caspian Sea. Our land is one of opportunity and mercantile matters just as much as military affairs and we would be foolish to not capitalize on both. The latter, however, is inherent within Astrakhan, but capitalizing on trade? That is something we will certainly need to work on as time goes by."
 structured_feudal_ranks: "Structured Feudal Ranks"
 structured_feudal_ranks_desc: "Unlike some other khanates, Astrakhan has an ordered and structured social hierarchy that is maintained internally, not by some overlord nation from afar. With this in mind, we can and should integrate new people into this system as time goes on so that they are productive in our land, rather than wandering beggars."
 a_volatile_region: "Our Volatile Region"
 a_volatile_region_desc: "Though there is great opportunity in our region, there is also a great amount of warfare present within it and the successor states to the Golden Horde know this all too well. We of Astrakhan are keen on seeing this period of conflict through to the end despite what our past series of wars and conflicts have indicated; there must be peace and prosperity and our military will fight for this goal without end."
 placate_the_nogais: "Placate the Nogai"
 placate_the_nogais_desc: "A sizable portion of our population are not just Astrakhani, but rather related kin of ours called the Nogai. Though we are family, that does not mean there are not familial tensions between us and often times this has broken out into revolts against our authority in the past. In the future, we need to work on placating and cooperating with our Nogai brothers and sisters instead of forcing them into one single path; cooperation with them can and most likely will lead to more internal stability both in the military and in civilian life."
 become_a_bastion_for_islam: "Becoming an Islamic Bastion"
 become_a_bastion_for_islam_desc: "Islam has its roots far to our south and has reached to the Volga River via conquest and voluntary conversions, but to the north are Christians intent on converting Islamic communities at any cost. As we are the forefront of Islam's spread northward we should strive to become a bastion of the faith and build up our capital to be a center of Islamic learning and culture. If we can do this over time, we will see a rise in faithful adherents coming to our land to aid us in our many endeavors."
 succeed_the_old_khans: "Succeed the Old Khans"
 succeed_the_old_khans_desc: "The ways of the old khans, those of the Golden Horde, the Ilkhanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Yuan Dynasty, are gone. No longer can we rely on their traditions of the past to guide us into the dense fog of the future; instead, we must rely on our own skills, abilities, and intuition, making a new path for our leaders and officials. Let out people no longer walk the path of our ancestors, for that path has ended. Now begins the new path, that of Astrakhan."

 QAS_ideas_bonus: "Qasimi Ambition"
 muscovite_influences: "Muscovite Influences"
 muscovite_influences_desc: "The influences from our north have seeped into the everyday lives of Qasimi people. Though they are firmly Tatar in culture and ethnicity, ways of governing and administrating the land have become somewhat 'Russified' and as such are taking on a mixed form. This has the result of making politics somewhat easier to handle and it is also resulting in a more flexible administration which is something Qasim will undoubtedly need in the future."
 ryazan_memories: "Ryazani Memories"
 ryazan_memories_desc: "The Principality of Ryazan once held the land we now hold as our own, but the memories of them still hold weight with us. A distinctly non-Russian yet simultaneously somewhat Russian state at the edge of what has traditionally seen as the lands of the Rus, that is what Qasim now holds itself as... For now, at least."
 avenues_for_expansion: "Avenues for Expansion"
 avenues_for_expansion_desc: "When swept away of political boundaries on maps, the land we are situated has few natural borders aside from rivers; mostly flat land for roaming and grazing is what Qasim is used to seeing. As such, this land can easily be conquered on paper, that is. Actually doing so is another matter entirely and we will need extensive measures in the Qasimi administration to afford these conquered lands. With the partially Russified and flexible administration we have, it should not be that large of an endeavor."
 kazan_rivalry: "The Kazan Rivalry"
 kazan_rivalry_desc: "The Kazan Khanate is the one that is perhaps our greatest rival, or has been in the past. Strong in leadership and military skill, they have proven time and time again that Qasim needs to rebuff and strengthen its military whenever possible. It, the Qasimi military, must learn and revise old tactics and strategies used by the ancestors of the past and be ready to integrate newer military practices whenever possible."
 lands_of_a_buffer_state: "Lands of a Buffer State"
 lands_of_a_buffer_state_desc: "Similar to how Ryazan was a sort of buffer state between the khans of the south and the lands of the Rus to the north, Qasim is put into a somewhat similar position. Though the lands may be that of a buffer state in the eyes of neighboring powers, these are the lands by which the Qasimi call home and will defend to the very end. This has diplomatic benefits too as neighboring states may be inclined to gain influence over these 'buffer lands', but we will be sure to not let them diplomatically subjugate us."
 reformed_administrative_leadership: "Reformed Administrative Leadership"
 reformed_administrative_leadership_desc: "With our administration coming along nicely and the Qasimi realm becoming a more potent force in the field of diplomacy and on the field of battle, we should be inclined toward reforming the central administration itself into a more robust and meritocratic system. Noble blood has its place within Qasim, but we cannot deny that education and skills in specific areas are making for outstanding individuals in Qasim, some of whom could certainly benefit the state as a whole if we were to hire them."
 defend_tatar_statehood: "Defend Tatar Statehood"
 defend_tatar_statehood_desc: "As we have threats from all directions still, a Tatar state is becoming a real idea in the minds of many in Qasim, but in the minds of some our neighbors? It is a foul thought that should be stamped out at once! Constantly under threat of military invasion of political intervention, the Qasimi people need to stand tall against these threats and show discipline in the face of abhorrent evil! Statehood will be achieved for Qasim and the Tatar people and there will be a valiant defense of it no matter what!"

 barbary_influences_desc: "The corsairs of the North African coast are renowned for their ruthless nature and their raids on Christian coasts and our coast has some of the best spots for them. The influence they hold in Tripoli is strong and we should be looking to cooperate with them so that we can steer trade income more toward us as opposed to elsewhere."
 control_over_inner_tribes: "Control the Inner Tribes"
 control_over_inner_tribes_desc: "Tripoli is known for its coast, not its inland part, for good reason. The coastal cities are lucrative for trade and havens for corsairs whilst the inner desert sands are home to roaming tribes of Berbers that are quite hard to control. This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli. Utilizing them and making diplomatic deals with them so that we can slowly integrate them into the Tripolitanian state will help ensure that we can stay afloat in terms of reserve forces."
 tripolitanian_trade_measures: "Tripolitanian Trade Measures"
 tripolitanian_trade_measures_desc: "The trade along our coasts is lucrative, but dangerous for many, which is just how we like things. By taking greater control of trade measures and markets around us, we can start exerting more force on our neighbors and funneling trade into where we want it most. A few bloodied coins is fine, so long as the end profit comes to us."
 commanding_the_southern_med: "Commanding the Southern Mediterannean"
 commanding_the_southern_med_desc: "The Southern Mediterannean is rife with corsairs but not all of them are our own. We must begin to consolidate power over the coastal bases and promote our navy throughout the entirety of the Southern Mediterannean without mercy and without leniency so that we are ready for any threat out on the water."
 diplomatic_intrigue: "Diplomatic Intrigue"
 diplomatic_intrigue_desc: "The extension of Tripolitanian power outward toward other regions is known by many and as such diplomatic measures are being made toward us actively. We need to ensure that we can diplomatically manuever ourselves around the international stage well enough so that our rivals are not able to gain influence against us whilst our allies are seeing only the best side of us. Tripoli is a valuable place for many, who in the Mediterannean wouldn't be interested in it?"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy: "The Fight for Naval Supremacy"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy_desc: "The constant fight for dominance on the open water gives the navy of Tripoli consistent experience in combat, meaning that they are adept at fighting at both range and up close during naval encounters. Some of our top admirals are even keen on capturing enemy ships so that they can be repaired and used in the main Tripolitanian fleet later on, a strategy that may just come in handy sooner rather than later."
 construct_naval_bases: "Construct Naval Bases"
 construct_naval_bases_desc: "The entrances into Tripolitanian land that aren't harsh desert or small coastal villages are the main ports where trade funnels into. These are often times vulnerable to enemy ships firing on them or from invasion inland which, in both cases, puts the very life of Tripoli itself in danger. The answer? Naval bases and fortifications so that we can defend our fleets during repairs, construct ships at a faster rate, and also defend ourselves in a much more organized manner."

 monsoon_trade_complex_desc: "We of Sofala are part of the great Monsoon Marketplace, to put it informally, and just as we contribute to it through trade we also receive from it via revenue. Continuing this bountiful exchange of people, goods, services, and materials will serve to cement Sofala's position as a key port for many around East Africa."
 positive_kilwa_influences: "Kilwa's Good Side"
 positive_kilwa_influences_desc: "Kilwa's attempts to influence Sofala and its people was not purely bad since we learned a lot in regards to boats, how they are built, and what uses they have for the rivers we surround. By keeping this knowledge in use at the docks and harbors of Sofala, we'll continue to have strong and combat-ready vessels fit for the protection of Sofalan waters."
 swahili_and_mutapan_population: "Swahili and Mutapan People"
 swahili_and_mutapan_population_desc: "The two main people in our land are the Swahili and the Mutapan people, both of which are crucial to everyday matters from administration to diplomatic affairs. If we can manipulate both people groups effectively within Sofala, we can use the connections they have in foreign nations around us to gain positive influence elsewhere."
 vying_for_independent_control: "Sofala's Struggle"
 vying_for_independent_control_desc: "Kilwa has had interests in Sofala for a long while, as have the Mutapan leaders further upstream from where Sofala's capital is. This constant struggle to maintain an independent state free from the overbearing influence of Kilwan or Mutapan lords has led our people to looking to us for legitimacy since we our struggle so far as been met with success."
 promote_harbor_building: "Harbor Infrastructure"
 promote_harbor_building_desc: "Without our harbors, we are nothing as a state. They are the entry and exit point into Sofala for a great many people and will need to be kept in the best shape possible for future endeavors, whether they are mercantile in nature or for military purposes since ships of the Sofalan navy are also docked inside these harbors."
 renovate_production_infrastructure: "Production Refinement"
 renovate_production_infrastructure_desc: "The productive potential of Sofala is not to be underestimated. Our capital of Sofala was founded purely because of how lucrative resource extraction was from the location and even to this day it is the site of a great amount of resource extraction. Refining our production methods is the only natural choice for us now so that we can keep this up."
 seaport_of_the_south: "The Great Southern Seaport"
 seaport_of_the_south_desc: "With our power almost unrestricted and our infrastructure both inland and by the coast growing at a healthy rate, trade revenue should become the direct focus of Sofala in the future. Increasing the efforts we put into maximizing trade profits and advantageous trade deals is what will grant Sofala success and prosperity in the future."

With this in mind, the Akamatsu Clan has been a key supporter of the Ashikaga Shogunate ever since and has been integrated well within the politics within Kyoto itself. Keeping this political participation going will only garner the Akamatsu Clan more prosperity as time goes on."

 patronize_the_five_mountains_literature_desc: "Akamatsu Norimura and indeed the rest of the Akamatsu Clan have been great patrons of the Buddhist sect that Sesson Yubai belonged to. Yubai himself being a Zen Buddhist monk, he is often regarded the first important poet of the Five Mountains; the Five Mountains being considered literature produced by the principal Zen monastic centers of Yubai's sect, Rinzai. As we go forth, we would be wise to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and continue patronizing the literature of the Five Mountains whether it be for spreading the teachings or for promoting the Rinzai sect."

 support_the_rinzai_school_desc: "The Rinzai School has its roots in Japan in 1168 with Myoan Eisai. After his initial efforts and after the work of those like Nanpo Shomyo, Sesson Yubai, Shuho Myocho, and Muso Soseki (the latter two did not travel back to China at all to study, giving the school a truly Japanese flavor) the Rinzai School of Zen Buddhism became favored by both the samurai class and by the powers in Kyoto because it actively supported the shogun himself. The Akamatsu Clan being one of the great patrons of the school itself will have an edge in politics and military affairs because of them."

 succeed_the_minamoto_clan_desc: "The Heian Period is long gone and so is the influence of the four great clans that dominated politics during that period: the Fujiwara, the Taira, the Tachibana, and the Minamoto Clan. The Akamatsu Clan being a descedant of the Minamoto Clan gives it a clear sense of power and prominence elsewhere throughout Japan and even in Kyoto itself. This is power that cannot simply be bought or taken by the cut of a sword or firing of a musket, no, this is power that can only be had by being of the correct blood and family."

 general_and_captain_experience_desc: "Maeda Clan members have been seen in several armies around Japan. Many daimyo incorporate our members so that they can succeed in battle, yet these battles serve to also strengthen the Maeda Clan itself. The tactics and strategies used in these battles will be sorted through by Maeda Clan officers so that they can be refined and used for our own uses later on."

 contention_with_ikko_ikki_desc: "Disruptions by the Ikko-Ikki are abound in the lands of several daimyo and they are invoking military conflicts between peasant and noble populations.

Our troops must always be ready for whatever comes their way."

 in_the_heart_of_the_sengoku_desc: "Being at the center or near center of conflicts during the Sengoku Jidai has led to the Maeda Clan becoming more militaristic and adept at warfare in a variety of settings. Let nothing stand in the way of us when the banners of war fly high! Let the fires of war scorch the land and leave nothing by the Maeda Clan standing at the end of it all! Only the strongest and greatest of the daimyo in Japan will survive to the end and we are set on making sure that is us!"

 settle_the_o_le_so_do_disputes_desc: "Because of how political matters work within our realm, the Maeda Clan as well as many others are beset by O-le Sodo, or, house strife. Typically identified as disputes between noble families these conflicts can often lead to the destruction of important relationships between members of the Maeda Clan and also others outside the Maeda Clan. We need to work on a system to sort out and effectively work through these noble disputes before they can escalate into civil disturbances that grind our administration to a halt."
 establish_kanazawa: "Kanazawa Headquarters"
 establish_kanazawa_desc: "The establishment of Kanazawa as the center of the Maeda Clan is crucial. Instead of moving from place to place and moving politics wherever our political leaders are, we can have a stationary set of buildings that all Maeda Clan members report to at some point. Administration can be done more easily through this system rather than through a somewhat migratory system."
 ordered_cadet_branches: "Strictly Ordered Cadet Branches"

 kanazawa_castle_desc: "The completion of Kanazawa for administrative purposes would be the building of a proper castle.

Trained in martial arts and the leader of a unit of 200 female muskteers, Ikeda Sen went forth a was prominent volunteer for various clans around Japan before coming back to serve under the Ikeda Clan itself. She even held land in her own right and received a few fiefdoms as a result of her work and dealings. We would be fools to let her example pass by into the annals of history, no, instead we will take her example with pride strengthen the Ikeda Clan as much as possible through her legacy."

 political_maneuvers_around_kyoto_desc: "By fighting loyally for certain daimyo, exacting revenge in certain places, bribing officials, marrying off family relatives, and even seizing land for ourselves, the Ikeda Clan is no strange to politics in Japan. Using the skills the members of the Ikeda Clan have in terms of both normal and shady diplomacy will bolster our work both in the short and long term."

 reconnect_the_ikeda_domains_desc: "Previously, our domains were divided by both various daimyo and geographic details. Now that we are becoming an ever-stronger presence throughout Japan itself, we can finally connect these scattered domains into one solid, contiguous state without interruption. From here, we will be able to project much more power than before."
 shogun_of_western_japan: "'Saigoku no Shogun'"
 shogun_of_western_japan_desc: "With such power coming to us, some are now calling our leader the 'saigoku no shogun' or, Shogun of Western Japan. This is laughable to others outside our domain, but we are not taking this title lightly. Instead, the Ikeda Clan needs to capitalize on it and move to continue building up its power. The title of being the Shogun of Western Japan will help incorporate new people into our domain as few can even challenge our authority as it is."

 seizure_of_power_desc: "The ultimate authority in the land must and will be the Ikeda Clan. The Ashikaga Clan overthrew the Kamakura Shogunate and established themselves as the holders of Japan, now the time must come for the Ashikaga Shogunate to be humbled.

 methodical_order_of_succession: "Methodical Order of Succession"
 methodical_order_of_succession_desc: "The method by which the heir is chosen and ascends to the throne is often times too complex or dragged into the mud by intrigue and corrupt ties.

 improve_court_meritocracy_desc: "Where previously we may have relied on noble blood to fill our court with advisors and courtiers, we are rapidly moving into an age where merit and skill is valued over simple status and dynastic relation. Perak needs to adjust itself internally from the top down to form a more merit-based court that can promote new ideas and innovation whilst also attracting great scholars from around the region."

 struggles_for_unification_desc: "The Malay Peninsula has been divided ever since the Sultanate of Malacca came tumbling down; now we are one of the successors left to pick up the pieces that are scattered around. Whether by diplomatic subjugation or simple conquest, we need to bring the entirety of the peninsula under our control before external powers begin invading. The claims are already set, we just simply need to strike at the correct time."

Instead, Johor will be taking the initiative and make moves against the enemy first before they can get going with troop movements."
 militarize_the_land: "Militarize the Peninsula"
 militarize_the_land_desc: "The Malay Peninsula is suitable for trade and naval bases, but the inland areas are relatively hard to cultivate for military purposes and actual thriving cities and towns. We must slowly change this as time goes on and build up a land force (with infrastructure like barracks and training camps included) that is just as capable as our navy is."

It is our duty to cut down these petty warlords and to assert rightful dominance over both small villages and large towns alike so that our path to reunification is firm and whole."
 near_the_heart_of_power: "Near the Heart of Power"
 near_the_heart_of_power_desc: "We of Tonkin are near the heart of where Vietnamese power has been for generations: Dong Kinh. Consolidating power here and asserting our authority in these lands of the north will grant us more formalized resources from Chinese towns and cities north and northeast of Dong Kinh. With such resources at our disposal, we will be ready to launch campaign after campaign for our rightful lands."

 masters_of_the_tropics_desc: "The harsh terrain that we call home is on the east side of the Annamite Range. While we have open access to the water for trade and sailing, not far from the coast is lush, dense forest and jungle that is hard to traverse by most foreigners. It is this natural defensive barrier that we will use to our advantage when they come into our land; they will face ambushes frequently and fierce resistance with every village and town they come across, their time here will make them regret ever arriving!"
 peace_with_our_neighbors: "Make Peace; Make Friends"
 peace_with_our_neighbors_desc: "Because of our position in the north, we are able to maintain good relations and good standing with mutliple powers. Tonkin's respect grows not only with time and fostering good relations with neighboring states, but also throughout controlling and making Dong Kinh itself prosper."

 turn_away_the_christian_cross_desc: "People with faiths foreign to our lands, people with strange crosses and talks of this 'Jesus' figure, they do not belong in our land. For too long with have toiled with Buddhist, Confucian, and Hindu relations in our own land and these alone are proving to be a somewhat difficult to handle. These 'christians' are only going to be more a threat to Vietnamese society as a whole!"

 purchase_new_weapons_desc: "We don't have the manufacturing potential like the Chinese do for things such as firearms and cannons, but we do have money and money goes a long way in Vietnamese land and in just about every place around us. We can easily purchase new weapons for our military and cut out the process of making the weapons as a whole, the only thing we need to do is properly train our military to use such weapons."

Weak, vulnerable, ready to be conquered by foreign invaders like the Chinese or ready to be raided to no end by the Cham people.

 producing_cannons: "Producing Cannons"
 producing_cannons_desc: "Cannon making isn't the most feasible thing to do in Vietnamese land but it is done on occasion as it is. There is an option for improving our production of cannons, however, and that requires getting outside help so that we can use new designs and refinement techniques. Engaging in this transfer of information and improving our artillery sector will only serve to help cement our dominance over the traditional lands of the Vietnamese and beyond."

 taking_after_the_chinese_desc: "Though many Vietnamese people and families resent the Chinese for their invasions of our land in the past, we cannot deny that their influence upon our people has helped shaped us into who we are today. Even today we can see their military forces being more organized and well trained than our own; why don't we try to emulate this and begin doing as they do just a little bit more? Import Chinese clothing, use some of the strategies in the Chinese military, centralize matters and ensure that we can effectively command our own troops at all times."

Kutch, however, is a victim of their rather consistent in-fighting and feuds that result in a great amount of strain on the administration. We need to work to control these internal divisions and help workout solutions for the various clans so that they can cooperate and unite under one banner instead of fighting each other."
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch: "Curbing Tribal Politics"
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch_desc: "To transcend tribal politics is marvelous, but getting there is an entirely different story.

Every year Hindus from all walks of life travel to here to pay homage to their faith, meaning that protecting it is of the utmost importance for us. Doing so will not only grant us a good name amongst Hindu communities elsewhere, but it will also help show how devoted we are to the people of our land."
 fortifications_against_raids: "Fortifications against Raids"
 fortifications_against_raids_desc: "Raids from the north are common enough to warrant special attention from the Kutchi administration. For too long we have suffered at the hands of the Sindhi people at the mouth of the Indus River, we must not let their raids beat our people down forever. By expanding our curent and future fortifications with extra garrisons and more effective construction techniques, we can put up a much stronger fight against these fiends."

 patrons_of_ashapura_mata_desc: "She is the principle deity of our land, the land of Kutch and all of the Gujarati region surrounding it. Ashapura Mata (sometimes known as Kuldevi) is the one we must pay special attention to and whose temples we must be the largest patrons of. Doing so will earn us good favor with our own people both of high and low status, for most if not all the people of Kutch and Gujarat uphold the rulers who put their trust in the goddess who fulfills wishes and desires."

While some are skeptical as to how profitable such endeavors would be in our land, we can easily see that in the coming decades, such products will be highly sought after. We would do well to capitalize on this glass and ceramic idea now before it is too late."
 maritime_ambitions: "Maritime Ambitions of Kutch"
 maritime_ambitions_desc: "The last avenue many see for Kutch is the aspect of maritime trade and connections.

We of Junagadh have not had luck in fighting them off and as such have served as their subject in the past.

For so long we have fought against the Chaulukya kings of Gujarat and though they may be gone, new conflicts sparked as soon as the Muslims made their way to power.

 controlling_saurashtra_desc: "The nature of Saurashtra has been divided for a great many years. Few if any have ever united for long and even when they did, it was still rife with communal or tribal feuds that often hindered the productivity of the land itself. Control, then, must not come from outside the region, but rather from inside the region itself, and who better than those of Palitana? Under our guidance, we can ensure a righteous and profitable future for the strategically situated cities through the region."

 armored_cavalry_warfare_desc: "What is different about our cavalry compared to those of the Nupe or the Dahomey is that we choose to use armor for our horses.

Disputes were had and several changes had to be made to our administration and military sectors, but in the end it was all worth it, was it not?

Our heir is chosen by the Oyo Mesi which in it of itself is a council comprised of seven prinipal figures. This council is an electoral one at that and is led by the Bashorun (essentially the Prime Minister) and each of the seven position in the Oyo Mesi represent the various interests of the Oyo Empire itself.

If we can attract merchants to our coasts like the Sunda Kingdom has in the past, then we will surely prosper in these changing times."
 construct_the_pakungwati_palace: "The Pakungwati Palace"
 construct_the_pakungwati_palace_desc: "A magnificent palace for the sultans of Cirebon is what will help display brilliance and authority to the various people of our land. We can start from the thatch huts we have in conjunction with the 'tajug' pavillion called Jalagrahan, slowly expanding outward to build up a palace unlike those of any other power in Java."
 muslim_hindu_tension: "Muslim-Hindu Tensions"
 muslim_hindu_tension_desc: "We broke away from the Sunda Kingdom and its waning power, but it was not without its controversy. To this day we are still dealing with intermittent fallout from this breaking away and it has given way to a variety of tensions between Muslim and Hindu communities, but we must not capitulate to these minor factors. Cirebon must overcome these challenges and secure itself against powers who want to exploit this tension."
 dawah_efforts: "Dawah Efforts"
 dawah_efforts_desc: "Engaging in 'dawah' for others, or, inviting them into Islam is something that we have done since our early days as a sultanate. Key to our foundation as it is, we shall not stop in our efforts to spread Islam into the various places that Cirebon takes interest in. Whether it is by soldiers of our state or merchants from our coasts, Islam must flow outward from the bastion that is Cirebon."
 far_reaching_diplomacy: "Diplmatic Ties Abroad"
 far_reaching_diplomacy_desc: "If even the mighty Chinese are willing to engage in diplomatic relations with Cirebon, who would be so foolish as to refuse our hand in diplomacy? Hopefully very few since we can make lucrative and interesting deals with almost any state and people group out there in the world."
 recruit_into_the_ulama: "Recruit for the Ulema"
 recruit_into_the_ulama_desc: "For Islam, the Ulema are the scholars who study Islamic law, tradition, theology, philosophy, and ethics in-depth so that they may teach others and spread Islam in the process. They are a key aspect of Cirebon and their numbers must be increased if Cirebon is to continue to be a center of Islam in Java and elsewhere."
 center_of_islam_and_trade: "Center of Islam and Trade"
 center_of_islam_and_trade_desc: "As we grow and make our way throughout the world, we must always remember where our roots are: in Islam, and in trade. The two forces combined are effective in unifying as well as strengthening states of various kinds, Cirebon being only one example of many others. As we sail forth into the future, we will carry on our work under Allah and from coast to coast, no matter the land or the people we meet."

 from_the_fall_of_majapahit: "From the Fall of Majapahit"
 from_the_fall_of_majapahit_desc: "The fall of the once great empire of Majapahit shook Java to the very core. We of Demak know this better than other small states on Java since we are partially connected to Majapahit, even in its dying breaths. We must not let their legacy go to waste and we must not let the opportunity to consolidate Javanese land pass us by."
 successor_to_majapahit: "Successor to Majapahit"
 successor_to_majapahit_desc: "The once great empire towered over the lands of Nusantara. Stretching from Java to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra and even parts of Borneo, it has truly left an impression upon all states that succeeded it. Demak must follow the path that Majapahit did in some capacity so that it may grow to become the hegemon of the islands; conquest is the main measure by which we can fulfill Majapahit's legacy for now."
 consolidate_control_over_the_coasts: "Consolidation of Coasts"
 consolidate_control_over_the_coasts_desc: "The lucrative coastal settlements along Java are home to a wide variety of merchants from the west, but they are still lacking in a central authority to answer to. We of Demak are keen on integrating these coastal ports and docks into our state and doing so will help strengthen our naval sector immensely. Javanese sailors and ships can and will be the envy of the world!"
 campaigns_in_sumatra: "The Sumatra & Malaya Campaigns"
 campaigns_in_sumatra_desc: "To our north lay the tough and ruthless states that succeeded Srivijaya and the Majapahit Empire. Let us take to the high seas and narrow straits where many fates will be decided, for the successor states will have no mercy on us when the campaigns for trade hegemony begin."
 contesting_spice_trade_control: "Contest for the Spice Trade"
 contesting_spice_trade_control_desc: "The spice trade is lucrative to all in Nusantara and all still strive to claim it entirely, but few have the capability to make their ambition a reality. Do we of Demak have the capability? A laughable question since of course we do! We just need to prove ourselves to those who would dare question our authority."
 thalassocracy_from_java: "Thalassocracy from Java"
 thalassocracy_from_java_desc: "Keeping control of the spice trade means keeping naval control of the trade routes that go into and out of Nusantara. It isn't easy maintaining such a hefty fleet of ships, but Demak and its people are by now used to being a naval power. Let none stand in our way when it comes to keeping the waters safe and lucrative."
 modern_trade_competition: "Modern Trade Competition"
 modern_trade_competition_desc: "As the world continues to change, Demak must change along wit hit. Trade resources as well as the ways of trading as a whole are moving and shifting without end, meaning that Demak has to learn to adapt and modernize its efforts as time goes on."

 destroyers_of_the_pajang_kingdom: "Destroyers of the Pajang Kingdom"
 destroyers_of_the_pajang_kingdom_desc: "The Pajang Kingdom came before us and they were not fit to hold the seat of power in Java. Vulnerable to civil conflicts and political disputes, we of Mataram rose up from the splits in their political structure and founded a new state, one that can effectively rule Java unlike any other."
 to_subjugate_java: "Subjugating Java"
 to_subjugate_java_desc: "Java itself is a land of great riches, but Mataram's inland home is not ripe for taking hold of the edges of the grand island. Our slow but sure progress on the island will be marked with celebrations and a restructuring of the old societal ways so that they can be revamped into something more suitable for Mataram."
 learning_inland_fighting: "Learning Inland Fighting"
 learning_inland_fighting_desc: "The lands of Java are harsh for making military movements and sieges. They require hefty planning and can often take a larger toll on the military than one might expect. It is because of this that we of Mataram need to learn how to effectively conduct war on Java so that when we invade elsewhere, we can use what we learned before and thus gain an advantage."
 cut_down_unruly_subjects: "Cut Down Internal Threats"
 cut_down_unruly_subjects_desc: "Time and time again, powers on Java have been undermined by the fact that internal politics fluctuate to a great degree. Various marriages, weak authority, and people supporting pretenders to the throne have dealt deathly blows to previous powers on Java, but Mataram will be different! It will seek to tackle these threats before they can get time to flourish!"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority: "Mataram Absolutism"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority_desc: "Unlike our predecessors, we will ensure that our authority is known throughout all of our lands. Java is a land that will chew up and spit out weak states without mercy; Mataram must prove itself worthy to be spared from this fate through thorough administrative reforms and absolute authority from the monarch."
 holy_wars_of_mataram: "Holy Wars of Mataram"
 holy_wars_of_mataram_desc: "Hindus and Christians alike, they seek to claim the lands around us when in fact, they are rightfully belonging to the most powerful state on Java, that being Mataram! They know no discipline or respect for us in the slightest, not even for Islam, and for that they must die!"
 the_imogiri_burial_place: "Imogiri"
 the_imogiri_burial_place_desc: "A place to remember our past rulers, great and small, that is what Imogiri is and forever shall be. No ruler of Mataram will be placed elsewhere and as our lineage continues to grow and prosper, the complex of Imogiri will be expanded steadily. All of our past shall be looked after with care, all of the bad times as well as all of the good times."

 black_pepper_trading: "Pepper Trading"
 black_pepper_trading_desc: "A great source of the wealth made in the southern parts of Sumatra and the western parts of Java is the trade in pepper spices. We are renowned for the cultivation and export of peppers of many kinds and it would be foolish of us to not capitalize on this fact. From here, we can start delving into other key resources for trade and profit."
 resist_and_overcome_sunda: "Against Sunda"
 resist_and_overcome_sunda_desc: "The Sunda Kingdom once held influence across a majority of Western Java, but times are changing and their influence is crumbling with each week and month that passes by. We of Banten are no longer bound to the words and decrees of Sunda, instead we will forge a new path for ourselves and eclipse the once mighty Sunda Kingdom. Through blood, iron, pen, and papers, we will take what they once held as their own and make it even better."
 entrepot_for_traders: "Entrepot for Traders"
 entrepot_for_traders_desc: "With our growing influence in Sumatra and Java, it should come as no surprise that we are becoming more and more attractive to traders from very far away. Ensuring that our ports are safe and that our merchants are well educated will make a great amount of difference when we compare our trade power to others on the world stage."
 contention_in_sumatra_and_java: "Tensions in Sumatra and Java"
 contention_in_sumatra_and_java_desc: "The Sunda Kingdom may be a shadow, dying a slow death, but that does not mean peace can be had in Java or Sumatra. Indeed there are states of both Muslim and Hindu adherence that could be a threat to Banten's power, thus requiring us to take power away from them either by diplomacy or by force."
 dealing_with_the_banten_court: "Dealing with our Court"
 dealing_with_the_banten_court_desc: "Much like other states in the islands of Nusantara, Banten must deal with its own set of problems. The court of Banten is where our problems currently are since it is both an attractive and lucrative place. Corrupt connections are rife in certain sectors, meaning we will need to crack down on the corruption and scandals before they can grow to destabilize the entirety of Banten."
 divided_land_to_administrate: "Divide and Administrate"
 divided_land_to_administrate_desc: "The land of Banten is not without its struggles in terms of being able to administrate it. Petty local lords and authorities often seek to gain power in one way or another that is not always the most honest or proper, causing tension amongst various people in our administration. To counter this, we need to be appointing people of our own choosing more often, people who we know can do a good job and who are also loyal to Banten as a whole."
 protectionism_in_force: "Protect and Profit"
 protectionism_in_force_desc: "Like other states in our region have done in the past, we must now turn to the waters to secure our trade. Ship-to-ship warfare is going to only increase as time goes on and the navy of Banten must be ready for whatever hostile fleet comes into its own waters. Heavier and more robust ship designs that can load more cannons overall will certainly be a benefit to us."
 BLM_ideas: "Blambangan Ideas"
 BLM_ideas_start: "Blambangan Traditions"
 BLM_ideas_bonus:  "Blambangan Ambition"
 alongside_majapahit: "Alongside Majapahit"
 alongside_majapahit_desc: "Our roots lay in the foundations of the Majapahit Empire and its founder, Raden Wijaya, in the late 1290s. Our land was seen as a vassal of sorts to the core of Majapahit and it developed steadily alongside the heart of the once great empire. It is through this development and showing of strength with little in the way of actual help of Majapahit that Blambangan shall thrive; we are in no need of being as subject once more."
 remember_the_paregreg_war: "Memories of the Paregreg War"
 remember_the_paregreg_war_desc: "The Paregreg War of 1404-1406 was a civil war within the Majaphit Empire that was mainly over the rivalry between the courts of Majapahit (Western Court, led by Wikramawardhana) and Blambangan (Eastern Court, led by Bhre Wirabhumi). It shows just how influential and powerful the area of Blambangan had become, and though we lost back then to the Majapahit Empire, the memory of this period in history brings a sense of legitimacy to the administration of Blambangan today."
 lonely_hindu_kingdom: "The Lonley Hindu Kingdom"
 lonely_hindu_kingdom_desc: "With the loss of Majapahit and the decline of the Sunda Kingdom, Blambangan is one of the only Hindu states left on Java. In our lonesome state, we face threats from all directions since they would see the last vestige of the Majapahit Empire taken over and executed out of existence. Let us set up tall walls, defensive positions, and effective strategies to counter these invasive plans so that Blambangan can withstand these threats. We will not fall to what lies beyond our own coast."
 fending_off_foreign_interests: "Fending off Foreigners"
 fending_off_foreign_interests_desc: "The foreign forces that seek to control Java for themselves are seeking to stifle our power and our prosperity in every way possible. Our military must be ready for when our navy cannot hold them back; they must be able to outlast the enemy in battle and win fight after fight for Blambangan when defeat seems likely."
 expel_muslim_insurgents: "Expel the Muslim Insurgents"
 expel_muslim_insurgents_desc: "With the rise of Islam in the west on Sumatra and in the Malay Peninsula, Java seems to be the only bastion of Hinduism left in the main chain of islands. The states to our west are seeking to convert our people and snuff out the lasting legacy of Hinduism in Blambangan, but we shall not let them! We must ensure that our administration is strictly Hindu in most if not all aspects. If this means empowering the Brahmins to help us in this effort, then it is a price we must pay."
 centralize_trading_authority: "Centralizing Trade"
 centralize_trading_authority_desc: "Trade in Java has routinely been decentralized thanks to the internal nature of the island itself. By looking toward new methods of land cultivation and building inland roads as well as renewed infrasture, we can make sure trade is much more centralized and efficient through Blambangan."
 restore_javanese_peace: "Restoration of Java"
 restore_javanese_peace_desc: "For decades now, Java has not known peace. The wars of religion between Hindus and Muslims has caused a great amount of strife alongside conflicts with foreigners from far off shores. In time, when we restore Java to its original state with Hinduism being the prime religion of the land, the prosperity garnered here will be echoed throughout the ages in one unified tone."

 candi_shrines_of_bali_desc: "The Candi Shrines of Bali that are cut into rock are dedicated to a single deity and are used as temples throughout our land. They are a signature element of Balinese architecture and design and will continue to be paramount in the spreading of our traditions beyond just our central island."
 links_with_china: "Links with China"
 links_with_china_desc: "In our past, we have historically had intermarriages with people of various Chinese courts. These influential ties may have withered away somewhat since our past, but we can easily rekindle them and ensure that our reputation is bolstered by the fact that the Chinese see us as worthy enough to marry and do business with."
 inheritor_of_majapahit: "Inheritor of Majapahit"
 inheritor_of_majapahit_desc: "As Majapahit fell to internal conflicts and various outside influences, the court steadily moved resources and people over to Bali as it was a much safer place than Blambangan or the western parts of Java. Such a close relationship with Majapahit has resulted in many seeing us as the heir to the empire and its lands, something we should capitalize on as quickly as possible."
 javanese_court_culture: "Javanese Court Culture"
 javanese_court_culture_desc: "Majapahit influence extended not just to the society of Bali, but also to its courtly culture as well. From the details in the palace to the way in which advisors and rulers conducted themselves, much has been learned from Majapahit in the way of statecraft. Bali will undoubtedly benefit from this influence as it continues to strive for greatness."
 royal_libraries_for_manuscripts: "Royal Libraries"
 royal_libraries_for_manuscripts_desc: "Along with courtly culture, Majapahit officials and scholars brought with them various manuscripts that were revered by many. To safely store them, there should be a royal library (more than one, possibly) built so that our ruler and the administrative cadre can read upon the past in a whole and complete manner. In time, as new works are written in the coming years, they will be stored in our royal libraries."
 bastion_of_indojavanese_culture: "Bastion of Javanese Culture"
 bastion_of_indojavanese_culture_desc: "With Islam making its presence more and more known throughout the great islands of our home region, it is only natural the people who are staunchly in support of the original Hindu-Buddhist Javanese culture would fight back or, if they cannot fight back, move elsewhere. Bali has become a new refuge and home for Javanese culture as a result of this slow migration and it is through this recognition of our rising status that we will bring back the grand days of the past, before Islam made its way into our lands."
 restoration_of_the_true_javanese: "Restoration of the Javanese"
 restoration_of_the_true_javanese_desc: "Restoring the likes of the Javanese to their once grand prominence will not be easy. Bali is going to have to sacrifice a great many things in order to see the likes of Majapahit's influence achieved once again, but in the end, we know that it will be worth the effort."

 unify_south_kalimantan_desc: "We hail from the area known as South Kalimantan. Though Hindu kingdoms have come before us in the area, we are the first Islamic state in the area and with this status we must be ready to unify the island like never before. Where previous states in our area were troubled by internal struggles, we will learn from their mistakes and proclaim a stronger and more centralized state."
 ties_to_java: "Ties to Java"
 ties_to_java_desc: "Part of our population hail directly from Java and Javanese culture has permiated throughout the various communities of Banjar for decades now. We would be wise to capitalize on our partial Javanese heritage and do as they do: build up a strong and robust naval force that is capable of securing our coastal land. In time, this will help cement Banjar as a true force to be feared on this island and the many others in the Nusantara."
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara: "Migratory Ties"
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara_desc: "The Banjar people are not bound to just Banjar Sultanate alone, not at all. Migration occurs and Banjar merchants travel abroad to various communities where they sometimes settle down in, spreading our influence in foreign lands. By using these various pockets of Banjar people in diplomatic matters, we can better proclaim our right to lands outside of Borneo itself."
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people: "Equals with the Dayak People"
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people_desc: "The Dayak people are the indigenous people of South Kalimantan and though they are not Muslims like the majority of Banjar people are, the Dayaks are equal to our own. We must learn to respect and cooperate with them since they make up a good portion of our core population; doing so can help us learn to control internal matters to a greater degree in the future."
 repel_the_javanese: "Repel Coastal Invasions"
 repel_the_javanese_desc: "It is from the coast that we will find many invasions coming for us. Banjar has several lucrative trade ports that people from Java, Sumatra, and Makassar value, so defending them through refined strategies inland in conjunction with well-built ships will be crucial to our survival."
 trade_with_makassar: "Trade with Makassar"
 trade_with_makassar_desc: "Makassar is the closest island to Borneo and has been a great trade partner of Banjar for ages now. We trade in not only foods and spices, but also in cultural aspects as well, meaning that the populations of both islands are ready to cooperate with each other when necessary."
 securing_bornean_tributaries: "Secure Tributary States"
 securing_bornean_tributaries_desc: "Banjar's starting position had several tributary states in place with Banjarmasin being the central point in which authority was held. Though we are more centralized than our past, we still need a steady stream of tributary states to exert our influence outward toward different lands and islands. The number of internal tributaries paying orderly tribute will serve as an example to foreigners who wish to be apart of our system."

It is with his leadership and experience in the field of battle as general under the Ming Dynasty that we march forth against those who would oppose our authority."
 intimate_knowledge_of_china: "Intimate Knowledge of China"
 intimate_knowledge_of_china_desc: "Because of Wu Sangui's experience that he brought with him, the people in the Zhou administration have extensive knowledge of China's layout, its major roads, its major cities, just about everything there is to know for now. Going forth, we should use this knowledge to our advantage when dealing with both warring states in China and also those who want to strike up deals with us in the future."

 consolidate_the_southwest: "Consolidate the Southwest"
 consolidate_the_southwest_desc: "The hilly and tropical terrain of Southwest China has historically been hard to control because of the various tribes and clans that live here. The Yi and Miao may be the largest cultural groups, but many other smaller minorites exist that we will need to accomadate in some manner if we ever seek to consolidate true authority in the region."
 reinforce_supply_routes: "Reinforce Supply Routes"
 reinforce_supply_routes_desc: "What our home region has taught us is that supply routes are absolutely crucial to fielding any sort of military force. Proper depots, ammunition storage, food reserves, everything that encompasses 'logistics' needs to be taken care of to the greatest possible degree in Zhou for future campaigns."
 suppress_tribal_sentiment: "Suppress Tribal Sentiment"
 suppress_tribal_sentiment_desc: "The tribes and clans of the southwest, though pacified to a degree, are not always happy with our administration or they have disputes of there own that boil over into great bouts of conflict inside our own territory. We must mediate and suppress these rebellious sentiment through both civil means, and military means if things eventually come to that."

 consolidate_sumtatran_land_desc: "After the destruction of the Pasai Sultanate, much of the northern lands in Sumatra were left in disarray as Hindus and Muslims strived to reclaim what unity there was before. Being one of the contenders here, we shall proclaim ourselves as the true successors to Pasai and use Islam to gain the upper hand in the land. Unification will not come easily and we will need an effective army to battle our foes in every direction."
 strait_combat: "Strait Combat"
 strait_combat_desc: "The Strait of Malacca is where a great amount of trade flows through, meaning that there is a great amount of profit to be made if one is to control the entire thing. To help extend our own control over the lucrative region, we should be arming our merchant vessels more heavily so that they can do battle with whoever they encounter."
 wider_muslim_world_support: "Support from Western Muslims"
 wider_muslim_world_support_desc: "With new technology and faster communication via faster ships, we are coming into contact with Muslims from Arabia and Persia at an increasing rate. Many people travel to Aceh and from Aceh to explore the worlds of east and west, meaning that both sides are attracting a great amount of traders and scholars. By cultivating this positive maritime trade of ideas and people, Aceh will become a true entrepot for Sumatra and more."
 modernize_acehnese_firearms: "Modernize Acehnese Weapons"
 modernize_acehnese_firearms_desc: "To fight in these changing times is to fight with modern weaponry in the form of better cannons and better muskets. Swords and spears have their place at times, but Acehnese troops and sailors will need to become proficient in wielding gunpowder weapons if they wish to stand a chance against our foes."
 successor_to_pasai: "Successor to Pasai"
 successor_to_pasai_desc: "As we grow in strength and prosperity, it is becoming greatly evident that we are the only true successor to the Pasai Sultanate. Through fires of war and the blood spilled in feuds, Aceh's sultans and viziers are promoting what the Pasai Sultanate strived for. Let us not let our ancestors down, and let us march forth into the future with glory and honor."
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra: "Islamic Bastion of Sumatra"
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra_desc: "Much like how the Pasai Sultanate was a bastion of Islam for Sumatra, we are as well. Unlike those of Pasai though, we can take to spreading Islam due to having the foundations of the faith firmly established. Along with this, Islamic scholars from the west can surely help us out in this endeavor as well."

 the_looming_hostage_crisis_desc: "What we have been doing when we conquer territory is that, we take a portion of the people from the cities back to our own territory as hostages, using them as we please for labor or other matters. This can and will lead to increased strife within Aceh since these people will become so numerous that they will eventually want to revolt. We must put a stop to this practice now and institute new practices when we conquer land; we would rather not set ourselves up for disaster in the decades to come."

 cultivate_iron_production: "Cultivate Iron Production"
 cultivate_iron_production_desc: "For a very long time now, we have taken iron deposits from inland and brought them closer to the coast and smelted them down into various tools and weapons. These tools and weapons are what have helped us thrive so far, letting Luwu become an influential political entity that likes of which Sulawesi has rarely seen."
 key_trade_links_in_nusantara: "Key Trade Links"
 key_trade_links_in_nusantara_desc: "All throughout the Nusantara, there are polities that trade with the various island chains for various resources. Sulawesi is well within this exchange though it is not the most politically unified at times due to a variety of factors, it still manages to be an entrepot for several merchants from both inside Nusantara and outside of it."
 fighting_through_the_jungle: "Fighting through the Tropics"
 fighting_through_the_jungle_desc: "The tropical nature of Sulawesi means military movements are tough for all troops involved. Having no knowledge of the terrain can easily lead to disaster, but Luwu is the exact opposite in this regard. Connections to inland polities and people groups has allowed us to cultivate a system of directional navigation through tough terrain that we can use not only on Sulawesi, but on other islands too."

 those_who_defend_desc: "And when a foreign invader attempts to invade the lands of Sulawesi, or any other land we control, what will they encounter? A myriad of traps and obstacles on top of natural defenses that nature itself has provided. The people of Sulawesi are well versed in defensive types of warfare thanks to the terrain of the island chain; few if any can match the tenacity that they provide in this defensive regard."
 buginese_cooperation_with_natives: "Learning to Cooperate"
 buginese_cooperation_with_natives_desc: "Our core people, the Buginese people, are actually migrants to Sulawesi. The island chain is the home of the Buginese people now, but the indigenous people need to be treated with respect and care if Luwu is to be stable and prosperous. Whatever path we take in the future, we will be in harmony with our people groups, whether they come from Sulawesi itself or from outside of our core islands."
 gunpowder_rise: "Gunpowder Influx"
 gunpowder_rise_desc: "With gunpowder weapons being more readily available throughout Nusantara as the decades have gone by, we of Sulawesi cannot afford to be stagnant in our ways. There are states that would threaten us from all directions and indeed they use gunpowder to a degree that we would not be able to stand up to them if they invaded us. Modernization efforts need to be put in place for all of our military troops and sailors, no matter the cost."
 structure_luwu_society: "Structuring Luwu Society"
 structure_luwu_society_desc: "Luwu society has been relatively fluid and somewhat tribal for a long while, but increasingly this is becoming hard to manage as time goes on. Populations are increasing rapidly and we cannot maintain tribal ties that undermine the Luwu administration. Structuring society over time to fit a more rigid model that does away with most if not all tribal ties can help Luwu prosper and make it a much more powerful trader throughout Nusantara."

Though their time has long since passed by and the Javanese are off doing their own thing, Makassar has taken in the influence of Majapahit to a degree and benefited because of it. What they used to prosper we should use as well, and it starts with cultivating where our people dwell in: the cities and towns."

 centralize_sulawesi_power_desc: "To coincide with the rise of Makassarese influence around Sulawesi, it is natural that centralizing power is also needed alongside this. Codifying laws, formalizing our writing system, and ensuring that court of laws are established in various places will be necessary to making sure that Makassar is well governed at all times."

 BTN_ideas_bonus: "Buton Ambition"
 consolidate_the_island_chain: "Consolidation of the Island Chain"
 consolidate_the_island_chain_desc: "The home island chain in which we are situated can become disunited at times because of, well, geography at the very heart of things. We need to make sure that we have an effective system of authority throughout all of the islands and that we are ready to enforce this authority through a variety of means. A heart split into pieces is no heart at all, that is a fact."
 coastal_defense: "Coastal Defenses"
 coastal_defense_desc: "Living so near the coast at all times, Buton and its people are in need of a great many defensive structures as it is. On top of this, Buton's own ships need to be ready for whatever comes their way, which is where training the sailors comes into play."
 ship_building_sector: "Harbors and Docks"
 ship_building_sector_desc: "With how Buton is situated, it is in a very suitable location for building ships of various sizes, that is if we have the harbors and docks to actually build them in. By promoting the construction of coastal structures and learning how to build them more efficiently, we can speed up our rate of ship production greatly."
 enforce_political_cohesion: "Enforce Political Cohesion"
 enforce_political_cohesion_desc: "When worse comes to worse in Buton, our navy working with our army will be what secures us political power legitimacy. Dissent in the islands and across Sulawesi will not be tolerated; force will be used if necessary to bring stability and cohesion to Buton and its territories."
 JOL_ideas: "Jolof Ideas"
 JOL_ideas_start: "Jolof Traditions"
 JOL_ideas_bonus: "Jolof Ambition"
 jolof_societal_structure: "Jolof Societal Structure"
 jolof_societal_structure_desc: "There is a strict system of social classes throughout Jolof and its tributary states. There are various royal classes, non-royal nobility, free men of the land, people who work in various castes, and then finally slaves. Along with this, griots are important for telling the ancestral tales and history of Jolof, so they occupt a social class all unto themselves. This hierarchy of social classes must be retained throughout Jolof if it is to be a stable state, with reformations only happening once we are sure we are ready."
 animism_with_islam: "Traditions, and Islam"
 animism_with_islam_desc: "Islam was brought unto us from the east by people from the Mali Empire but it has not taken root as it has further to the east and north. In Jolof, some of the nobles of our land mix Islam with our native traditions, but still the majority of our people embrace that which is from our traditions. The more we can embrace parts of Islam in conjunction with our own traditional beliefs, the better off we will be as a whole."
 the_queen_mother: "The Queen Mother"
 the_queen_mother_desc: "The 'linger', or, Queen Mother, of Jolof is the head of all women in Jolof and it is she who has some of the most influence over politics in general. The position of Queen Mother grants the women her own vullages, cultivated farms that pay tribute to her directly, and the right to judge cases involving women specifically. Such a position shall be revered throughout Jolof's entirety and never be done away with."
 tributary_kingdom_system: "Tributary Kingdoms"
 tributary_kingdom_system_desc: "Jolof at its core has been made up of tributary states leading back to a central authority. Jolof historically has been landlocked and the coastal states it presided over paid tribute to the central authority that is Jolof; we should be adjusting this tributary state method of governance as times goes on so we can still exact tribute and funds from our subjects but also govern them in a proper manner."
 elected_head_of_state: "Election of the 'Bour ba'"
 elected_head_of_state_desc: "The election of the ruler (called the 'Bour ba') is done by a college of electors from the respective tributary states. Those tributary states have their rulers elected from the nobility, and those state rulers come together to elect the ruler of Jolof as a whole. This system of governance has a tendency to be abused by our tributaries, but we can use force if need be to help reform and adjust this system to a more regulated and cogent system."
 balance_out_coastal_trade: "Balancing out Coastal Trade"
 balance_out_coastal_trade_desc: "Because of developments beyond our control, there is an imbalance in the areas of Jolof. Coastal areas are becoming more wealthy than inland areas due to the rise in international trade and this is having a troubling effect on Jolof itself. To remedy this, we must setup roads and communication networks of some form so that Jolof is less landlocked and more easily able to access the coast from its tributary states. If all goes well, trade potential and wealth distribution will equal out over time."
 an_empire_unto_jolof: "A Future for Ourselves"
 an_empire_unto_jolof_desc: "With administrative matters being sorted and diplomacy through trade being conducted effectively, Jolof must turn to its military so that it can keep up its own strength. Becoming a true empire requires conquest, proper defense, and most of all, an organized military. By incorporating our tributaries into this military system, Jolof can proclaim a more unified military than other empires in West Africa's past."

 KBU_ideas_bonus: "Kaabu Ambition"
 malian_legacy: "Mali's Legacy"
 malian_legacy_desc: "We were on the fringes of the Mali Empire at its height though we did feel the effects of the political and military organization that Mali spread outward. We of Kaabu being a claimant of Mali's legacy should not discard these foundational elements that the Mali Empire left behind. Instead, we will build upon it and create a lasting empire that is a true successor to the once mighty 'Manden Kurufaba'."
 warrior_elites_of_kansala: "Warrior Elites of Kansala"
 warrior_elites_of_kansala_desc: "The heart of our people is at Kansala and it is there that a great many warriors gather regularly not only to serve Kaabu but also to refine their tactics through field training. Granted we have to make sure this training does not turn into a bloody competition between the highest ranking warriors, Kansala's warrior elites do serve to embed a militaristic marking on all of Kaabu."
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans: "The Koring and Nyancho Clans"
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans_desc: "The two head clans of Kaabu are that of the Koring and the Nyancho and they are both very militaristic in nature. They make their money and reputation off of warfare that involves Kaabu and as such help manage most of the Kaabu military. Though the degree of effective military management can vary at times, the military councils they hold and the way in which they take to logistical matters is nothing short of impressive for all of West Africa."
 malian_cavalry_legacy: "Malian Military Organization"
 malian_cavalry_legacy_desc: "Capitalizing more on how Mali organized its military, cavalry tactics is something that we should naturally focus on since the cavalry culture from the Mali Empire still permeates throughout Kaabu. Using various weapons on horseback and building our strategies around what our cavalry can do is what will aid us best in the future."
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers: "Roots as an Outpost"
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers_desc: "Originally, Kansala and the area that is core to Kaabu was just a military outpost established by the Mali Empire. Over the decades though, it has evolved into a center of culture and military might that must be defended at any cost. Since Kaabu's inception, we have relied more on offense over defense, but seeing as Kansala is becoming more and more central to our administration and military, and our trade depots are increasingly valued by a number of different groups, we need to properly fortify what we currently hold with walls and garrisons."
 importation_of_musket_weaponry: "Importing Gunpowder Weapons"
 importation_of_musket_weaponry_desc: "With trade along our coast increasing as time goes on, the weapons we are getting from trade are becoming more and more useful as time goes on. Though traditional weapons are doing us well, gunpowder weapons are making a large impact on Kaabu's military potential, especially when dealing with less organized tribes inside and outside our domain. Integrating these new weapons fully into our military will undoubtedly bring us victory after victory in the ages to come."
 stop_the_muslim_advances: "The Wars of Religion"
 stop_the_muslim_advances_desc: "Religious wars are something that we do not practice regularly, but those outside of us, especially those who follow Islam and Christianity with the utmost strictness, they practice these wars of religion quite regularly. If they want to bring this strange practice to the mighty armies of Kaabu, then they will be beaten in their own game."

 FUL_ideas_bonus: "Fulani Ambition"
 violent_migrations: "Violent Migrations"
 violent_migrations_desc: "Our start was in the days of migration across West Africa, and in these days of migration we fought against settled states for every piece of land we could get. The Mali Empire tried to stop us before, but with their destruction and the rise of the Fulo state, few will avoid giving in to our demands for land and concessions."
 cavalry_of_the_fulo: "Cavalry of the Fulani"
 cavalry_of_the_fulo_desc: "To supplement our migrations from the past and to aid our military today, cavalry have been integral to the very nature of the Fulani people. Their useful nature as civilian animals for farmers and such is great, but using them for skirmishing and full on charges against enemy armies in times of war is what we will truly need them for."
 clashes_over_gold: "Clashes over Gold"
 clashes_over_gold_desc: "The valuable gold mines that the Mali Empire are what helped made it prosper like no other empire had in West Africa's history. Seizing them as the Mali Empire decays away will line the pockets of Fulani nobles and royals to the point where they, collectively, can field an army like no other in all of West Africa."
 war_over_falling_states: "Warring State Chaos"
 war_over_falling_states_desc: "The lack of a large empire in West Africa that can hold power over several areas means that warring states are common. The decaying influence of the Mali Empire has given rise to the state of West Africa that the Fulani have come upon, but they are not going to be swallowed up by the chaos surrounding them. The Fulani will tame the chaos floating about and rein them into a suitable empire."
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo: "Increasing Muslim Influences"
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo_desc: "Mali's rulers were Muslim indeed and so are the rulers of eastern states in West Africa, but what of the Fulani leaders? That will be answered at a later date, but none can deny that Muslim influence is increasing over the entire Fulani population. The Muslim influx brings with it more manpower for our military, but it will also bring questions that our administration must answer in time."
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe: "The Torodbe"
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe_desc: "They have risen from all parts of those who live in the Western Sudanese region and have been gaining slow influence all throughout the Sahel. The Fulo state is not immune to their influential teachings and several nobles are keen on listening to the words of the Torodbe leaders; they seek to eliminate the remnants of our traditional religion and even encourage jihad against others, but still not every single part of Fulo is on board with them. We cannot expel the Torodbe from our lands it seems, but maybe we can use them for good as times goes on?"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs: "Strike down Regional Chiefs"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs_desc: "In order to keep order within the wider Fulo state, we will need to deal with tribal ties that are heavily ingrained with local communities. These regional chiefs and leaders who hold sway amongst various communities far away from our capital area need to be reined in either through diplomatic means or military force and judging from our fiery past, the latter will be of no issue for us."

 KAN_ideas_bonus: "Kano Ambition"
 descended_from_bayajidda: "Descendants of Bayajidda"
 descended_from_bayajidda_desc: "Founder of the Hausa states, Bayajidda was, according to legend, a prince from Baghdad that was exiled after the city was conquered by Queen Zidam. He went west and south with a large group of warriors and eventually arrived in Borno and from here the legend begins to diverge a little depending on where one is situated. Regardless of this divergence though, all Hausa states know that they are descendants of Bayajidda and are the legitimate Hausa Bakwai."
 chiefs_of_indigo: "Chiefs of Indigo"
 chiefs_of_indigo_desc: "We of Kano and Rano are known as the 'Chiefs of Indigo'. Cotten grows in plentiful amounts in our home areas and as such, we produce a great amount of cloth and dyed clothing for other cities and states around us. Continuing this tradition into the future will ensure a prosperous and colorful future for all of Kano."
 grand_centers_of_trade: "Hausa Centers of Trade"
 grand_centers_of_trade_desc: "The Hausa states are divided along political lines at times, but one thing that they all have in common (besides heritage) is the fact that they make for great traders and merchants. Hausa trade hubs are valued by many people groups like the Kanuri, the Nupe, the Yoruba, and even the Songhai. Who is to say we can't keep this tradition going into the future?"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts: "Support Foreign Unrest"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts_desc: "On our borders, there are a number of people groups who are not content with their overlord's authority. We are working on our own situation in regards to this, but seeing as there is opportunity in supporting foreign unrest so that the borders and influence of Kano might expand, we should welcome these possibilities in the years to come."
 manage_animist_islamic_relations: "Managing Religious Relations"
 manage_animist_islamic_relations_desc: "Islam and traditional animist beliefs of the Hausa people are intermingling constantly but there is not a true consensus as to what the religion of the Hausa people should be. In an effort to appease both sides, we should attempt to tolerate both sides here and make a state that can thrive off of multiple religions interacting with each other in peace."
 center_of_muslim_scholarship: "Center of Muslim Scholarship"
 center_of_muslim_scholarship_desc: "Kano leans toward the Islamic side of matters when it comes to religion and indeed our capital city has become a center of Muslim scholarship as of late. Promoting the trade of ideas that these scholars bring through is something that Kano would greatly benefit from."
 tributary_empire_legacy: "A True Tributary Empire"
 tributary_empire_legacy_desc: "The states of the Hausa people and indeed those that surround them are fit for paying tribute to us instead of being outright conquered and forced into submission. By setting up a formal code of laws and tributary restrictions and rights for this entire matter, the Hausa people can benefit greatly."

 chiefs_of_the_caravans: "Chiefs of the Markets"
 chiefs_of_the_caravans_desc:  "The location of Katsina and Daura allows the easy control of incoming caravans for all of the Hausa people and cities. Increasing the hold over these trade routes and formalizing the system in which they trade in will make Katsina and Daura all the more prosperous, lining the pockets of Hausa nobles and merchants alike."
 expand_the_gidan_korau: "Expand the Royal Palace"
 expand_the_gidan_korau_desc: "The royal palace is named 'Gidan Korau' or, House of Korau, and it is perhaps the oldest palace in all of the lands of the Hausa people. With its prestige and wonder being well known throughout the region, we should take to expanding the palace and modernizing it as time goes on so that we can handle any administrative task that comes our way."
 hausa_style_walls: "Walls of the Hausa"
 hausa_style_walls_desc: "To help shield ourselves from incoming raids and invasions, our people and military have constructed rudimentary walls around our capital city which has caught the eye of Katsina engineers. If we can work with them and engineer stronger and more stalwart defenses with Hausa-style architecture, there will be few who can threaten the likes of any Hausa-controlled city, or, at least any Katsina-controlled city."

 chiefs_of_slaves: "Chief of Slaves"
 chiefs_of_slaves_desc: "The power we wield amongst the traditional Hausa kingdoms is that of being the slave keeper, supplying labor to the various cities of the Hausa people. Our place in the grand scheme of things is crucial to the way of life in our region and the Hausa people depend on the practice of slavery for now, and so long as they do, Zazzau will continue to provide and be the distributor of human labor."
 ambitious_zazzau: "Thirst for Conquest"
 ambitious_zazzau_desc: "The fire that burns within the heart of Zazzau is not that of hatred for others per say, but rather the fire yearns for a prosperous and unified Hausa people with the seat of governance in Zazzau itself. For far too long we have waged war with our fellow Hausa cities to no avail; there must be a person and a city to break the stalemate once and for all! If Zazzau must be that righteous giver of firey justice so that the Hausa may be united, then so it shall be."
 slow_spread_of_islam: "Islam in Zazzau"
 slow_spread_of_islam_desc: "The more we spread our influence, the more we see Islam making its way into the ranks of Zazzau's nobility, merchant class, and peasantry. Though we are not set on adopting every single principle of Islam from the very start, we are interested in what ideas it can bring to us. Perhaps we can make a more tolerant Zazzau with the influx of these Muslims?"

 HAU_ideas_bonus: "Gobir Ambition"
 chiefs_of_protection: "Chief of Protection"
 chiefs_of_protection_desc: "Our duty to the Hausa people and to our kin to the east has always been protecting the western corridor from threats. Malian and Songhai conquests have consistently knocked at the door of the Hausa people to no end, leading to bloody skirmishes that cause great strife throughout our homeland. We must never forget our task as the defenders of the Hausa people; we must always keep our military prowess a cut above the rest and keep our men in the best fighting shape possible."
 mali_and_songhai_threats: "Threats to the West"
 mali_and_songhai_threats_desc: "The border between our land and the fearsome powers to our west is often blurred and inconsistent. Whilst this makes for easy land claims for the people of Gobir, it also means that our enemies are on the same level as us in regards to how easy it is to take land. Let us meet them on the open fields of war and fight them to the very end, for Gobir fears no tribe, kingdom, or empire."
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa: "Control the Hausa Kingdoms"
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa_desc: "It is unfortunate that we cannot leave our fellow Hausa cities and states as friendly independent entities near us, for they are always in a position to be invaded from elsewhere and succumb to external threats. In order to help secure the lands of the Hausa, we must make them subservient to Gobir and ensure that they are safely within our domain."

 imperial_memory_in_administration: "Imperial Memories in Sardinia"
 imperial_memory_in_administration_desc: "The Byzantines may not be long for this world, but they did have a lasting impact on Sardinia and its governing system as a whole even after the Moorish incursion after the Byzantines had left for more pressing matters. Our governance is modeled somewhat after what the Byzantines had implemented and in keeping with it, it ensures a greater degree of trust and faithfulness in the administration as a whole."
 one_of_the_few_without_feudalism: "Feudalism? In Sardinia?"
 one_of_the_few_without_feudalism_desc: "The feudal structure that is prevalent around Europe is in many ways alien to Sardinian people. Our lands are not regarded as the personal property of the monarch, the opposite of which is apparently quite common in monarchies elsewhere in Europe. We even have national assemblies known as the 'Crown of the Realm' are still present as well, giving us a degree of democratic notion in our style of governance, but even this is not present in much of Europe. Regardless of how alien things are, we will be more ready and adaptable to change than they will ever be."
 centralize_the_judicates: "Centralize the Judicates"
 centralize_the_judicates_desc: "Sardinia, after the fall of Byzantine influence and the failure of Moorish forces, was divided into separate judicates all vying for power by allying with different foreign powers. We must stop this decentralization of power that can destabilize us from the inside out and instead cultivate a more central authority for all the judicates."
 reject_iberians_and_papists: "Rejecting Iberians and Papists"
 reject_iberians_and_papists_desc: "The Kingdom of Aragon and the Papal States have tried time and time again to capture Sardinia and impose their influence over the Sardinian peopl and they've had success in the past. We must always be working to stave off their influence and to limit their diplomatic ties within Sardinia since they are the most potent threats to our livelihood."
 institute_the_carta_de_logu: "Instititute the 'Carta de Logu'"
 institute_the_carta_de_logu_desc: "It was during 1392 that the Judicate of Arborea devised and pushed forth the 'Carta de Logu' or, Charter of the Land. Marianus IV of Arborea compiled the code and it was updated by his daughter (Eleanor of Sardinia) later on. In this code, many citizen rights were established and it even gave a fair amount of rights to women as well; we would be foolish to not implement this law code again and to update it as time goes on."
 maintain_the_corona_de_logu: "Maintain the 'Corona de Logu'"
 maintain_the_corona_de_logu_desc: "The Judicate of Arborea maintained the 'Crown of the Realm' which was in part a national assembly and also a parliament of sorts, going through legislation and being the main legal body by which laws were brought forth and passed. Instituting this body of administration once more and reforming it with necessary changes as times goes on will serve to keep Sardinia politically and administratively flexibly unlike various monarchies around us."
 arboreas_ambition_come_to_life: "The Legacy of Arborea"
 arboreas_ambition_come_to_life_desc: "Though the grave for the Judicate of Arborea is already upon the land, their legacy lives on through us and all of the Sardinian people. Uniting them into one cohesive state and ousting all others from the lands of Sardinia is something that the Judicare of Arborea wasn't able to do, but it was something they so desperately wanted. That is what we shall seek out and once it is accomplished, we will not stop there for the glory and greatness of Sardinia."
 KNG_ideas: "Kong Ideas"

 migrants_from_mali: "Migrants from Mali's Collapse"
 migrants_from_mali_desc: "Our foundations are somewhat murky and unclear, but what foundation we can know firmly is that many of our people hail from the old Mali Empire. Though not as powerful as it once was and crumbling to outside influence and internal decay, those migrants from Mali have made their home in the lands of Kong and helped it prosper ever since."
 coming_from_different_war_houses: "From Different War Houses"
 coming_from_different_war_houses_desc: "The founding people of Kong were not from one single dynasty or one single clan or war house, but rather they were from several different war houses. Their names have changed over the decades but what remains the same throughout time is the contribution to the military potential within Kong itself. Their fearsome and powerful legacy is something we strive to uphold."
 indifference_to_kong_religion: "Money over Religion"
 indifference_to_kong_religion_desc: "When people ask the leaders of Kong, 'What religion do your slaves and workers follow?', they will answer, 'It does not matter. As long as they serve us well, they may worship as they please.'. This mentality has been key in our rise to prominence and will continue to do so since we place more emphasis on money and fighting tactics as opposed to the zealous conversion of our own people."
 establish_mercantile_houses: "Establishing Mercantile Houses"
 establish_mercantile_houses_desc: "Whilst the war houses of Kong are plentiful and sometimes a bit hard to control, the increasing flow of trade through our lands means that there should be some system setup so that we can profit in a more systematic manner. Establishing mercantile houses and setting up formal places for merchants to flock to will increase our viability as a trade partner."
 money_buys_armies: "Buying the Troops Needed"
 money_buys_armies_desc: "With trade flowing throughout Kong and money flowing in at a greater rate, we can focus on procuring fine warriors from surrounding tribes and states. Mercenary contracts can help fill in the empty ranks within the Kong armies and we have plenty of money to keep them happy."
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies: "Expansive Merchant Armies"
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies_desc: "The staying power of mercenaries in Kong armies and the lucrative trade that we profit from has come to make us somewhat reliant on steady mercenary contracts. Though we certainly have our own warriors to rely on, the mercenary contracts for Kong are becoming increasingly regulated and easy to come by."
 formal_royal_houses: "Formal Royal Houses"
 formal_royal_houses_desc: "Kong's power is firm on the outside to many, but inside it is still somewhat fragile. War houses and mercantile houses are still coming into conflict with each other at times and with each new feud, our power degrades slightly. Let us try to resolve these disputes from the top-down and institute new succession laws with distinct and formal royal houses that all of Kong recognizes."

 historical_trade_center_desc: "For several decades now, Timbuktu has been a trade center unlike any other in the Sahel Region. From the north come traders from the lands of Morocco and from the west, south, and east come traders from the many plains and river systems of West Africa. Keeping Timbuktu as it is and cultivating its greatest parts can only bring more wealth and grandeur to the city and the people who live in it."
 center_for_muslim_scholars: "Center for Muslim Scholars"
 center_for_muslim_scholars_desc: "From our dusty foundation to now, Muslim scholars have flocked to Timbuktu not only because it is a city of wealth, but also because it was once part of the great Mali Empire. Though now resigned to the texts of history, Malian influence on Timbuktu helped us greatly and the gifts Muslim scholars bring to us is always appreciated."
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu: "The Three Madrasas"
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu_desc: "The Sankore, Djinguereber, and Sidi Yaha Madrasas are the three most important centers of learning inside of Timbuktu. Though centered around Islamic education, these three lucrative and grand centers of knowledge have and will continue to help propel Timbuktu into prominence both through divulging new ideas for us to take up and by attracting foreign scholars in time."
 commercial_endeavors_for_us: "Commercial Endeavors"
 commercial_endeavors_for_us_desc: "Whilst our natural progression in terms of commercial wealth is great, we could do better by ensuring that our own merchants are well protected by guards and also educated to a fair degree. The central administration of Timbuktu would be wise to perhaps fund a school of sorts dedicated entirely to training and perfecting the art of being a merchant."
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger: "Develop the Gift of the Niger"
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger_desc: "A nickname for our great city has been the 'gift of the Niger', eluding to the fact that we are one of the largest and wealthiest cities along the Niger River. We could use the wealth we gain from our grand capital to develop infrastructure in surrounding areas, especially along the Niger River, and perhaps make a second Timbuktu somewhere along the lines."
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade: "The Sahara Trade Routes"
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade_desc: "Mastering the trade routes across the Sahara is not easy, but those close to it can learn how they flow and where they regularly come through to. As Timbuktu has always been a natural stopping point for some Saharan trade routes for centuries at this point, it is only natural that we become masters of them."
 tuareg_connections: "Tuareg Connections"
 tuareg_connections_desc: "The versatile and sometimes hostile Tuareg people of the Sahara and Sahel Region swear fealty to no state for long. They are akin to mercenaries that can strike fear into the hearts of many in Timbuktu, but we can also negotiate with them for their services in protecting our trade caravans and such. It is better to be in good standing with these fearsome people than to be their consistent enemy."

 long_range_trading: "Long Range Trading"
 long_range_trading_desc: "We of Bonoman get caravans from states all across the savannah and even the Sahel Region. Lucrative is the trade we indulge in and profit lines all the pockets of our merchants and leaders. Few can resist the temptation of coming to Bonoman markets, and fewer still will leave empty-handed."
 nucleus_at_markets: "Markets are our Heart"
 nucleus_at_markets_desc: "Bonoman cities and towns are not traditionally centered around a palace or military fortress, but rather they are centered around markets where people do business and make money. Whilst strange to other people, it has served us well so far and kept us afloat financially whereas other people suffer when centered around palaces or fortifications, leaving markets to grow much more slowly."
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity: "More Iron Smelting"
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity_desc: "Though we do smelt iron ore into iron for other states and people groups around us, there are others who compete with us in this regard. We need to ensure that Bonoman states are competitive with how much iron they produce and how good the iron is in quality, for if we can outdo our neighbors in this regard, we will secure positive trade relations as well as even more wealth."
 the_akan_gold_trade: "The Akan Gold Trade"
 the_akan_gold_trade_desc: "The lucrative Akan Gold Trade is valued by many around the Bonoman states and we are an integral part of it. The once great Mali Empire even invaded our lands to claim hegemony over the Akan Gold Trade, but their influence did not last long since we asserted our own independence not long after they came through. From now into the future, let the Akan Gold Trade bring wealth and stability to those of the Bonoman states!"
 taxing_trade_routes: "Taxes from Trade"
 taxing_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come through our land are valuable in many senses, so why not formalize the taxes we impose upon them? They shouldn't be too high so that they drive away business, but they also shouldn't be too low so that the Bonoman states start suffering financially."
 bonoman_blacksmithing: "Bonoman Blacksmithing"
 bonoman_blacksmithing_desc: "Whilst our blacksmiths are used to providing arms to people groups outside of the general vicinity of the Bonoman states, perhaps we can start producing weapons more for our own people. Arming them and training them in a particular style unique to us 'Abron' people could give us a distinct advantage in the future."
 unify_the_bonoman_states: "Unify the Bonoman States"
 unify_the_bonoman_states_desc: "For far too long the Abron people have been split into decentralized states that collectively constituted the 'Bonoman nation'. Introducing a series of centralizing reforms and taking in foreign ideas that are brought to us through trade routes could have a positive effect, and it could help unify the divided states into a solid and cohesive state for the Abron people."

 DGB_ideas_bonus: "Dagbon Ambition"
 drum_chant_histories: "Drum Chants"
 drum_chant_histories_desc: "Much of the history of the Dagomba people are recorded not through writing, but through drum chants that are extensive and lengthy. They symbolize not only our people's journey throughout time but also their creativity in keeping the memories of the past preserved for future generations."
 the_king_of_strength: "The King of Strength"
 the_king_of_strength_desc: "Our king is known as the 'Ya Naa', or, 'King of Strength', which stems from the foundation of the Dagbon state itself by Sitogu. The king demonstrates not only his own strength at several times but also in his willingness to defend the Dagomba people in person and with the collective power of the Dagomba warriors."
 govern_over_the_indigenous_people: "Governing the Indigenous People"
 govern_over_the_indigenous_people_desc: "The people we have come to govern in our foundational days (like the  Konkomba, Nafeba, Basare, and the Chamba) are still around, though in a reduced set of numbers. We have come to terms with them and the Dagomba people are getting along with the indigenous groups, making for a more cohesive and productive central state."
 implement_the_surviving_tengdamba: "Utilize the Surviving Tengdamba"
 implement_the_surviving_tengdamba_desc: "The tengdamba/tengdana were earth priests who owned the land before the Dagomba people came through and conquered the indigenous people. They resisted us as one might expect and many tengdamba were killed along the way, but the remaining ones have proven to be loyal enough to us that they are being implemented as loyal local administrators and military officers."
 invest_in_islamic_matters: "Islamic Investing?"
 invest_in_islamic_matters_desc: "Islam is continuing to be a factor in our politics and societal structure, but we are still skeptical as to what to do about it on a large-scale. Investing in the syncretism between our own traditions and Islam is perhaps the best path here since the traditions of Dagbon are deeply entrenched within our people."
 centralized_political_structuring: "Centralize our Politics"
 centralized_political_structuring_desc: "Decentralized politics is keeping the Dagbomba people from making serious strides in reformation of administrative matters as well as societal traditions. Continuously we are seeing new ideas spread around us, but we are constantly being challenged by old notions of how to do things that hinder us. We need a concentrated effort to break down barriers and reform parts of the Dagbon state so that new ideas are more readily taken in by us."
 expand_at_others_expense: "Policy of Expansion"
 expand_at_others_expense_desc: "The areas around the Dagomba people's homeland are not truly safe and peaceful; there are rivals on all sides, both in the shadows and in the open sunlight. War is something we must be ready for at all times whether it is in military supplies being available or diplomats ready to negotiate a favorable peace deal."
 JIM_ideas: "Jimma Ideas"
 JIM_ideas_start: "Jimma Traditions"
 JIM_ideas_bonus: "Jimma Ambition"
 the_only_oromo_confederation: "The Only Oromo Confederation"
 the_only_oromo_confederation_desc: "We are alone, in a sense. There are no other Oromo states, it is only us in the world. Our kin may be scattered about in nearby areas and regions, but they are not independent like we are. As the beacon of hope for the Oromo people, we must rally them to our banners and show them that with enough tenacity and ferocity, a day clear of smoke and blood is possible. Let them flock to us and be part of the only Oromo confederation there is."
 abba_boku_style_administration: "The Gadaa System"
 abba_boku_style_administration_desc: "The traditional democratic method of governance utilized by us, the Oromo people, has been relatively stable and working to bring us prosperity and unity. Under the Gadaa system, every eight years the Oromo people choose by consensus nine leaders known as 'Salgan ya'ii Borana' or, 'the nine Borana assemblies. A leader elected by the Gadaa system is only in power for eight years and the election takes place at the end of that term, and if the Abbaa Gadaa dies whilst in office, the 'bokkuu' (symbol of power) passes to his wife until the end of the term."
 settle_the_oromo_feuds: "Settle the Oromo Feuds"
 settle_the_oromo_feuds_desc: "The Oromo migrations have had a debilitating affect on many people groups, including the Oromo themselves. Feuds that were once stowed away flared back up, and new disputes arose as we travelled across the land to where we are today. We must consistently work to settle these disputes and feuds or we will be ripped apart by them in time."
 the_position_of_azazi: "Utilize the Position of Azazi"
 the_position_of_azazi_desc: "The azazi (translated as 'the orderer') will be useful to us in the future, serving as one of the leaders of the administration. His position will be overseeing domestic affairs only, maintaining any and all treasuries we have, and managing finances related to the central court of Jimma itself. Such a prestigious and valuable position will attract many good people to our court, so we shall see to it that they are all vetted properly and of Oromo descent."
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers: "Professional Soldiers of the Oromo"
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers_desc: "Soldiers of our people come from all walks of life and indeed many are levied to the cause of the military without much in the way of us supplying them proper weaponry or training, but we are learning to do better from how we treat the personal guards that keep the central court and palace defended. If we can replicate their training and discipline for the likes of the common Oromo soldier, we would stand a much better chance at waging war against our neighbors."
 multi_functional_slaves: "Multi-Functional Slaves"
 multi_functional_slaves_desc: "Slaves in Jimma are not like typical slaves where they work on a plantation or in a mill day in and day out. Instead, slaves in Jimma are still of a considerably low societal clas, but they are able to serve as jailers, market judgers, stewards for the central court's territories, and many other roles. They are a valuable part of Oromo society and continuing this multi-functional role for them will help our state flourish into the future."
 affirm_oromo_might: "Affirm Oromo Might"
 affirm_oromo_might_desc: "To have survived the past was hard, but to survive the future? It could be even harder, or it could be much easier. We can't know which possibility is more likely, but we will hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Oromo people will fight to the very end to preserve the independence they fought so hard for; they will not be subjugated with ease by any surrounding power."
 JNN_ideas: "Djenné Ideas"
 JNN_ideas_start: "Djenné Traditions"
 JNN_ideas_bonus: "Djenné Ambition"
 linked_with_timbuktu: "Linked with Timbuktu"
 linked_with_timbuktu_desc: "The history of Djenné is inherently linked with the glorious trade city that is Timbuktu. We both trade in similar materials and we both have prospered because of our position near rivers. It would be wise of us to build upon this importance and develop beneficial trade relations with all of our neighbors if we are able to."
 great_mosque_of_djenne: "Great Mosque of Djenné"
 great_mosque_of_djenne_desc: "Built somewhere between 1200 and 1300 as our tradition tells us, the mosque has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship and a beacon for traders all around us. Such a symbol of piety is rarely seen in our region and Djenné is truly blessed to have such a great building in our lands. Let us go forth and engage in the great dialogue that happens between Muslims across various regions, for all of them will be welcome in our great mosque."
 salt_gold_slave_trade: "The Salt, Gold, and Slave Trade"
 salt_gold_slave_trade_desc: "Capitalizing on the trade that our friends in Timbuktu capitalize on can bring us prosperity, right? If we work hand-in-hand with them and cooperate to entice merchants from all over the region to come to our lands, there will be few who can compete with our trade endeavors."
 island_of_djenne: "The Island of Djenné"
 island_of_djenne_desc: "Every year, the Bani and Niger rivers rise begin their seasonal flooding. From July to December, Djenne becomes something of an island and the irrigation of crops around the land becomes possible once more. We rely on this annual flood to help bring us a bit of wealth, but perhaps we can invest more into agricultural techniques that can allow for more to be grown, or different and more valuable crops to be planted."
 adapt_to_changing_trade: "Adapting to Evolving Trade"
 adapt_to_changing_trade_desc: "With coastal trade from the south and west coming into view, we need to be sure that our importance does not decline. Coastal trade is much easier for people to engage in than trade across plains and savannah so we must be ready for when we get a decrease in merchant numbers. By adapting our merchants and our own way of thinking about trade to this evolution in trade in West Africa, we can still have a fighting chance in the world of trade."
 refined_adobe_architecture: "Refine our Adobe Architecture"
 refined_adobe_architecture_desc: "Many around us know Djenné for its adobe architecture. The use of mud bricks is well known throughout West Africa and it is a common building material in drier, more arid climates (such as in Djenné) since it is relatively easy to make in large numbers and quite durable in dry conditions. By refining how adobe architecture is done in Djenné, we can reinforce our buildings so that they are stronger and also streamline the process of making mud bricks in general."
 build_upon_our_wealth: "Djenné's Wealth"
 build_upon_our_wealth_desc: "Prosperity is garnered from knowledge combined with ambition and tempered by commerce, or, at least that is what some of the wealthy merchants in Djenné say. We know that it is true to a degree and we are working to invest the profit we gain from trade and taxation so that our future prospects are much brighter. New trade depots, marvelous yet functional buildings, and prestigious mosques will all be in order for Djenné in time."
 AUS_ideas: "Australian Ideas"
 AUS_ideas_start: "Australian Traditions"
 AUS_ideas_bonus: "Australian Ambition"
 the_island_continent: "The Island Continent"
 the_island_continent_desc: "Vast and expansive, this land is something almost completely alien to the likes of where we came from originally. What this expansive land lacks in natural resources inland it more than makes up for in its plentiful places for harbors and shipyards. If we are going to survive here in Australia, we need to ensure our navy and ships are well kept and maintained."
 diverse_landscape: "Diverse Landscape"
 diverse_landscape_desc: "From rolling savannah in some places to harsh desert-like landscapes elsewhere to even enjoyable grasslands in some isolated pockets, Australia is a very intriguing and multi-faceted land. If we can get a handle on the seasonal changes and which crops best in which environment, we can start producing much more for ourselves and perhaps even others for export."
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood: "Seafaring Ancestry"
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood_desc: "To get to Australia, you need to have some sort of naval heritage; it's just a simple fact of this place. As a result, we have inherited the traditions of our homeland and become somewhat keen on making seafaring a crucial part of Australia as a whole. Soldiers are in demand sometimes sure, but sailors are given the lion's share of training and funding so that we can ensure our naval prowess continues to grow unhindered."
 valued_trade_with_the_indies: "Valuable Northern Trade"
 valued_trade_with_the_indies_desc: "To our direct north are the 'Spice Islands' as some call them. The various political entities there do good business with us regularly and we value their cooperation since their spices like cloves, black pepper, and cinnamon are highly valued by the Australian people. Perhaps we can even make way into the spice trade eventually since Australia's diverse landscape could be suitable for growing certain spices."
 expansive_australian_shipyards: "Expand the Shipyards"
 expansive_australian_shipyards_desc: "As time goes forth, we are settling more of the coastline and expanding our ability to make a sustainable state on this interesting island continent, but not only this, we are slowly expanding our many harbors and shipyards for increased production measures. The naval prowess of those living all the way in the vast expanses of Australia will be truly something to marvel at."
 no_time_spent_being_idle: "No Rest for the Wicked"
 no_time_spent_being_idle_desc: "Some would call us wicked and horrid for wanting to live in such a place like Australia but we do not care for such petty insults. Instead, we care for making the land we control something we can live on with security since much of the Australian wilderness can be home to hostile animals or hostile native tribes. There is never any rest for our people, no there ain't rest for the wicked."
 master_the_australian_terrain: "Master the Outback"
 master_the_australian_terrain_desc: "Once we have mastered the Australian outback and its harsh ways, we'll be able to fend off any invader wishing to come through our lands. We'll utilize both natural and man-made defenses to stop invaders from intruding on our land, and should we be able to take positions on foreign lands across some stretch of water, we'll utilize what natural defenses are there to interrupt our enemies at every turn."
 CAM_ideas: "Central American Ideas"
 CAM_ideas_start: "Central American Traditions"
 CAM_ideas_bonus: "Central American Ambition"
 criollos: "Congress of the Criollos"
 criollos_desc: "Criollos are, to us of Central America, those of almost pure motherland descent but they were born here, and not on the far shores of what lands we once swore fealty toward. These Criollos have so far led the way in shaping how we have gained independence and we will continue to support them in their efforts to rally the populace against those who strike down at Central America's unified provinces."
 stave_off_bloodshed: "Less Bloodshed, More Unity"
 stave_off_bloodshed_desc: "Regardless of how bloody our path to indepence was, we need to stand tall and above what pools of blood are in our past. Abstaining from needless bloodshed in our administration and facilitating shared bonds of common identity is what these provinces of Central America need, not consistent tyranny and harsh treatment from petty overlords."
 liberal_minded_locals: "Liberal Minded Locals"
 liberal_minded_locals_desc: "Not only is our congress and administration liberal minded, but so are our locals to a great degree. They have taken the lessons given to them (both harshly and graciously) by our former overlords and come to develop a very unique and liberal way of thinking that few states around us can claim to have or even imitate. Whilst it may cause tenion in the future due to political debate and intrigue, we should take some of these ideas up when we can and not stunt their growth in the slightest."
 resolve_regional_disputes: "Resolving Regional Differences"
 resolve_regional_disputes_desc: "If there is one thing that has been plaguing the administration of these united provinces, it is the fact that regional differences between various communities keep rising up without end and causing endless factionalism from the ground up. If we are going to instill any sort of lasting faith in our officials and their capabilities, we need to establish more efficient and thorough laws and regulations for keeping the various communities of ours in check."
 proper_city_connections: "Proper Communication Networks"
 proper_city_connections_desc: "To better facilitate travel and communication between not only the communities of Central America, but also the different provincial offices and such, we will institute a sort of fixed road system complete with mapping and plans for a postal service. If we can do this in an effective and timely fashion, not only will civilians be able to get around and communicate faster, but our military will be able to do exactly the same and so will our own officials."
 constitutional_reforms: "Open to Reformation"
 constitutional_reforms_desc: "What would be if we were not open to change? Our former overlords refused to go along with what changes we wanted for ourselves, so now that we have the torch of independece on our side, we can and will be open to reforming our legal system and administration in whichever way we see fit."
 united_provinces_in_reality: "Truly United Provinces"
 united_provinces_in_reality_desc: "In the end, we will see to it that we stay united no matter the cost. We cannot risk being divided in the face of our former colonial masters regaining power they once had, or new colonial masters seeking viable land in Central America. When our administration from the top down is effective and efficient, all other matters will in place for the United Provinces of Central America."
 COL_ideas: "Colombian Ideas"
 COL_ideas_start: "Colombian Traditions"
 COL_ideas_bonus: "Colombian Ambition"
 history_of_previous_rebel_sentiment: "History of Rebel Sentiment"
 history_of_previous_rebel_sentiment_desc: "Since our land was colonized, we have had to deal with separtist sentiments interally. Thankfully we have become fairly ruthless and good at rooting out these rebellious sentiments and have grown to be able to make Colombia a much more stable place, or, well, a place that is safe internally."
 indigenous_assistance: "Indigenous Assistance"
 indigenous_assistance_desc: "The local people of the land are quite fierce in their fighting, though they were slowly overcome by our forces when we were still and a young colony. Now that we can utilize indigenous people in what ways we deem fit, it would be best to incorporate them into the Colombian military system in an equal fashion so that they can contribute to any and all war efforts we are in."
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives: "Balancing Liberals and Conservatives"
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives_desc: "With the coming of our independence, we have had a number of groups proposing various ideas for Colombia to go for. Liberal ideas, conservative ideas, they are all tempting but we cannot risk alienating one part of the nation if we go for one path. We must work to find a balance between both strains of thought in Colombia."
 martial_skill_from_our_parents: "Retain Martial Prowess"
 martial_skill_from_our_parents_desc: "Our former overlords were keen on one thing when they colonized this land: military prowess. It is how they were able to best the natives and subjugate the entirety of the land. If we wish to stay on top of things in Colombia and be prepared for external as well as internal threats, we need to make sure our military is prepared."
 colombian_coasts: "Colombian Coasts"
 colombian_coasts_desc: "The coasts of Colombia are places of great trade and places of various meetings between people, but they are always somewhat vulnerable due to our lack of shipyards and docks. If we can perhaps invest some more time and money into our coastline, we'll make sure that our trade hubs are much safer."
 hill_and_jungle_warfare: "Fights in Colombian Land"
 hill_and_jungle_warfare_desc: "If one is to fight in the heartlands of Colombia, one is asking to fight amidst humid rains and rough terrain. What kind of soldier is able to do such a thing for more than a little while? Why, only Colombians of course, which is why we have learned to adapt our fighting style to this kind of landscape."
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other: "In Union and Peace"
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other_desc: "If there is one thing we of Colombia strive for, it is this: To be in union and peace with each other. It certainly is a lofty goal considering how chaotic international politics can be, but we must make an effort to enforce law and order in the vast expanses of Colombia before we start reaching out to other domains for conquest or to liberate fellow colonial states."
 CAL_ideas: "Californian Ideas"
 CAL_ideas_start: "Californian Traditions"
 CAL_ideas_bonus: "Californian Ambition"
 mythical_past_of_california: "A Mythical Past"
 mythical_past_of_california_desc: "Our founders from the far off shores shared many tales of California's foundation in myths and legends. Great figures walking our landscape, wondrous and grand cities dotting the coastline and such, but reality is sadly not as grand as myths let on. Still, Californians bask in this foundation in myths and legends; it is part of what makes California, well, California."
 abundance_of_food_yearround: "An Abundance of Food"
 abundance_of_food_yearround_desc: "Without agriculture there is still a great amount of food available in California. The natives that lived in these lands before we arrived thrived off of the natural landscape itself without agriculture. If we can learn to be as resourceful as them in finding food, we can support a far greater population than what our ancestors thought was possible."
 come_to_peace_with_native_californians: "Come to Peace"
 come_to_peace_with_native_californians_desc: "Whilst we are becoming more and more numerous year after year, the native Californian tribes and people still hold a good portion of land that we should not just brush off to the side. Making peace and cooperating with them is what can make or break California altogether. If there is internal unity within our nation, few can come between us and greatness."
 the_problem_of_agriculture: "The Problem of Agriculture"
 the_problem_of_agriculture_desc: "As more and more people come to California to settle down, and as more and more Californians come into being through marriages and having children, there will be a need to develop agriculture on a large scale. Farm estates and such are going to need to be cultivated for our growing population and by starting now as opposed to later, we'll be ahead of the curve come future decades and centuries."
 tame_the_rugid_inlands: "The Rugged Californian Wilds"
 tame_the_rugid_inlands_desc: "California is a land of many shifting landscapes. From grasslands to forests to hills and deserts, we have it all to some degree and we need to learn how to master these terrain types with both civilian settlements and military soldiers. Building fortifications in crucial places of varying terrain types can help train our soldiers and also improve communication speeds all around the likes of our vast and beautiful land."
 the_advantage_of_bays: "Californian Bays"
 the_advantage_of_bays_desc: "Coasts are as important to California as gold is to global trade. We thrive off trade and through our natural harbors and bays, we'd be foolish not to! If we build up these cities that are near these natural bays and harbors, we'll be an income greater than what our former masters thought was feasible for California."
 the_gold_rush: "Gold?"
 the_gold_rush_desc: "There are interesting reports of gold deposits being found in various parts of California's interior and whilst we cannot verify most of these findings and reports, the ones we can verify can serve to attract a great many settlers and miners to our land. They'll pay as much as they need to get in and start mining for gold, so why not make money off of this influx of possible future businessmen?"
 LOU_ideas: "Lousianian Ideas"
 LOU_ideas_start: "Lousianian Traditions"
 LOU_ideas_bonus: "Lousianian Ambition"
 hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi: "Hostilities by our River"
 hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi_desc: "Whether at the river itself or nearby at its banks, we have had several hostile encounters that have trained our military to be keenly aware of how to handle the great river we reside upon. Cavalry and artillery take a less prominent role when fighting near the great river and infantry are at the heart of the fighting and it is because of this that our men are some of the most resilient in the region."
 regular_river_crossing: "Regular River Crossings"
 regular_river_crossing_desc: "Crossing the great Mississippi River is no easy task for a commander or general, but it can certainly be done with enough supplies and effort. We need to be training our future commanders to navigate river crossings both small and large with ease so that they are able to use river crossings either to their advantage or nullify the major effect it might have on a battle they're engaged in."
 starting_of_plantations: "Plantations of Louisiana"
 starting_of_plantations_desc: "Agriculture in Louisiana, especially southward toward the open sea, is hard to cultivate since marshland and swampy terrain is just not suitable for widescale farms and plantations. We need to open up tracts of land in the more hospitable areas of Louisiana and begin the construction of proper plantations and farm estates so that we can start producing food on a large scale. Perhaps in time, we'll start growing other goods too on the new plantations."
 sustainable_harbors: "Sustainable Harbors"
 sustainable_harbors_desc: "In order to have a proper navy, we are going to need suitable harbors and shipyards. This wouldn't be an issue in most other coastal places, but for Louisiana and its wetlands, we need to get creative with our harbors and shipyards. We will need to engineer some well-built structures that can be used on less-than-ideal terrain and once we obtain some good coastal lands, we need to ensure that our harbors and shipyards there are also built in a very similar fashion."
 vie_for_gulf_control: "The Battles for the Gulf"
 vie_for_gulf_control_desc: "Controlling the trade in the gulf to our immediate south is a priority of ours since a lot of our trade comes through there. If we can secure it with our own ships and fend off hostile powers, both other independent nations of the New World and old nations from beyond the ocean, we will be in a grand position to command all the trade around us."
 the_marshland_masters: "Marshland Masters"
 the_marshland_masters_desc: "What fighting we've done and what civil cultivation of the land we've done in the harsh terrain of Louisiana has trained us to be resilient and hardworking people. Our former colonial masters may think of us as little upstarts who need to get back in line eventually, but we'll show them just how wrong they are about the Louisianan people. Let them land on our shores, and let them drown in their own blood mixed with the water."
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river: "The Mississippi River"
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river_desc: "The great Mississippi River is a very defining feature of the region we reside in and it is perhaps the key defining factor about Louisiana itself. So many people depend on it for their own lives and for making money off of trade, we would be fools to try to close it down to only ourselves. We should be attracting any and all merchants that we can and invite them in so that they too can share in the glory of the mighty Mississippi River."
 LAP_ideas: "Argentine Ideas"
 LAP_ideas_start: "Argentine Traditions"
 LAP_ideas_bonus: "Argentine Ambition"
 cattle_raising_tradition: "Cattle Raising Tradition"
 cattle_raising_tradition_desc: "The lands of Argentina are not ripe for large plantations and farm estates, nor are they good for mining minerals from the earth. Instead, they are good for raising cattle and livestock, which we take a degree of pride in now that we are independent. By keeping this central facet of Argentine society going, we can sustain a growing population over the coming years."
 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director: "Establish the Office of Supreme Director"
 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director_desc: "We cannot have a single cadre of individuals holding power over the nation who are in power because of their status and wealth alone. We need an elected council of people and on top of that, someone to lead Argentina into the future. The new elections of the future shall henceforth not proclaim a 'viceroy' some colonial title, they will be the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of Argentina."
 confederation_vs_federation: "Confederation, or Federation?"
 confederation_vs_federation_desc: "Many within Argentina debate as to how the provinces should be governed from the central administrative body and roughly they fall into two categories: Unitarians and Federalists. Whether we choose the path of confederation as endorsed by the Unitarians, or a federal system as proposed by the Federalists, we will need to defend Argentina from outside threats and colonial powers attempting to snuff out the fires of Argentine liberty; in this respect, there are no shortage of fighters ready and willing to take up arms for their own independence."
 defeat_secessionits_movements: "Defeat Secessionist Movements"
 defeat_secessionits_movements_desc: "Argentina is not a uniform and neat nation that can be easily governed, not at all. There are disputes in several places that need to be mediated and settled if any progress is going to be done toward developing the nation as a whole, and those who would secede from Argentina will know no mercy from us."
 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes: "Argentine Political Landscape"
 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes_desc: "The politics of our young nation are turbulent and fiery, but what does one expect from being founded upon the fires of war against an former colonial overlord? We are going to need to look toward easing tensions between various political factions and ensuring that the governing body in Argentina is capable of handling corruption in whatever form it takes."
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries: "Suppress Counter-revolutionary Zeal"
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries_desc: "Some say it is not possible, but reality is so rarely what we want it to be. There are some who would indeed rise up against Argentina and return it to the greedy hands of our former colonial overlords. These counter-revolutionaries are some of the worst threats to Argentina and we will need to fight them off at every turn when they rise up. They lack the faith that others do in an independent Argentina; we will show they just how wrong they are."
 watch_for_caudillos: "Watch for Caudillos"
 watch_for_caudillos_desc: "Caudillos, a taboo word of sorts in our land. It stands for militarist politician who seeks to govern from the top down according to his will and those with unflinching loyalty to him. We need to watch for these abhorrent people rising up in the ranks of the Argentine administration, for if they have their way with the government, the entire dream of an independent and unified Argentina could easily collapse in on itself."

 the_enemies_within_chile: "Defeating the Royalists"
 the_enemies_within_chile_desc: "Those who cling to the power of our former colonial overlords, the Royalists as they are known as, are a consistent threat to Chile's independence. We must take a torch and burn this mold off of Chile's pride and greatness! We cannot and will not go back to the likes of our former overlords! Chile will be free!"
 the_enemies_outside_chile: "Securing against Royalists"
 the_enemies_outside_chile_desc: "Royalists are not bound to just Chile's interior, but rather they are spread far and wide beyond Chile's borders. We need to ensure that the entire nation is rallied against these oppressive people who would rather live under tyranny instead of fighting for freedom."
 chilean_finances: "Chilean Finances"
 chilean_finances_desc: "Chile has had to struggle with had financial times for a while since the lands of Chile are not blessed with great wealth like those in other parts of South America. This struggle has helped Chilean economists and financiers learn how to minimize spending and maximize profit for what little good land we have, and more importantly they have learned how to streamline military spending so that there is little in the way of wasted funds."
 establish_chilean_schooling: "To be Educated"
 establish_chilean_schooling_desc: "What our officials know better than anyone else around us is that an educated populace is a more well-off populace. Social mobility can be had more easily with education and as such Chilean schools and libraries need to be promoted whenever possible. Building new ones in our largest cities and radiating out from there will be a fine start."
 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition: "Who Needs a State Religion?"
 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition_desc: "Chile's foundation may be steeped in the fires of colonial independence movements, but Chile must also think about its future and not simply be stuck in the past. Previously we saw state religions enforced everywhere we looked, but does Chile truly need a state religion? We must be more liberal minded about this and appeal more to tolerance as opposed to tradition, for that (being more liberal minded) is what helped us gain independence in the first place."
 spearhead_liberal_ideas: "Spearheading Liberal Ideas"
 spearhead_liberal_ideas_desc: "The mindset of being liberal with many things in life is alien to many of our former overlords, but in Chile, it is widely embraced. There are some who critique us for how we think and live life what with it being much more liberal in nature as opposed to what traditions we come from, but we will greet these critiques with thought-provoking debate and discussion, not swords and weapons."
 balance_the_political_scales: "Balance the Scales"
 balance_the_political_scales_desc: "As the political landscape in Chile develops, there is a real threat that disputes in politics could erupt into civil conflicts that involve armies moving against each other. We need to attempt to balance out those with more conservative views and those with more liberal views inside the Chilean government so that they don't tear each other apart when debates rise up."

 the_gran_chaco_desc: "The Gran Chaco region of Paraguay is an interesting and productive region that can hold mixed situations for our economy. It is good for cattle raising but is only somewhat alright for farming, so we must carefully choose how to utilize its potential since its natural terrain will bolster the production of most whatever we choose to grow there."
 intermarry_and_intermix: "Befriend and Intermarry with Natives"
 intermarry_and_intermix_desc: "The others around us might see fit to fire at and cut down the native people of the land, but we of Paraguay see absolutely no need for this. They are integral to the land and were here before us; they deserve degrees of respect and dignity above that of slavery. We will ensure their protection and integration into Paraguay and our nation will be stronger because of it."
 defend_against_foreign_raids: "Foreign Raids!"
 defend_against_foreign_raids_desc: "The land of Paraguay is naturally divided by rivers part of the time, but that does not stop foreign people coming across our border and raiding villages and towns. We need to bolster our defenses and improve how many of our people are able to wield muskets properly. Native or mixed race, if they can fire a musket and swear loyalty to Paraguay's defense, we'll need them."
 native_allies_of_paraguay: "Repaid in Full"
 native_allies_of_paraguay_desc: "WIth our treatment of the native people being different to those around us, we have seen a mixed reaction in Paraguay ranging from acceptance to resistance. Regardless of this, the cooperation and intermarrying with native people has garnered us lasting and good relations with many native tribes to the point of being able to rely on them in times of war."
 reforming_the_paraguayan_economy: "Reformation of the Economy"
 reforming_the_paraguayan_economy_desc: "Independence for Paraguay is a tricky matter since our region is not the most profitable nor the most valuable. We must become more financially responsible and fiscally viable so that the economy of Paraguay can be in consistent growth rather than stagnation or decline, and how do we do this? Through active reform efforts ranging from coinage reforms to trade policy revisions."
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo: "Legacy of the Open Cabildo"
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo_desc: "What equates to an 'Open Town Hall', the Open Cabildo is partially what helped Paraguay gain its independence. Locally rooted efforts that slowly rose up the ranks to the administration and such, it is these town halls that we need to continue to have in Paraguay to help regulate the administration down to the community level."
 cultivate_paraguays_heart: "Cultivate the Heart of Paraguay"
 cultivate_paraguays_heart_desc: "At the end of the day, Paraguay is the little nation of South America and needs to rely more on itself than others for improvement. It is possible though it will not be easy to do this, but if we can manage to pull through tumultuous politics and stave off foreign invasions, the administration of Paraguay will be one of the highest functioning ones in South America."

 PEU_ideas_bonus: "Peruvians Ambition"
 backbone_of_the_andes: "Backbone of the Andes Mountains"
 backbone_of_the_andes_desc: "The great Andes Mountains, what a marvelous and treacherous natural feature they are! And how gracious of nature to grant Peru such a formidable natural defensive mechanism. Any enemies who dare try to invade Peru's heartland will be left wanting as the high peaks and rough inclines and declines punish even the most valiant regiment of soldiers, cavalry, and cannons."
 settle_with_the_various_natives: "Settle with the Natives"
 settle_with_the_various_natives_desc: "The native people of Peru are fierce in their fighting and numerous in their communities. We cannot hope to survive as a functional state if we do not cooperate with them on a number of levels. Thus, we need to integrate them both into the economy and into the military of Peru instead of being at constant war with them."
 extracting_minerals: "Extracting Peruvian Minerals"
 extracting_minerals_desc: "The mountains of Peru are lucrative and full of resources that can be extracted... If one is daring enough to brave the sides of the steep Andes Mountains, that is. Intrepid and valiant Peruvian workers are suited for this task though, since they know the terrain well and are properly equipped to excavate what ores and minerals lie beneath our feet."
 rising_tide_of_liberty: "The Tide of Liberty"
 rising_tide_of_liberty_desc: "Liberty is something Peruvians have desired for a long while, but it was out of reach for so many years. Alas, our day had finally come and gone and revolutionary fervor peaked when our independence was at hand, but what now? We cannot let that flame of liberty just die away, we must keep the torch lit so that other nations of the Americas may follow our path! We can help our brothers and sisters across the continent be free from colonial oppression!"
 natural_peruvian_fortifications: "Natural Fortifications"
 natural_peruvian_fortifications_desc: "Utilizing the Andes Mountains is part of our defensive military doctrine is certainly a plus, but building modern fortifications into or on the mountains themselves can really cut down on fortification maintenance. If they're designed just right, some parts of our fortresses won't even need to be manned!"
 pacific_bound_trade: "Pacific Ocean Traders"
 pacific_bound_trade_desc: "The Pacific Ocean is lucrative for trade, especially since vessels capable of faring the large swaths of water are becoming very common. Investing in the ports on Peru's coast will undoubtedly bolster the trade sector since we are one of the major Pacific Ocean traders in the Americas already."
 center_at_the_city_of_kings: "Proclaim the City of Kings"
 center_at_the_city_of_kings_desc: "Our, nicknamed by locals as the 'City of Kings' may be a bit strange considering our liberal ideas about governance and our independence war itself, but its name symbolizes the crowning of a city to rule over Peru and all of its inhabitants, both indigenous and not. It will be a glorious city upheld by citizens and politicians alike, and none shall tear it down."

 utilize_the_venezuelan_coasts_desc: "We are blessed with viable coasts that can harbor both growing settlements and docks for our growing fleet. In the future, we should work toward projecting Venezuelan power outward via a continuous building up of our fleet and dockyards."
 cocoa_plantations: "Cocoa Plantations"
 cocoa_plantations_desc: "The lands of Venezuela are not ripe for growing every kind of crop, but if there is one particular crop that we can grow in excess for the world market, it is cocoa. By encouraging plantations of cocoa to be brought up and managed effectively, we can expand our influence in the various markets around the world that crave cocoa."
 the_cabildos_of_venezuela: "Let the Communities be Heard"
 the_cabildos_of_venezuela_desc: "The local gatherings of people called 'cabildos' are in essence town/city councils. Such local councils helped Venezuela gain its independence and should continue to be utilized in the governance of Venezuela so that locals can always be heard."
 thirst_for_knowledge: "Thirst for Knowledge"
 thirst_for_knowledge_desc: "Due to our location, we are in a good location to garner information from the lands of Europe and Africa and we have an easier time facilitating travel to both places. As such, the wealthier people of Venezuela have a lust for knowledge that must be quenched as we go forth; schools, libraries, and universities throughout Venezuela should be able to satiate this desire."
 work_through_racial_divides: "Racial Divides in Venezuela"
 work_through_racial_divides_desc: "The colonial past of Venezuela is not filled with purely wholesome times since we inherited much of what our former overlords did in their own land. One particularly hard subject is that of racial divides that are now being brought to the surface of Venezuelan politics, and as we go forth into the future, we will need to address them via legislative measures and steady administrative reforms."
 royalists_in_venezuela: "Defeat the Royalists"
 royalists_in_venezuela_desc: "Royalist sentiment is something we cannot bare to stand in Venezuela. Royalists are spread beyond our borders and throughout various communities of ours and at times, they feel that they can overthrow the governing body of Venezuela. We will show them just how righteous our authority is, and just how disciplined one must be in order to win over the hearts and minds of Venezuelans."
 charting_out_a_venezuelan_future: "A Sustainable Future"
 charting_out_a_venezuelan_future_desc: "The future is shrouded in fog to all, but none more so that Venezuela. If we are to make a sustainable and prosperous future for our people, we must look at our own cities and towns and see what they need. Once we can provide our own people the infrastructure they strive for, we will then be able to extend a firm hand of friendship to those beyond our borders."
 HAT_ideas: "Haitian Ideas"
 HAT_ideas_start: "Haitian Traditions"
 HAT_ideas_bonus: "Haitian Ambition"
 valued_exports_of_haiti: "Valued Exports"
 valued_exports_of_haiti_desc: "Haiti is prized for its exports since it is readily able to produce vast quantities of sugar and other resources if plantations and farm estates are set up. Whilst some may not like this fact, we must embrace it and begin trading in what made us valuable in the first place so that the Haitian economy can thrive."
 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering: "Raiding and Privateering"
 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering_desc: "Since our path to independence, the Haitian people (civilians and soldiers alike) have observed the uncouth ways of conducting warfare around us. Raiding on land and at sea and taking off before the enemy can catch you, it's dishonorable and harsh in all the right ways! These tactics that we employed in our fight for independence should become regular strategies we use in whatever battle we find ourselves in!"
 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti: "Once Profitable, Still Profitable"
 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti_desc: "Though our independence brought a slight drop in economic activity around Haitian land and Haitian coasts, we are very much still a profitable nation. Refining and fixing up the plantations, diversifying the crops we grow, and implementing modernizing economic reforms over the coming decades wil help bring life back into the Haitian economy."
 implementing_revolutionary_ideals: "New Ideals for a New State"
 implementing_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "The ideas we espoused during our bid for independence were roundly criticized and rejected by our former colonial masters, but they have no say in our administration anymore now do they? We can implement the new ideals our scholars and officers had in mind and become something of a bastion of liberty to the regions near us."
 hardened_from_fighting_for_freedom: "Disciplined for Liberty"
 hardened_from_fighting_for_freedom_desc: "Haitian soldiers have not lost the tenacity and discipline they had from the skirmishes and pitched battles we fought against our former colonial overlord. They fought with what we modern weapons and modern tactics and the utmost discipline and we will strive to maintain that zeal in our military going forward."
 securing_trade_in_the_caribbean: "Securing the Caribbean"
 securing_trade_in_the_caribbean_desc: "If we cannot ensure that our coastal waters are safe, Haiti is a nation exposed and naked to outside invasions from any direction! We must have a sustainable fleet that can protect our trade routes and our coasts. Our soldiers on land are already prepared to fight and die for our continued independence, but is our navy ready?"
 never_let_our_guard_down: "Never Let Our Guard Down"
 never_let_our_guard_down_desc: "Constantly on guard; ever vigilant for reprisal attacks from hungry colonial powers. Haiti needs a strong standing army and navy to keep itself safe and to help protect the liberty that we fought so hard for in the past. Formal officer and admiral ranks, proper payments to sailors and soldiers, it is all part of making Haiti a power that can sustain itself when no others are around to help."

 sca_dockyards_of_scandinavia: "Dockyards of Scandinavia"
 sca_dockyards_of_scandinavia_desc: "What would Scandinavia be without its great dockyards and viable ports? Absolutely nothing, that is what! Since our time of dominance in the Viking Age to right now, the people of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have been able to field great numbers of ships for battle and trade, and even the Sapmi and Finnish people helped contribute to this effort. We will be sure that in the future we will always have room for a grand fleet that can challenge any of our rivals."
 sca_religious_fervor_in_the_north: "Scandinavian Religiosity"
 sca_religious_fervor_in_the_north_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has broken ties of kinship and friendship all throught the heart of Europe and even in Scandinavia, people were shaken to their very core by the questions posed by Martin Luther and his followers. We should not let these questions stall us forever though, for we Scandinavians can decide for ourselves what path is truly the righteous one. We will lead our people through the fires of religious conflict and see a brighter tomorrow... Perhaps one free from heretics as well."
 sca_dominate_the_baltic: "Baltic Domination"
 sca_dominate_the_baltic_desc: "The Baltic Sea is a dangerous one by some standards. In previous eras it was dominated by the Hanseatic League stemming from Northern Germany, but Scandinavians as well as Russians have always had a hand in Baltic trade as well. Now that Scandinavia is united, we should be putting forth our merchants and mercantile fleets all throughout the Baltic to secure more and more trade for ourselves, denying our rivals of the valuable income that stems from the trade routes in what should be referred to as the 'Scandinavian Sea'."
 sca_reformation_administration: "Modernize Scandinavia"
 sca_reformation_administration_desc: "Feudalism is at its end in many parts of Europe, though unjust monarchs and bishops would see to it that the old social order is maintained despite what new advances there are in governance and what new ideas are spreading throughout all of Europe. Scandinavia shall not be one that clings to the feudal past and will instead look to the future, shaping its administrative body to match incoming ideas regarding how to deal with politics, diplomacy, and military matters."
 sweden_manage_the_estates: "Manage the Estates"
 sweden_manage_the_estates_desc: "The various estates that have large powerbases throughout core Swedish land are crucial to the survival of all of Scandinavia. Whilst we can contend easily with Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Sapmi estates, the Swedish estates continually wield considerable power that we must strive to balance in the coming ages."
 sweden_caroleans: "Enter: The Caroleans"
 sweden_caroleans_desc: "The manpower and resources of Scandinavia as a whole are not like those of the Holy Roman Empire, France, or the Ottoman Empire. We must learn to innovate and make do with what we already do have and extract all that we can and more from our soldiers. Thus, our military strategies and battle tactics are going to need to take a turn toward offense instead of defense, trading pure staying power through sheer numbers for professional and disciplined men of great caliber, and the Swedish sector of Scandinavia will help lead this charge into a new military era."
 sweden_absolutism_from_stockholm: "From Stockholm, Outwards"
 sweden_absolutism_from_stockholm_desc: "There are various cities and towns throughout Scandinavia that strive for their own distinguished identity and autonomy from the crown in Stockholm, but can we really allow this to stand? Monarchs may indeed be checked by the people they rule over, but the entirety of the administration needs to have its laws heard and followed by every town and city of significant standing within Scandinavia's borders. We will be sure that local authorities have clear access to the precise legislation that is passed by our government in Stockholm."
 norway_north_sea_sailors: "North Sea Sailors"
 norway_north_sea_sailors_desc: "Our endless expeditions across the North Sea and far beyond toward Iceland and Greenland are the stuff of legends, but the legends are a reality that is shrouded in the sands of time. Norwegian people though, unlike those of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the far north, are much more adept at sailing through the open waters. Whether it is because of our innate love for the open waters or our strategic homeland position along the North Sea, the bulk of our great sailors will hail from Norwegian cities and they will lead us toward glory."
 norway_legacy_of_the_longship: "Legacy of the Longship"
 norway_legacy_of_the_longship_desc: "The most infamous vessel from the Viking Age is that which is called the longship. Longships were crafted specifically toward the environment they were going to be sailing in and also could be used as steady platforms for man-to-man fighting on the open water. Their grand design and high value back then gives all of Scandinavia something to look back upon, and most importantly it gives the Norwegian engineers and shipbuilders inspiration to innovate on current ship designs so that our future fleets will be sturdier and more robust than anything our foes can muster."
 norway_premier_fleet_of_the_world: "The Premier Fleet of Scandinavia"
 norway_premier_fleet_of_the_world_desc: "Whilst the English in the Isles may think of themselves as the greatest naval power there can be, Norwegians being aided by their fellow Swedes, Finns, Sapmi, and Danish kin are quickly growing strong enough to challenge the English and any others major naval power. Our fleet is the pride and the heart of Scandinavia and it will be what brings a new era of greatness and glory to all of Scandinavia."
 denmark_kalmar_union_lessons: "Memory of the Kalmar Union"
 denmark_kalmar_union_lessons_desc: "The Kalmar Union, started in 1397 via the efforts of Queen Margaret I of Denmark and Eric of Pomerania, was a pivotal moment in the history of Scandinavia as a whole. None could have envisioned what it would do to shape our politics and foreign relations, but it succeeded in its main goal: stopping German expansion northward into the Baltic Sea and into Scandinavian lands. The union as a whole was not smooth though, and there were many issues between the three main people groups of the union that eventually pulled it apart from every possible angle. We will learn from this period in our history and institute reforms so that a union like it will never fall apart again."
 denmark_the_legacy_of_cnut: "Legacy of Cnut the Great"
 denmark_the_legacy_of_cnut_desc: "Denmark's history of attempting to unite Scandinavia and beyond stretches back not only to the days of the Kalmar Union, but back to the days of Cnut the Great. Trying to unify the lands of Scandinavia and the Isles is a monumental task and the failure of Cnut's successors is shameful, but valuable in what it left behind: a legacy of conquest. The blood of the Danish people is not satisfied with simply being the leading part of Scandinavia, no, it strives to expand outward and to retake what rightfully belongs to Scandinavian people and more!"
 denmark_commandeer_trade: "Scandinavia's Fair Cut"
 denmark_commandeer_trade_desc: "Though we are extremely fond of the Sound Toll that has been contested by Germans across the northern coast for ages, we will need to commandeer more trade routes and markets to enforce Scandinavian influence in more places; this alongside increasing the wealth flowing into our treasury too. Once more places of trade are secured, we can bolster the value in these places through setting up prominent networks of traders and merchants whilst also establishing firm relations with nearby neighboring lands (if they're not hostile to us, that is)."
 finland_hakkapeliitat: "Hakkapeliitta! Cut Them Down!"
 finland_hakkapeliitat_desc: "Though we may resent the Swedish people to a fair degree for past slights against us, the military arm of the Finnish people have taken up the military initiative that the Swedish seem to naturally have. The development of light cavalry is slowly taken root in Finnish ranks in the Scandinavian military, and the motto that these light cavalry regiments put forth, 'hakkaa päälle!' ('Cut them down!'), is exactly what they're excelling at: swift and ruthless charges against the enemy, brutal yet precise raids, and ingenious scouting for military maneuvers."
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry: "Listen to the Peasants"
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry_desc: "The peasants are often not represented fairly in Scandinavia for a myriad of reasons, but in Finnish lands, peasants have held a slightly higher status and wield slightly more power than they do in the lands of the Swedish, Danish, or Norwegians. Why is this? It is because we know that they too have ideas and thoughts that need to be heard just like those of the nobility and the merchants of Scandinavia. Extending this mindset across our government can and will help make it more flexible and able to address the concerns of many people groups inside our borders."
 finland_extensive_defenses: "Ice and Stone"
 finland_extensive_defenses_desc: "Whilst the White Death is what keeps the lands of Scandinavia's northern sector fairly secure, it is the job of staunch fortifications like the one at Viborg to hold off enemies in warmer climates. If we can build stronger and more extensive defenses throughout Scandinavia whilst also utilizing the seasons to our advantage, there will be no nation in the world that can penetrate beyond just a couple provinces into Scandinavia's heartland."
 sapmi_swift_movements: "Swift Movements"
 sapmi_swift_movements_desc: "If there is one thing that the Sapmi people of the north have instilled into the hearts and minds of the military officers of Scandinavia, it is that fast and precise movement is absolutely crucial. The Land of the Midnight Sun has no mercy on those who wait too long and the same rule applies to enemies in war. Mobility will be the largest factor in driving military success for Scandinavians."
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions: "The Noaidi Traditions"
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions_desc: "The fires of religious war in Europe's heart is a raging inferno that the Sapmi have wanted no part in. The noaidi, Sapmi shamans who are the religious heads of the polytheistic Sapmi religion, bring a much needed example of tolerance in the times of religious turmoil. We can look to them for guidance and learn to accept other faiths into the fold of Scandinavia without compromising its ability to govern or defend itself from invasions."
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers: "Equality to Nomads and Settlers"
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers_desc: "Many of the Sapmi people are content with their semi-nomadic reindeer herding in the far north of Scandinavia. Though some Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish officials think it would be better if we forced these semi-nomadic people to settle down, we realize that it is in the best interest of Scandinavia if they keep to their own and are treated fairly under the government. They can help keep order in their own parts of Scandinavia if they are treated fairly and we will ensure that there is a permanent peace between the nomads and settlers of Scandinavia."
 ice_ruthless_fleet: "The Ruthless Fleet"
 ice_ruthless_fleet_desc: "The fleets of Scandinavia that dock not only in the cold ports of Iceland and the warmer ports along the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian coast knows no bounds. Shaped from having to fend off countless commerce raids and various conflicts throughout the North Sea and elsewhere, the fleet of Scandinavia will be like no other, for when one ship falls in battle, it only grows more bolder in its actions in the heat of things."
 ice_norse_endurance: "Norse Endurance"
 ice_norse_endurance_desc: "If we can endure the cold weather of Scandinavia stretching from the Land of the Midnight Sun all the way to Icelandic mountains and fjords, what can't we endure? Sure the enemy may tire out our armies in battle and seek to invade our lands, but Scandinavian people know that they must not give in and they must never give the enemy any advantage if possible. We fight to the very end, just as our Norse ancestors did."
 ice_althing_legislation: "Legacy of the Althing"
 ice_althing_legislation_desc: "The Althing, though somewhat outdated in these modern times, can still be useful on the local level of things. Icelandic ways of governance might be foreign to some Finnish, Sapmi, and Danish people, but we can introduce them to it over time and work on refining how the Althing functions as time goes on. It would certainly help build up a robust local governance structure that we can rely on."

 haven_for_freed_slaves: "Freed Slaves are Welcome"
 haven_for_freed_slaves_desc: "Florida has many small corridors and vacant plots of land that are rarely traversed by anyone from the government or from the military, making for a great amount of hiding places for slaves that are fleeing from their home or that have escaped captivity. We of Florida will gladly welcome these escaped people to our state and open our borders to them if they agree to some initial paperwork to formalize their entry. The more people we have, the better!"
 marshland_fighting: "Fighting in the Marshes"
 marshland_fighting_desc: "Florida's heartland is a humid places with very little in the way of mercy from the damp and hot climate. The natives here were used to the conditions and put up a fierce fight when we came to colonize the region and not long after we arrived, we learned just how crucial their fighting styles would be to our own survival. Fighting in the marshes is no easy task, but we are masters of it at this point and are able to resist massed musket fire like no other."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects: "Insects... And Heat..."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects_desc: "The insects of Florida are ruthless in the pain they cause and the diseases they spread! Whole communities can come down with debilitating diseases because of these menacing pests coupled with the heat and indeed we've lost thousands to them in the past, but it is through these painful experiences that we grow stronger. We are developing methods to stave off the threat of insects as well as to mitigate the impact that the heat and humidity has. Our civilians as well as our soldiers must adapt over time to how harsh this land is."
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth: "Floridian Crops"
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth_desc: "Our land is ripe for growing hemp, sugar, and indigo, but we can only utilize so much of the land for our crops before trying to go to war for more land. Perhaps we can expand our reach inland and carve out more places for plantations and farms through land development. It'll take years to do, but in time we should see a general rise in how much we produce and how well our economy can do on the world stage."
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications: "Outposts and Watchtowers"
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications_desc: "Castles and bastions with great walls of stone are few and far between in the Floridian heartland since the ground to build on is often wet, unstable, and prone to changes over the years. That is why we build several fortified outposts and watchtowers equipped with skilled shooters and runners for communication, and on top of all that these defensive structures are much easier to build than a normal castle. We'd do well to continue building these light defenses in the future to help slow down any advancing enemies."
 floridian_harbors: "Floridian Harbors"
 floridian_harbors_desc: "Whilst we have marshy terrain all around our heartland, we have waters of all kinds around us that are fit for trade and combat. Being that so much potential for Florida lies not just in its land and people but also out at sea, we should be keen on building up suitable harbors and docks for our fleet of ships. There is plenty of suitable coastline to start with so, we're already a step ahead of some regions nearby."
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives: "Social Mobility"
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives_desc: "Natives and freed slaves in our lands cannot be held back forever by our culture and government since they can provide so much in the form of taxes, production, and military manpower. If we build schools and libraries, we can also help these people rise through the society to become great Floridian administrators, but in order for any of this to happen, we need to embark on a policy of change and reform that staunchly encourages social mobility."

 organized_settlement_of_land: "Organize the Settlements"
 organized_settlement_of_land_desc: "If we can organized the land of Illinois and how the Illinoisan people settle on it, we can gain so much more in the form of tax revenue in the years to come. Along with that going for us later on, we can promote the proper development of the land via organized cutting down of various woodlands and the cultivation of specially designated crop areas."
 combat_against_natives: "When We Must Fight"
 combat_against_natives_desc: "Though it hasn't been often that we of Illinois are needed to fight extensively, we have been called upon to defend our own settlements from various native tribes in the past and even to this day. We must be sure that we have enough troops to man the defensive structures we have and to also do battle with any enemy force that seeks to destroy what we've worked so hard to build up over the decades."
 utilize_water_ways: "The Ease of Rivers"
 utilize_water_ways_desc: "Rivers, where would be without rivers? They're a great way of transporting goods to far away places with less work (most of the time), they provide a source of water to us, and they also help indicate where other potentially friendly settlements might be. The more we can use the rivers to our advantage in terms of trade and business deals, the better off we will be as a whole."
 tenuous_borders: "Finding the Real Borders"
 tenuous_borders_desc: "Due to where we are situated, borders are less cut-and-dry compared to other places that are more heavily inhabited by dense cities and dedicated roads. As a result, we're often redefining where our borders are at the local level with various communities and towns on the border with our neighbors. When push comes to shove and war breaks out though, we can use this to our advantage and use some very favorable maps at the peace conference that allow us to take even more land."
 wealth_over_war: "Wealth Over War"
 wealth_over_war_desc: "If we can avoid war, we'd rather do so than take our chances with our economy and investments. By focusing our economy and administration more so on internal development and the securing of trade deals from various regions nearby our own, we'll be able to get a greater amount of overall wealth than we would've gotten through wars that could go any which way."
 fortification_at_our_front: "In Defense of Illinois"
 fortification_at_our_front_desc: "We will defend what is rightfully ours to the very end. The gold and silver we've brought into our treasury and the wealth we've created for our citizens, it will not be robbed by the greedy hands of war or other disasters. If we need to build up even more fortifications than what we already have in order to protect our precious cities and people, then so be it."

 urbanize_further_desc: "Our island is large enough and also flat enough to support larger cities in comparison to what other islands around the Caribbean can support. Because of this, we have gained a great number of settlers over the decades both before and after our independence. These settlers will be useful in not only expanding Cuban military measures and economic aspects, but they will also help develop new settlements all across our central island and beyond."
 centralize_governance_in_cuba: "Strong Central Governance"
 centralize_governance_in_cuba_desc: "Cuba is a place of splendor and majesty, but also a place of strong central authority and governance. Even before we gained independence, we had a strong administration that oversaw the entirety of Cuban domains so that the rise in the amount of settlers coming to our land would be organized properly. We will keep this legacy of central authority and without a doubt enforce our laws and legislation with fairness all throughout Cuba."

As time goes on, we will ensure that our profits will only increase thanks to our protection and beneficial investments along the trade routes in our grasp, and perhaps in time we could reach out to different regions of trade and start making money there as well."
 defend_cuban_waters: "Cuban Waters"
 defend_cuban_waters_desc: "We have seen battle after battle take place near our shores with various fleets being destroyed and whole crews of sailors going down into the murky depths below. Cuba is not safe without a navy nor a military, but if we cannot protect our coasts from imperial colonizers like our former overlord, what good are we as a nation? We will make it known that the waters around our central island are Cuban waters, defended by the grandest fleet in the entire Caribbean."
 trade_with_new_world_polities: "New World Trade Deals"
 trade_with_new_world_polities_desc: "With our independence secured and the wars for independence raging on throughout the various parts of the New World, we should take the time to start investing in these upcoming states who are fighting for their own rights and values. We are a much better trade partner for them than the colonial overlords that seek only to extract wealth from colonial entities, so we can go forth with some safety knowing that we will be seen in a more favorable light."
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy: "Uphold the Cuban Fleet"
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy_desc: "Naval strategy and the perfection of it over time is tough, but Cuba is uniquely situated to be at the forefront of this endeavor. Defending our waters and engaging in various wars that involve conflicts on the high seas will continually breed stronger and more adept admirals and sailors who know exactly what to do in the midst of a broadside battle. We have faith that our fleet can withstand whatever comes their way in the future."
 armed_at_all_times: "Never Surrender"
 armed_at_all_times_desc: "And should any enemy land on Cuban shores, they will find not a welcoming local population that takes them in without trouble. Instead, they will find a population of righteous people armed with muskets and rifles, willing to fight to keep the liberty that was gained so many years ago. There will be no mercy when an enemy steps foot into our land, just like they would have no mercy on us if Cubans were to do the same."

 a_crimson_laden_culture_desc: "We are very distinct from our neighbors in a number of ways, but perhaps the most blatant way we are different is through the distinctly red colored clothing we wear and our red wall paintings and murals. Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"
 diarchical_administration: "Diarchical Administration"
 diarchical_administration_desc: "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly: the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."
 adorn_the_dead: "Adorn the Dead"
 adorn_the_dead_desc: "The dead of Ichma must not be sent off with nothing but dirt and rocks at their side, no, that would be degrading their worth! They must their valuables and jewels buried with them, at least partly, so that their journey to the afterlife is not a dark and burdensome one. In this way, we honor our recently deceased men and women and bring peace to their body at least in this realm. We only hope that in the next realm, they are as well off as they were here."
 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion: "The Pyramids of the Ichma"
 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion_desc: "How can we contact the divine? How can we properly ascertain their messages and send messages back to them? It is certainly not out in the open with harsh conditions beating down at us whilst we are the midst of the gods, so the pyramids of our ancestors can do just fine. It will not be only those pyramids though, for we can build more as time goes on in other places where the Ichma people settle down into."
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old: "The Pieces of the Wari Empire"
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old_desc: "The breakup of the Wari Empire was long ago, but we remember rightly that the Ichma people came about in the ashes of the burning state. Not only us, but many others got their start when the Wari Empire began to burn, leading to several confederacies of people forming afterwards. Some may still be around and some may have been conquered, but we of Ichma must do what we can to reunite the old lands of the Wari Empire."

 huaca_of_the_ichma_desc: "A huaca is something of a monument, sometimes natural and sometimes man-made, that is revered by not only our people but also by other people around us. Some huaca are known to have rituals of veneration and devotion dedicated to them whilst others are along pilgrimage routes for our various gods. The more huaca we can get under our control, the more unified and satiated our people will be."

 successor_to_the_wari_people_desc: "The memories of the old Wari Empire fade away as time goes on; their old cities and artificats are not going to be around forever, but what they put forth can still be a foundation to build upon. Let us renew the efforts of the Wari people of old and pick up where they left off, triumphing over disasters that come our way and military foes who seek to dismantle our power."

 tholing_tabo_and_khochar_monasteries_desc: "Yeshe-Ö, the second king after our founding, was perhaps the greatest leader from our past. Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."
 old_city_of_tsaparang: "The City of Tsaparang"
 old_city_of_tsaparang_desc: "Though it was not always our capital, Tsaparang has become a haven for the rulers of Guge. It has slowly been built up over time due partially to the fact that successful claimants in civil wars centering around Tsaparang instead of Tholing, meaning that today Tsaparang is something that inspires both faith in the ruler of Guge and trust in their governance."
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival: "The Revivers of Tibetan Buddhism"
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival_desc: "There is one key title that we of Guge hold: the revivers of Tibetan Buddhism. The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."
 strive_for_religious_education: "Religious Education"
 strive_for_religious_education_desc: "Though education is seen as necessary to progress in life by many, few in Guge are able to actually become literate and fully capable of being productive in life despite being fully fledged Buddhists. Let us work to change this as time goes on and promote the building of not only monasteries in our lands, but also libraries and schools that focus on Buddhist texts and also other subjects such as mathematics and geography."
 ready_to_reform_the_faith: "Another Revival?"
 ready_to_reform_the_faith_desc: "The way Buddhism currently is in Tibetan land is not going to stay the same forever since, over the coming decades, we will gain new people and followers who bring new perspectives on old texts, mantras, and traditions that we already know so well. What then do we do and say to these new insights? We welcome them, of course! We will bring them into the wider inter-faith dialogue and be ready to reform our understanding of canonical texts, but it will take time for this to happen."
 converse_with_indian_buddhists: "Conferences and Conversations"
 converse_with_indian_buddhists_desc: "We are not going to be closed off to the other branches of Buddhism that are spread throughout the various lands around Tibet. The traditions of the Indian people, the traditions of the Chinese, the traditions of the Burmese and Thai, they can all contribute to the wider dialogue and conversation we of Guge wish to have, but we simply need more people ready and willing to travel these long distances. Perhaps setting up a formal diplomatic sector is in order?"
 cultural_blending_in_guge: "All Under the Guidance of Guge"
 cultural_blending_in_guge_desc: "Guge has proven itself to be a guiding pillar of Buddhism before when all was thought to be lost in Tibetan lands; when Buddhism seemed to be fragmented to the point of no return. With the resurgance of the grand faith thanks to our hard work and reforms, we can now work on assimilating the various people who are coming into the fold of Guge so that they too can come toward the path of enlightenment. We cannot and will not deny anybody this right in Guge."

 utilize_religious_sects_desc: "There are a variety of small and large schools of Buddhism throughout Tibet and all are useful for various purposes, but when push comes to shove in politics, we will pull all the strings we can to enlist the help of these various Buddhist schools. We are not averse to fighting like some smaller polities are, for we have been in the midst of fighting for decades now! Fighting to secure our place in Tibet and fighting to have our words become law!"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch: "Uphold the Karma Kagyu School"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch_desc: "We are not patrons of the Gelug school of Vajrayana Buddhism which some find strange. Instead, we support the Karma Kagyu school which is quite different in a number of ways when compared to the Gelug school. Its traditional hierarchs, the Karmapa and Shamarpa, should be great friends of our dynasty instead of having to quarrel with other religious schools; they will know our good will and will be one of the strategic pillars of our rise to power."
 sort_through_muddy_marriages: "Profit from Bad Marriages"
 sort_through_muddy_marriages_desc: "Marriages can be a... Tough negotiation for some, to put it nicely, and this is very widely pronounced in the royal families of Tibet since a failing marriage or two in a royal family can lead to widespread discontent in places far away from the royal palace. We were ones to capitalize on marriage conflicts in the previous royal family of Tibet, the Phagmodrupa, and we will continue to profit from future bad marriages around us whilst make sure our own marriages are safe and without issue."

 at_the_heart_of_turmoil_desc: "There is no shortage of warfare in the heartlands of Tibet. Local lords wanting autonomy, Nepali states struggling against Hindu and Islamic states to the south, Muslim khans to the north threatening our survival, nothing is ever easy up here! If continued war is required to survive in our own land than we will take up arms without hesitation!"
 keep_the_sects_loyal: "Keeping the Sects Loyal"
 keep_the_sects_loyal_desc: "The Rinpungpa dynasty must not lose the favor of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism nor the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism that have sent aid in the past. We should be enforcing more secular authority over these sects when possible, or if this is not possible, then at least be informed about the moves these sects are making so that we can effectively counter them politically or religiously when the time comes."
 put_pretenders_to_rest: "Confront Pretenders"
 put_pretenders_to_rest_desc: "Some still see us as pretenders to the throne and think that the Phagmodrupa dynasty should be empowered once again, but we simply cannot let this happen. The Rinpungpa dynasty is in a much better place than the Phagmodrupa dynasty ever was, and if there are any pretenders who wish to install this old dynasty back on the throne, we will gladly meet them in battle or silence them before they can even raise a war banner."
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans: "Refuse Local Lords"
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans_desc: "The loyalty of local lords is always questionable in Tibet, is it not? Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Rinpungpa dynasty. Autonomous lords and authorities that answered to previous people we conquered will be granted no quarter; they will be replaced."

 gongchen_monastery_desc: "Founded by the Thangtong Gyalpo, also known as the Iron Bridge Maker, the Gonchen Monastery is perhaps one of the most revered places in all of Kham next to the royal palace itself. The monastery has stripes of white, dark red, and gray colors that are unique to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and itt is through this monastery that we will project our legitimacy and devotion to all the people of Kham."
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Material Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The great Thangtong Gyalpo graced many with his presence and works, including us who administrate Kham. He built our revered Gonchen Monastery and also was an adept architect, blacksmith, and civil engineer, making his impact known in the various lands of Tibet and Bhutan. Not only this, but he also considered the patron saint of theatre in our lands and he is known as 'the madman of the empty land'. Truly his impact on our land and history is unparalleled."
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Spiritual Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The works of Thangtong Gyalpo were not only in the physical realm though! His work extended far into the realm of Tibetan Buddhism since he is associated with the Shangpa Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sakya schools. Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."
 uphold_dege: "Upholding Dege"
 uphold_dege_desc: "Dege, as our capital city, should be upheld in the highest regard next to the various monasteries and sacred sites we possess. It should be built up to not only project our prominence, but also to attract foreign scholars and religious folk who also wish to come toward the path of Buddhism. As Kham continues to grow outward, so too will our capital city."
 uphold_tibetan_literature: "Tibetan Literature"
 uphold_tibetan_literature_desc: "Literature in Tibetan lands can be somewhat scarce and lacking due to a variety of reasons, but as time goes on, the potential for this to change is becoming more and more abundant to us. By putting through reforms to start paper production and to educate the minds of younger and younger people, we can begin to cultivate a strong literary culture throughout Kham."
 formalize_derge_districts: "Formalize the Districts"
 formalize_derge_districts_desc: "City organization in Tibet hasn't been the highest priority to many leaders both local and royal, but routinely we are seeing the need to plan our cities out more and more as time goes on. Starting with Dege, we should work to plan out our new districts in various cities with engineers and workers alike so that buildings are as functional as possible and also robust in their construction."
 chinese_contacts: "Chinese Contacts"
 chinese_contacts_desc: "To our east is the Sichuan Basin, a great trading hub for Tibetans and Chinese people alike. Chengdu may be ethnically Chinese, but we are thankful that it has blossomed into a grand city of trade and production since the path from Chengdu to Dege is fairly clear to many. Contacts with our eastern neighbors will only continue to serve us well later on as trade grows ever more plentiful."

 after_the_yuan_dynasty_desc: "After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty to our east, the authority in Tibet that the Mongols once had waned heavily and we were one of the bastions of Tibetan strength. Our dynasty created an autonomous Tibetan state and formally threw off the shackles of Mongol authority and it is because of this that many still flock to our banners."
 regents_for_the_old_kings: "Regents to the Old Kings"
 regents_for_the_old_kings_desc: "Our early rulers did not strive for earthly titles that gave meaningless honor, for they knew that they were regents for the old kings of Tibet. The glory of those olden days may not be coming back any time soon, but we can still strive to be humble like our first set of rulers and live as they did, for the Tibetan people and by Tibetan laws."
 fortified_city_governance: "Dzong Governance"
 fortified_city_governance_desc: "To help organize our political situation, forming a solid basis for authority beneath us was crucial in our upbringing. The creation of dzongs (fortified cities meant for local governance) helped cement our authority on the local level and did a great amount of work in projecting our power throughout Tibet when we were much larger in size."
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land: "Staunchly Tibetan Laws"
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land_desc: "No longer are we ruled by Mongolian laws, but rather by Tibetan laws! Those foreign edicts and measures put on our people in the past were undoubtedly burdensome, but now since we've been independent, we have been able to implement laws meant for our own people. No longer will we bear the weight of the old Mongol authorities."
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside: "Neutral Relations are Good Relations"
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside_desc: "When the Ming Dynasty rose up in the place of the Yuan Dynasty, it was clear that they did not think much of us in Tibet. These fairly neutral relations were and still are beneficial to us, since we can thrive whilst being left alone and not pressured diplomatically from various sides."
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty: "Three Parts to the Dynasty"
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty_desc: "The Phagmodrupa dynasty is divided up into three parts: the ruling 'desi', the spiritual masters (chen-nga), and the preserver of the family (dunggyu dsinpa). This helps ensure not only the piety of our lineage, but also the continuation of far into the future... But, it can also lead to a number of internal feuds if we are not careful."
 the_fire_of_feuds: "Fires in our Family"
 the_fire_of_feuds_desc: "Failed marriages and corruption are not strangers to the Phagmodrupa dynasty, not since the Rinpungpa dynasty has risen up and taken advantage of our vulnerable position in the past. We need to learn how to sort out our internal conflicts in the future so that we can prevent future disturbances and revolts, and most of all, we will exact revenge upon the Rinpungpa dynasty."

Some of these old road networks and paths we can still use, and Cajamarca's foundation will be built off of moving quickly thanks to these old paths between villages and towns."
 beacon_of_culture: "Beacon of Culture"
 beacon_of_culture_desc: "Cajamarca is perhaps the most complex and grand political state that emerged after the collapse of the Wari Empire. Though we are not on the level of the Wari Empire in terms of size or strength, we still have some of the finest pottery and works of art in all of the mountainous land. Surely over time we will attract the likes of various scholars and religious people alike who will serve in Cajamarca."
 experiences_from_civil_wars: "Civil Wars are Experience"
 experiences_from_civil_wars_desc: "In our past, civil conflict was something that we could not avoid. Even today, civil war looms on the horizon and threatens our people with devasation if politics in Cajamarca decline horribly. But, there is one thing that these wretched conflicts breed in our soldiers: experience. How to prepare for battle and get supply lines ready, these are things they'll never forget thanks to our previous eras of internal strife."
 from_oral_tradition_to_written: "Begin Writing"
 from_oral_tradition_to_written_desc: "Oral tradition is a great thing for Cajamarca and indeed many of the surrounding people groups we interact with, but oral history is something we cannot rely on forever. We should begin a new effort to formally begin making a writing system for our people so that the oral history of our ancestors may never be truly lost, even when our current elders pass away."
 start_roads_of_cajamarca: "Start Building Roads"
 start_roads_of_cajamarca_desc: "Old Wari paths are just the perfect places for future road networks. The innovations in road making done by those in Cusco are spreading quickly and we of Cajamarca would be wise to adopt them, utilizing their fine designs for ourselves and having our military officers trained in exactly how the should operate."
 fighting_the_quito: "Quito Conflicts"
 fighting_the_quito_desc: "The northern area where the Quito people live is a place of consistent conflict. Though some chiefs and rulers have made peace with us before, more often than not our interests are in conflict with each other. In order to fully subjugate the Quito people and perhaps any others who would wish to go against our interests, we will need a larger standing military."
 the_cuismancu_state: "A True Cajamarca State"
 the_cuismancu_state_desc: "The consistent fighting and bloodshed in the mountains is only hardening Cajamarca and its people from all walks of life. We are learning how to govern more effectively, utilize diplomacy to our advantage, and also how to enforce higher military standards as time goes on.

It is a faded memory, but one that is distinct and unique to us as Yellow Uyghurs or, Yugurs as sometimes we are called. This period was prosperous for us indeed, but also a time of intense warfare between us and various other people since we occupied a very valuable position. It is this tradition of warfare that we still remember to this day."

 our_trade_is_warfare_desc: "Even when we held the position as a mighty kingdom, war was still part of our life, year by year and decade by decade. After our destruction and period of subjugation by the Tanguts and later by the Western Xia and then the Mongols, we remember just how integral war has been for us. Conquest is the only path for us in the future, and there will be no satiating this ambition within the Yugur people."
 the_influences_of_buddhism: "Influences of Buddhism"
 the_influences_of_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism has come into the lands of the Uyghurs due to being so close to Tibet and the Chinese people, though the latter practice Confucianism along with Buddhism. We are not opposed to Buddhism and its influences since its teaching can often go hand-in-hand with the traditions of Tengri. Perhaps in time we can even learn to become somewhat tolerant of foreign faiths that don't line up with with the traditions of Tengri, but that is for later."
 learn_from_tangut_dominance: "Tales of the Tangut Period"
 learn_from_tangut_dominance_desc: "The destruction of our old kingdom led into a period where we were dominated by the Tanguts. It was a dark time where we were forced from a place of grace into a place of relative uncertainty and subjugation. It is something we will never forget and something we will fight to never let happen to us again."
 the_western_xia_war: "The Western Xia War"
 the_western_xia_war_desc: "In the times of our old kingdom, the Western Xia made war against us and inflicted costly casualties to our people and helped weaken us for more foreign foes later on. Learning from this costly war has led to our best commanders and officers thinking that we should be investing in a larger and more structure military instead of trying to focus on pure diplomacy to prevent such a destructive war in the future."

 the_carnage_of_oirat_ming_wars_desc: "Between the fighting that goes on between the Oirat Horde and the Ming Dynasty, we are stuck almost in the middle of it all wondering who will come out on top. If we are ambitious enough, we can capitalize on the destruction of the losing side and make valuable gains for all of Kara Del, but we will have to be strategic about when and where we strike. The traditions of our ancestors in the steppe necessitate that conquest be key to our survival, and this is the perfect playground for us to do as such."
 descendants_of_the_chagatai: "Descendants of the Chagatai Khanate"
 descendants_of_the_chagatai_desc: "Our origins lie in the thoughts and actions of a Chagatai prince in the past and to some, it is a menial origin story that has little meaning. To us though, it grants us valuable connections dynastically to the Chagatai Khanate that came after the split of the old Mongol Empire. Maintaining our dyanstic presence will ensure loyalty and legitimacy in the people we will over."
 playing_the_role_of_subject: "The Benefits of Subjugation"
 playing_the_role_of_subject_desc: "We have been subjects of larger powers in the past since Kara Del has historically been a weak power. This has its consequences of paying tribute and such, but we have benefited via taking into account the better technology and organization that our overlords had. Taking advantage of the advances our neighbors have and implementing reforms in their style, well, why wouldn't we continue to do it?"

 an_oasis_of_opportunities_desc: "Being where we are, it is a precarious set of circumstances. Several prominent states and people want our land because of how valuable it is for trade and military operations, but we are not going to just stand by and let them subjugated us. We are instead going to utilize our position in such a valuable area to increase our own revenue, capitalize on foreign contacts, and even try to become more self sustaining in the face of increasing foreign tension."

#to_what_deity_do_we_praise_desc: "We find ourselves at the confluence of several faiths: Tengri and its traditions, Islam and its five pillars, and Buddhism and its schools of thought. It is not easy choosing one religion over the other as Kara Del has populations of all three in its land, but we can at least try to make do in tolerating all three whenever possible. Promoting a stance of tolerance will undoubtedly lend to a greater amount of people flocking to our stable banner."
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat: "Contracts in the Steppe"
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat_desc: "Our connections to the Chagatai Khanate lends us connections all around the steppe which is good since there are a variety of mercenary forces that will be more in favor of working for an influential descendant of the Chagatai. Hiring these largely cavalry-based armies will cost us, but we know that they will be worth it later on since they can act as a good buffer for our own forces."
 emphasis_on_cavalry: "Embrace our Heritage"
 emphasis_on_cavalry_desc: "Though our connections with the Ming Dynasty are somewhat firm, we cannot discard our traditions nor our connections to the steppe. Cavalry armies are something that we know inside and out, and focusing on reforming how they work in battle is going to be one of our main focuses in the future.

The more we formalize it though, the more useful it will become and the more standardized it can be from place to place in our own lands, thus granting easier communication to all people in our domain."

We are seeing more and more people come south due to those struggles, however, and as a result we are becoming slowly influences by our northern neighbors.

 mutual_friendship_between_cacan_groups_desc: "There are some groups of Cacan speaking people that don't really know who to pledge fealty to or to what state they should go to. Though we speak the same language, they don't feel as closely connected to us unfortunately due to the years we have spent trying to consolidate our own power and maintain stability.

 reprisals_against_invaders_desc: "As we slowly unite the various Cacan speaking groups of people around us, we must instill in them a staunch defensive mentality against those who would invade our lands. There are some who think the lands of the Calchaqui can be just pillaged and settled by other populations, but we will bring to them a stalwart defense that will grind down their will to fight. The Cacan speaking people will not be taken out so easily."
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation: "A True Confederation"
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation_desc: "Centralizing authority in our lands is something we struggle with since people are so spread out and our work at formalizing our language is still going on, but making loyal that contribute to the Calchaqui cause nicely is much easier to do. Perhaps a federated state is not our true path, but instead a more confederated state is what will make us truly great."
 construct_calchaqui_fortifications: "Strong Stone Fortifications"
 construct_calchaqui_fortifications_desc: "To help with our defensive stance, we shall erect strong stone fortifications with multiple layers inside that can withstand enemy assaults and siege tactics. We are not going to simply put up stone slabs we find out in nature though, we are going to cut them and shape them into effective shapes and work toward making them an effective barrier that can hold back the advances of our enemy."
 until_there_is_nothing_left: "To the Bitter End"
 until_there_is_nothing_left_desc: "There will be no shortage of fighting the future as people will always seek to take advante of the Calchaqui state and its weak points, but we are prepared to hold the line and fight for our very existence if things come down to it. Our peasants will take up arms, our nobles will direct militia groups, and our leaders will draw their weapons and put it all on the line in a united effort to bring back peace to Calchaqui land."
 QTO_ideas: "Quito Ideas"
 QTO_ideas_start: "Quito Traditions"
 QTO_ideas_bonus: "Quito Ambition"
 uphold_the_shyris: "The Shyris of Quito"
 uphold_the_shyris_desc: "Our great leader, the 'Shyris', is just one factor amongst others that separates us from the states to our south. The shyris is who will lead us to victory in the great struggles we will engage in, and with each one that passes from this life into the next, an elaborate and grand burial ceremony will be held for them. To those who openly oppose the shyris, they will know only death and hardship at our hands."
 on_the_edge_of_andes_power: "The Edge of the Andes"
 on_the_edge_of_andes_power_desc: "Being at the northern edge of the Andes Mountains provides the people of Quito a unique opportunity since we can interact with a host of different tribes and groups of people who do not form cohesive states like our own. Their culture and tradtiions might very well be alien to us, but we are not beyond learning to accept them into our fold; our shyris and those around him know the value of accepting these people as they are."
 quitu_cara_cultural_power: "Quitu-Cara Culture"
 quitu_cara_cultural_power_desc: "Quito is not a political entity with a single 'Quito' culture that extends back for many centuries. Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."
 quito_tombs: "Quito Tombs"
 quito_tombs_desc: "To help decorate those who pass from this life into the next, tombs of lavish design and detail will be made out of both wood and stone alike. Honoring the dead is perhaps one of the most crucial parts of the traditions passed down to us and it is with great pride and care that we do so."
 trade_with_various_tribes: "Tribal Exchanges and Trade"
 trade_with_various_tribes_desc: "Just as we meet and try to integrate the tribes around us, we should be keen on trading with them as well. They hold connections to places far beyond our current reach, meaning we could greatly benefit from promoting trade with them over time. Even when we integrate them inside of our borders, maintaining healthy relationships with the tribal people will be key to keeping the economy of Quito running smoothly."
 integrate_the_others_into_quito: "Integrate Other Cultures"
 integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc: "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own. It is these joined hands and through bonds of kinship built up over many ages that Quito will maintain its power both politically and militarily."
 celebrate_our_lives: "Celebrate Life"
 celebrate_our_lives_desc: "Though we may give our people a grand way of being sent off into the next life, we must also take time to celebrate our own life as it is, right? Feasts filled with joy and praise to the gods above, games being played by children and adults, instruments being played by our own family members, and good times being had by all within our communities. These are the times we should relish and adore, not just the times of victory via conquest or the success of a good harvest."
 ZAF_ideas: "Massina Ideas"
 ZAF_ideas_start: "Massina Traditions"
 ZAF_ideas_bonus: "Massina Ambition"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings: "The Fulani Jihad!"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings_desc: "For far too long there have been kafirs and infidels taking power against Islamic emirs and sheiks, but no more! Massina will be one of the many spearheads of the jihad started by Fulani people and there will be Islamic justice for all those who used their power to stifle Islam's spread! To arms, brothers and sisters, to arms!"
 madrasas_of_massina: "Islamic Learning of Massina"
 madrasas_of_massina_desc: "Though Massina is new to the land it sits upon, Islam is not new and as such certain ideas about Islam are already spread heavily in certain cities of ours. Let us help promote Islam's spread by building up madrasas throughout the land so that not only can ideas be propagated over time, but also things such as literacy and mathematics can be utilized by a wider portion of the populace."
 strict_islamic_interpretation: "The Strictness of Islam"
 strict_islamic_interpretation_desc: "There can be no room for a loose interpretation of Islam in Massina; there must be exact wording in our laws and strict adherence to what is outlined throughout the Quran and the Hadiths. Through our interpretation of Islam we will have a tighter grip on power and few will be able to question our authority without also raising questions about their own piety."
 regulated_use_niger_river_land: "Regulate Land Usage"
 regulated_use_niger_river_land_desc: "As part of our laws we firmly regulate the usage of land along the Niger River. This has resulted in a great rise in productive potential since people can use the land in a proper and organized manner instead of roaming about without clear boundaries. In time, we will see our profits increase when trade along the Niger River comes through to Massina."
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi: "The Guards of Hamdullahi"
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi_desc: "Hamdullahi is a significant city in Massina as it holds a great deal of cultural history to us. The guards of Hamdullahi, though undoubtedly changed at this point since their inception, still stand as a monument to our past and should be remembered for their stalwart attitude in defending Hamdullahi against invading forces. If we can instill this defensive mentality in more people, our defensive capabilities will be much better."
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development: "Strengthen Land Development"
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development_desc: "Through our laws on land development, more and more people are coming to our cities and communities to settle down and begin a new life of agriculture instead of living a pastoral and nomadic life. This has granted us advantages over time and allowed us to start developing our urban centers even further than before which we will certainly need to do as times continue to change around Massina."
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue: "The Seeds of Religious Dialogue"
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue_desc: "And as our urban centers grow, we will be attracting new religious scholars and preachers who interpret Islamic doctrine differently than we do. Instead of turning them away and persecuting all those who think differently from us, we can perhaps have some religious dialogue over time and open up specific centers of religious study so that we can refine our own interpretation of Islam alongside others."
 SOF_ideas: "Bamana Ideas"
 SOF_ideas_start: "Bamana Traditions"
 SOF_ideas_bonus: "Bamana Ambition"
 patrol_the_niger_river: "Patrol the Niger River"
 patrol_the_niger_river_desc: "The blood of an empire can be trade revenue, and for the Bamana state, trade along the Niger River is proving to be almost like blood for us. We must always be striving to make sure it is safe and secure so that not only can we profit from trade canoes going along its flowing streams, but so that we can profit from producing valuable crops alongside the banks of the river itself."
 subjugate_rival_chiefs: "Subjugate Internal Pretenders"
 subjugate_rival_chiefs_desc: "The pretenders to our throne and the ones who would see our power broken up are always on the lookout for weak spots in our state. We must have an active and capable military force that is ready to cut down insurgents whenever and wherever they rise up and, if it is even possible, before they rise up."
 the_komo_council: "The Komo Council"
 the_komo_council_desc: "The administration of Bamana is traditional in many ways. Our ancestors are revered all across our land throughout our court system and the komo, a body of advisors dedicated solely to theological matters, helps us conduct our worship to our ancestors correctly. Let us hope and pray for a better future that all of Bamana can partake in."
 the_slave_war_cycle: "The Slave-War Cycle"
 the_slave_war_cycle_desc: "Slaves and wars are consistent throughout West Africa and we are no different in relying on the continual slave-war cycle. Part of our economy and military rely on the capturing and trading around of slaves so it is only right that we become adept at manipulating this cycle to our advantage. The more calculated our war efforts are and if we can deal with slaves on a consistent basis, we'll see the populace become used to this cycle as well as the state itself."
 build_up_segu_cities: "Build up Bamana Cities"
 build_up_segu_cities_desc: "Our cities grow more and more as we continue to move on in the world, but how should we go about improving them over time? City planning is, after all, a key feature of a well-defined state and we of course are striving to be just that. Perhaps investing in Bamana architecture and engineering and promoting slave work for these endeavors would help bring a semblance of city planning to our land."
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors: "To Our Ancestors"
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors_desc: "The sculptures and altars we fashion for our long gone ancestors are finely made and well thought out. They have meaning in almost every detail and our administration rightly places a great emphasis on them being part of the centrality of our state since they represent such significant figures of our past. Promoting the fine crafting of these works of art and faithfulness should be something we always strive to do."
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods: "Improve Building Methods"
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods_desc: "The methods of building we obtained from the Songhai are more for building defensive structures and they have served us well so far. Continuing to develop these methods of constructing walls, garrisons, and defensive structures from the materials we have around us will help improve our defensive positions and provide more security to our people."
 YAO_ideas: "Yao Ideas"
 YAO_ideas_start: "Yao Traditions"
 YAO_ideas_bonus: "Yao Ambition"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan: "Fusion of Two Clans"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan_desc: "The inception of Yao came as a result of our nomadic ancestors coming into prolonged contact with Kanem Bornu's people. After this, a slow fusion of two clans happened, this being between the Kayi Clan and Ngizimis Kanembu Clan, and the result was the political entity of Yao. Tracing our heritage back to this pivotal period is what our people look up to time and time again, and we will always trace our lineage to back to that period."
 rivalry_versus_kanem: "The Lake Chad Rivalry"
 rivalry_versus_kanem_desc: "Lake Chad is fertile ground for food and growing states, but it is also fertile ground for conflict between Kanem Bornu and ourselves, the Sultanate of Yao. We've had ages of conflict before and we will continue to in the future if we neither of us win this prolonged state of hostility that has lasted for generations."
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks: "Facing Death Again"
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks_desc: "Though we once had the upper hand against Kanem Bornu in the late 1300s, those 5 leaders we killed in Kanem Bornu did not break down the power of our enemy completely. They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation. That moment in time taught our people that facing death in a war is something that will be frequent for Yao, and we will still fight with all we got no matter how close to death we are."
 caravans_toward_egypt: "Caravans Toward Egypt"
 caravans_toward_egypt_desc: "Because of our position in the eastern part of Lake Chat and toward the treacherous desert, and also because of our nomadic heritage from before we settled down, we have trade contacts throughout the eastern land and even toward the Nile River. The more trade we promote eastward toward the Nile River and ultimately toward Egypt, the better off we will be in terms of revenue."
 lake_chads_importance: "The Centrality of the Lake"
 lake_chads_importance_desc: "The lake by which we base our power around is significant to many people. The fertility it provides for crops and the fact that it is also a freshwater lake means that it can support a great amount of people and a great state surrounding it. The more finely we cultivate the land here, the more we will have in store for later on."
 nomadic_warfare_ways: "The Ways of the Nomads"
 nomadic_warfare_ways_desc: "Fighting as nomadic people is something few can master, especially when the fighting is along sand dunes and sparse savannah. Though we aren't nomads anymore, the leaders of Yao are versed in nomadic warfare and moving quickly around the field of war so that the enemy has little chance of catching a friendly army out in the open."
 season_of_bilala_conquest: "Season of Conquest"
 season_of_bilala_conquest_desc: "Once our conquest of around the lake is complete and the old traditions of the Kanem Bornu state are incorporated into the Sultanate of Yao, we will begin carving a new path for ourselves and the people around Lake Chad; we will be feared by others, instead of being subjugated by rival empires and kingdoms. There is no time to rest now, not when its the season of conquest for the Bilala people!"
 KOK_ideas: "Kokand Ideas"
 KOK_ideas_start: "Kokand Traditions"
 KOK_ideas_bonus: "Kokand Ambition"
 citadel_of_kokand: "The Citadel of Kokand"
 citadel_of_kokand_desc: "Kokand itself has been our starting point and the place from which we project power from. Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."
 tajik_mercenary_fighters: "Tajik Mercenaries"
 tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc: "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus: "In and Around the Oxus River"
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus_desc: "The Oxus River has been stage for a number of states that came before us and it has seen countless conquests from a variety of people. We are going to continue this tradition and conquer land just like our ancestors have, leaving fire and blood behind us as our people march forth, banner in one hand and musket in the other."
 the_khojas_of_kashgar: "The Kashgar Khojas"
 the_khojas_of_kashgar_desc: "Khojas (meaning 'master' in Persian) are people who are descedants of the Naqshabandi Sufi teacher named Amad Kasani (1461-1542). At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."
 preventing_civil_wars: "Prevent Collapses"
 preventing_civil_wars_desc: "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."
 unify_the_uzbek_people: "Uzbek Unity"
 unify_the_uzbek_people_desc: "Our kin that lie around the Aral Sea and west of the Tarim Basin, the Uzbek people, are rather disunited and longing for leadership that can tame their various clans. Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."
 a_settled_khanate: "Changing Times, Changing People"
 a_settled_khanate_desc: "We cannot deny that our traditions of khans and steppe riders are becoming outdated more and more. To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."
 colla_kingdoms_ideas: "Aymara Kingdom Ideas"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_start: "Aymara Kingdom Traditions"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_desc: "Aymara Kingdom Ambition"
 dualistic_governing_body: "Dualistic Governing Body"
 dualistic_governing_body_desc: "Much like other polities in the mountains we come from, our governing body is dualistic in its nature with both parts working together to govern the land in harmony but also recognizing that one side is superior to the other. Over time, we can reform this tradition into a more centralized version that still keeps true to what our ancestors set up in past ages."
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka: "Lake Titikaka Shrine"
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka_desc: "The shrine at Lake Titikaka is inhabited by our people and is held sacred by many people groups throughout the mountains and hills around us. Keeping its sanctity and keeping the land around the lake safe will help bring more faithful followers to our state."
 the_three_colla_people_groups: "Colla, Puquina, and Uro"
 the_three_colla_people_groups_desc: "The three main groups of people that make up the various cities and dominions of the Aymara people are the Colla, the Puquina, and the Uro. All three hold various amounts of power depending on what city you travel to and gaining the loyalty of all three is a must if we are to have a decent sized fighting force."
 contesting_the_mountain_territories: "Contest for the Mountains"
 contesting_the_mountain_territories_desc: "The mountains breed warfare unlike any other place around us since, even though the terrain might be rough and air might be thin, the will of the lords and kings to fight for power never ceases despite what happens. As we go forth, our people will become addept in mountain tactics and movements in and around hills to the point that we will be able to outdo any enemy that stands in our way."
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu: "Urcosuyu and Umasuyu"
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu_desc: "The two regions of Urcosuyu and Umasuyu are more so administrative divisions for us and are the basis by which we are reforming our laws of the land. By establishing these regions more firmly with inheritance laws and stronger local authorities, we will be able to develop the lands more more easily."
 earth_work_defenses: "Earthen Defenses"
 earth_work_defenses_desc: "Much like other people groups around us, the defenses of our land are made of earthen materials like stone and mud bricks. We can improve on this though, and work on how our fortifications are built from the ground up and in what ways they supported via supply routes and internal garrison structures."
 successor_to_tiwanaku: "Succeed Tiwanaku"
 successor_to_tiwanaku_desc: "The old polity of Tiwanaku that came before us, its memory has faded a great deal by now. Still, some traditions and tales live on from those olden times when Tiwanaku was around and in large part we are the only embodiment of a successor to Tiwanaku. If it falls to only us being around to succeed where they left off, then let us do so."
 NUP_ideas: "Nupe Ideas"
 NUP_ideas_start: "Nupe Traditions"
 NUP_ideas_bonus: "Nupe Ambition"
 times_of_rare_unification: "Rarely Unified"
 times_of_rare_unification_desc: "It seems like we are scattered and disunited throughout the ages and surrounding people groups take advantage of us whenever they can, but is there any hope of claiming unity amongst the Nupe people? Glimmers of light have shown this in the past, but still we remember the fighting and feuds that always brought down these hopes. Let us never forget the times of warfare before we were unified into our current state."
 etsu_nupe: "Etsu Nupe"
 etsu_nupe_desc: "The Etsu Nupe, or, King of the Nupe, is a title that has been claimed before and is claimed now, sure, but there must be solid backing behind it. We are consistently working on building up our base of power in terms of military potential, but at the same time we are working to solve age-old disputes our leader and his lineage may have with other Nupe clans and tribes."
 traditional_customs_with_islam: "To Share in Faith"
 traditional_customs_with_islam_desc: "We share many religious customs with several people groups around us, but this new faith called 'Islam' is increasingly coming forth to Nupe communities and their preachers seem intent on converting us. Whilst we will resist full conversion of this suspicious new religion, some of our friends and allies have taken up Islam and been completely fine with it; perhaps we could see what this faith has to offer us."
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede: "The Legacy of Tsoede"
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede_desc: "If there is one figure in Nupe history that we look up to, it is Tsoede, the great unifier of Nupe people. Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."
 assimilate_the_border_people: "Taking in the Border People"
 assimilate_the_border_people_desc: "There are a variety of people on our border as the border itself is not concrete; it is porous and can be freely passed through at times by a variety of people. Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits. Perhaps bringing our traditions and culture to them will help cement their fealty and loyalty to us and bring them closer to being true Nupe people."
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship: "The Power of Kin"
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship_desc: "Bringing together two different sides through the act of marriage is at times a great way to ease tensions and we of Nupe are keen on making sure these marriages go smoothly. Whether they are internal families who have feuds with us or foreign families who are potential allies, securing valuable marriages with a variety of people will spread the influence of the Nupe far and wide."
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest: "Clashes against Islam"
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest_desc: "Islam may have its good parts and may be somewhat present in Nupe lands, but there are political entities that take Islam to the worst degree possible and wage war against us in the name of it. We will not stand by and watch our fields burn and men die in vain, no, we will rally against these unjust wars and fight back with all that we can."

 SPA_NAV_ideas_bonus: "Spanish Ambition"
 spa_influences_of_catholicism: "Catholic Roots"
 spa_influences_of_catholicism_desc: "Catholicism in Iberia, there almost nothing that is quite as natural as this, and with the fires of the Protestant Reformation making Europe a pool of different forms of Christianity that turn away from the one true faith, Iberia is perhaps the only bastion of righteous Catholicism left. This will not break our spirit, but rather it will embolden us to do more in the name of Christ and the Holy See!"
 spa_high_seas_fleet: "Armada of the Spanish"
 spa_high_seas_fleet_desc: "Iberia has had to deal with coastal raids and threats form the sea for centuries and it has taught the various people of the peninsula to build up what naval forces they can to combat foreigners intruding on their land. Whether they be Portuguese sailors, Castilian admirals, Aragonese builders, or even Galician cartographers, we will ensure that every single part of our future armada will be specifically built to uphold the coastal integrity of Spain."
 spa_strong_colonial_authority: "The Watchful Eyes of Spain"
 spa_strong_colonial_authority_desc: "Our subjects, be they viceroys, small dukes, or local governors, know that the Spanish crown is always keen on hearing them out for what they need and what they have to say. Listening to what our subjects need is crucial to keeping them loyal, but we must also watch their every action that we possibly can should a corrupt subject attempt to collude with the enemies of Spain. There will be none who evade our watchful eyes."
 spa_tercio_reformation: "Reformation of the Tercios"
 spa_tercio_reformation_desc: "The tercios of old were innovative when they were first introduced, but as time has gone on there have been innovations in various fields that have allowed foreign infantry and cavalry to take out our tercios. Reformation is needed on the surface of things, and not only this but new tactics revolving around new technology must be integrated with our tercios if Spain is every going to be a true and proper military power."
 por_feitorias: "Promote Feitorias"
 por_feitorias_desc: "From our formative days as Portugal to where we are now as Spain, the feitorias around the world for us have been nothing but grand for goal of making more money through trade. Increasing the amount built and perhaps even converting a few into actual Spanish trading colonies could yield untold amounts of benefits for us as well."
 por_marines: "Spanish Marines"
 por_marines_desc: "The days as Portugal taught out soldiers that attacking coastal settlements from ships is something that takes time and training to master. Being a marine in the Spanish military is nothing short of an honor as it signifies that they are truly ready to be on the front of Spain's wars and colonies, fighting from coast to coast in order to secure what is rightfully ours."
 por_trade_monopolies: "Monopolized"
 por_trade_monopolies_Desc: "There is only one power that can make more money from trade than we can and that power is Venice, but they are locked into the Mediterranean Sea whilst we of Spain are free to take our interests beyond the shores of the inland sea. We will monopolize what markets we can in the world and ensure that Spanish trade interests satisfied by our merchants."
 cas_the_inquisition: "The Spanish Inquisition!"
 cas_the_inquisition_desc: "Whether through promises of salvation, sending a few spare coins their way, or making them feel the pain that Christ felt when he was on the cross, the Spanish Inquisition will work to enforce the Catholic faith throughout Spain and its holdings. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition to come forth and bring unity to the masses, but they will indeed do this through the power of righteous faith and sanctioned methods."
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos: "Reformation of the Cabildos"
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos_desc: "Though the cabildo may be used to help represent the various land owners in a certain province, it is routinely vulnerable to corruption via the people running it since they are more or less governors of an entire area away from central Spanish authority. We must work to reform the cabildos into a stronger institution that can represent the various Spanish people properly and without colored glasses shaping what we see beneath the cabildo."
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people: "Every Continent, a Spanish Flag"
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people_desc: "Some would say that the Spanish people are spilling into whatever land they can for the sake of spreading out, but this is a simplistic way of seeing our endeavors. In reality, we strive to influence what politics we can in the favor of Spanish interests, and part of doing that means colonizing lands all across the world with strong Spanish communities."
 ara_mercenary_princes: "Princely Mercenaries"
 ara_mercenary_princes_desc: "Aragonese roots bring with them a plethora of mercenary connections as our past princes have been made to lead various mercenary companies both in and out of Iberia. Though we are steadily cutting down on how many mercenaries we use, these ties to various mercenary companies could indeed be useful for us in the future if Spain is in a tight spot."
 ara_charter_companies: "Charter Companies of Spain"
 ara_charter_companies_desc: "Why must we colonize everything with valuable Spanish families when we can instead cultivate our interests through charter companies that are supported by our military at times? Surely this method of expanding Spanish influence will bring about increased profit for us later on and few will be able to resist the pull of Spanish markets."
 ara_centralized_estates: "Command the Spanish Estates"
 ara_centralized_estates_desc: "As for what can be done with Spanish land directly underneath the crown... Well, unruly estates must be put back in line, should they not? For too long we have seen the clergy and the nobility run their own local affairs without Spanish interests being at their heart which has led to various struggles for power that boil upwards to the monarch. It is time we take firm control over these estates and make them bow to the Spanish crown once and for all."
 lon_the_true_iberian: "Truth in our Blood"
 lon_the_true_iberian_desc: "The people of Leon and those of Leonese descent know that they are indeed the true holders of Iberia and were destined to be as such had it not been for the fiends of Castile stealing power away from the leaders of Leon. Now that we are unified with the true blood of the Leonese leading the way, there will very few who can question our authority."
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect: "The Leonese Dialect"
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect_desc: "Much like how the Castilians slowly spread their dialect throughout their lands, Leonese will now spread throughout the land we hold and steadily assimilate other languages into it. Perhaps in the future, we can even form a foundation of sorts dedicated to keeping our language enforced without much change over time."
 lon_schools_of_iberia: "Schools of Iberia"
 lon_schools_of_iberia_desc: "To further promote the intellectual pursuits of Spanish people and to keep them on par with the likes of the rest of Europe, we must be keen on building libraries, schools, and universities all across Iberia. Basic literacy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, and science must all be taught to our people if we wish to strengthen ourselves internally."
 gal_santiago_de_compostela: "Santiago de Compostela in Galicia"
 gal_santiago_de_compostela_desc: "The city of Santiago de Compostela, grand is it not? Holding the fabeled Way of St. James's ending, the city is very much a pilgramage site for Catholics around Europe and it has led to a great deal of zealousness amongst our missionaries and priests. We need to keep them reined in as time goes on, but their zeal should not be left to wither away in our lands; they can safely promote the faith in our own land when it is needed."
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia: "The Bishoprics of Iberia"
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia_desc: "The bishoprics were once a key factor in the politics of Iberia and at times, clergy officials could easily hold sway over certain parts of kingdoms and duchies. The time has come to centralize power toward the crown of Spain, but we can still find use in these old bishoprics when it comes to hiring good leaders to help organize our military. They had experience with doing such in centuries past, why can't they help us out now?"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion: "The Rightous Bastion"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion_desc: "The Spanish people are and have always been righteous defenders of Catholicism throughout their time on the peninsula as independent entities. From the times of Asturias and Galicia to the times of Portugal and Aragon, our people have been loyal to the one true faith, garnering us a rather fitting reputation as a defender of the faith."
 cat_luxury_of_iberia: "Luxuries of Iberia"
 cat_luxury_of_iberia_desc: "Iberia is full of luxury goods if one can search for them in the right markets and the right communities. Places like Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza should be promoted to higher standings in Spanish land so that they can truly become the epitome of an empire taking in all the trade Europe has to offer."
 cat_harbor_emphasis: "Emphasize the Harbors"
 cat_harbor_emphasis_desc: "The various harbors of Iberia are alright for now, but they need to be built up even further later on if we are to compete with the likes of the French, the English, and the Italians! Catalan cities on the coast are perhaps some of the best for building ships and promoting naval interests for Spain so those should be prioritized first, and then harbors around the rest of Iberia should be focused on."
 cat_mercantile_expertise: "Mercnatile Lens on the World"
 cat_mercantile_expertise_desc: "Emphaisis on our Catalan heritage makes us more keen on trade and naval dominance as one might expect. The glistening cities of Barcelona and Valencia are what we should be striving to make throughout all Spanish lands, and within these cities shall be grand markets that have trade power on levels the Venetians and Genoese could only dream of."
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders: "Cross-Region Traders"
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders_desc: "The Basque people are a strange sort of people in Iberia, but they're influential in mercantile politics as well as dynastic politics. These Basque connections in the French region and the in the lands of the English and Irish could be just the thing that Spain needs to profit hugely, though it will take time to ensure these connections are solid enought to build on."
 nav_blending_of_iberian_identities: "Edicts of Acceptance"
 nav_blending_of_iberian_identities_desc: "If Castilians and Leonese people can accept the Basque people into the Iberian fold, there isn't any reason why they wouldn't be able to accept others into the fold as well. The Basque language alone is enough to put off many people as it is radically different to any language around it, but seeing as it is a key facet of Spanish culture as a whole, perhaps people are becoming more accepting as time goes on."
 nav_importing_ideas: "Import Foreign Ideas"
 nav_importing_ideas_desc: "Foreigners can be met with suspicion in Spanish lands, but they shouldn't be put off forever. As time goes on, we'll foster a more diplomatically open and cordial attitude in the Spanish people. Even though they might be staunchly Catholic in their ways, culturally they can be accepting, and foreign ideas should not be much of an issue if the ideas can indeed be a benefit to our society as a whole."

 plc_prosperous_folwarks_desc: "A nobleman's landholding in the Commonwealth is usually comprised of what we call a folwark. It is a large farm worked by various serfs to produce surpluses for trade that is both internal and external. So long as we can keep this system functional and perhaps reform the laws surrounding it over time, the folwark system will continue to contribute great amounts to our trade routes and our stockpiles."
 pol_jagiellonian_university: "Jagiellonian University"
 pol_jagiellonian_university_desc: "Established in 1364, Krakow's Jagiellonian University is perhaps one of the greatest places in all of Europe! It has brought in, taught, and cultivated a variety of philosophical and scientific minds the likes of which Europe could almost never live without, let alone the Polish and Lithuanian people. Going forth, Jagiellonian University will continue to be one of the brightest points in our grand Commonwealth."
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna: "Obrona Potoczna"
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna_desc: "What we term a 'continuous defense' is really a standing army that is paid for by the monarch from their own pocket. They are stationed traditionally in troubled areas or places where the border with a neighbor is not clearly defined so that Commonwealth interests are not intruded upon. Over time, this military sector of ours is going to yield for us highly trained soldiers and skilled generals who know just how to deal with enemies of all types, whether they're of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukranian, or foreign descent."
 pol_winged_hussars: "And the Winged Hussars Arrived!"
 pol_winged_hussars_desc: "As Europe moves from heavy cavalry to light cavalry, the Polish troops of the Commonwealth know that heavy cavalry are still very much able to deal great amounts of damage in battle if they are led correctly and armed with proper equipment. We will focus our efforts on cultivating the Winged Hussars as much as we can and build our military tactics around how the heavy cavalry should perform in battle."
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty: "Refinement of Golden Liberty"
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty_desc: "Our political doctrine: 'Our State is a republic under the presidency of the king'. It is by this statement that we abide by and the following aspects: having an election of a king by all nobles, a Sejm, a Pacta Conventa, religious freedom, legal right to rebel against a king who has violated guaranteed freedoms, liberum veto, and forming an organization to force a common political aim. By keeping these aspects of our republic enshrined and also refining them with new laws and legislation as we go forth, the Commonwealth will never become outdated nor stagnant in its politics."
 pol_royal_guards: "The Polish Royal Guards"
 pol_royal_guards_desc: "Responsibly directly for the protection of the monarch and his family, the Polish Royal Guards are set to be the peak of Commonwealth power. Fitted with the best equipment we can obtain and trained in a variety of methods throughout their lives, the Polish Royal Guards will only embolden and harden our military in the future, especially our infantry, all whilst keeping the monarch and his family safe from harm."
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors: "Tempered by Neighbors"
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors_desc: "All around us there is conflict. Swedish people? Baltic conflicts. Hungarians? Border disputes. Teutons? Old grudges and lusts for land. Russians? Ambition for land on both sides. Time and time again we have been tested in combat since our borders in the east and west are hard to define beyond a hand-drawn map, but these times of war did not break down the Polish and Lithuanian people, it only made them stronger."
 lit_success_after_success: "Success after Success"
 lit_success_after_success_desc: "The history of the Lithuanian people is vast and expansive as it is, and our history as an independent state pushing eastward has been something of a great success story. Being unscathed by Mongol attacks and actually beating them back, and then later on diplomatically annexing or invading and taking over various small Slavic states, it is all part of how good of a state we have cultivated over the centuries."
 lit_vilnius_university: "Vilnius University"
 lit_vilnius_university_desc: "Vilnius has been a hub of Lithuanian culture and grandeur for centuries now (Grand Duke Gediminas relocated the capital to Vilnius in 1323), so it is only fitting that we start up a grand university inside of it! Vilnius University will become a beacon for Lithuanian people and will serve to help bring scholars of all fields to the lands of the Commonwealth regardless of their faith."
 lit_develop_eastward: "Develop Eastward"
 lit_develop_eastward_desc: "The eastern portions of our land are full of open tracts of land that are ripe for development, but the people there are few and far between. We must subsidize these areas and begin to develop them into proper voidoeships so that they can not only contribute more taxs and manpower to the Commonwealth, but also help contribute to a stronger defensive line should any invasion come through those lands."

 legacy_of_the_antipopes_desc: "Previously, when the Papacy was in a state of chaos due to where the seat of Papal power was to be set at, two bishops of Parma became Antipopes. Honorius II (in opposition to Pope Alexander II) and Clement III (in opposition to Pope Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II) give Parma a legacy of partial Papal power that we should utilize whenever we can, and perhaps in the future, we should look into either usurping the Papacy for ourselves or lessening its central power from Rome itself."
 family_possessions_of_parma: "Family Obligations of Possessions"
 family_possessions_of_parma_desc: "Fiefs and holdings owned by various noble families in Parma are somewhat decentralized, not obeying every law from our central government, but they have their own benefits due to this method of governance. They pay for the upkeep in their own holdings and they also know that since Parma is in such a contested spot of the Italian Peninsula, there will need to be a great many defenders for each property they own. Let us hope that they hire men of quality instead of levying each peasant they see."
 heart_of_the_italian_wars: "Heart of the Italian Wars"
 heart_of_the_italian_wars_desc: "Parma is not known for being a strong military power, that is a fact, but it is also a fact that Parma is a great witness to the various Italian wars that rage on between Germanic, French, and Italian people. Parma must not just watch the blood spill on the floor in shock and horror, no, it must learn from the clashes of these various forces and attempt to cultivate some sort of refined military force as time goes on."
 university_and_nobles_college: "Ensuring Quality Education"
 university_and_nobles_college_desc: "We must see to it that the Parmigianos are taken care of with the best we can provide. We do not look to having a sprawling empire like the French or Spanish, we instead look to having a bustling urban center and a cultivated city full of educated and well rounded citizens. To promote our work in this area, we should certainly strive to have universities and colleges throughout Parma despite what financial costs they might incur."
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons: "Power Adjustments"
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons_desc: "Just as Parma progresses in its work to build a fine central city with a myriad of scholars and artisans living within it, Parma will need to enforce most strict laws and pass more defined legislation that outlines what rights and powers certain groups of people have. In accordance with this, adjusting the power of barons and noble families is a must, but we will not completely do away with them. If we were to cut them out entirely, Parma might face a revolt that could bring down all the prosperity it has built up so far."
 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas: "The Future of Ideas"
 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas_desc: "Our strive to educate our own people and to emphasize our importance in our local area of the Italian Peninsula has been met with opposition throughout, but the opposition has only given life to new ideas! The schools of thought we foster are to be marveled at since they are giving Parmigiano people new perspectives on life, administration, taxation, trade, diplomacy, and almost every other aspect of life and statecraft one could think of!"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas: "Parma is Prepared"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas_desc: "It is thanks to our will to educate our people and our willingness to confront new ideas head on that Parma is where it is. Few can doubt the quality of our schools, and fewer still can doubt how many scholars of great quality our universities give rise to. What must be done now is to spread this slowly rising standard of education toward all parts of Parmigiano society."

 the_diocese_of_passau_desc: "As the successor to the Diocese of Lorch, we of Passau are endowed with power and authority but only in a limited area as of today. Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries. This reputation will only serve to enhance the trust we have from our own people, and it will help pave the way for a bright future in Passau."
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf: "Stamp of the Wolf"
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf_desc: "If there is one matter that Passau is becoming known for as the Age of Exploration makes its way across the Old World, it is that bladed weapon manufacturing is a key component of Passau's prosperity! Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the blade has come from. These high quality weapons may not be the best against muskets but they do inspire a great many stories of heroism amongst those who use them, especially the soldiers of our own ranks."
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau: "Inviting Religious Orders"
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau_desc: "To help spread the good word of Passau to other parts of Europe, we should be willing to invite in various high-ranking officials from the holy orders around Europe. Franciscans, Dominicans, even Jesuits would be fitting to invite to our land so that in the future, we may attract future theologians, philosophers, artists, and other skilled people of various professions."
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau: "Heresy! Everywhere!"
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation does not waver in its effort to bring about ruin and destruction across the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself. Passau is caught in the middle of these violent clashes and will need to choose a side before one side enforces its religious demands upon the other in our own land."
 who_should_rule_over_passau: "A Powerful Question to Passau"
 who_should_rule_over_passau_desc: "Who can rule over Passau is not an easy question to answer as some think they should be elected from a religious background instead of a meritocratic background. There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna: "The Rival Diocese"
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna_desc: "Vienna is so beloved by the Austrians and Papacy that it got its own diocese... How wonderful... Though some rejoice that Vienna got this attention, we of Passau resent it greatly! The ecclesiastic power of Vienna partly comes at a cost of our ecclesiastic power! The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us. After all is done, the various deacons and priests and other holy officials that would've gone to Vienna can instead come to Passau, as they always should have done."
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence: "The Taste of Power"
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence_desc: "We have tasted power in the past and as of late, though we are not in a strong position to challenge strong states around us. Even to defend ourselves, the forces of Passau are rather small and weak, ineffective at stopping any advance from neighboring princes that might be eager to dismantle our power. Taking measures to formalize and build up the military potential of Passau should be a steady project for all inside our borders."

 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart: "Residence at Rotenburg Castle"
 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart_desc: "Established in about 1195, Rotenburg Castle has remained the residency for the Prince-Bishops of Verden since its inception. It serves as a status symbol and a good defensive structure to protect Verden from any ambitious ruler of Bremen, Luneburg, or some other state, though we must always keep in mind that the castle needs to be reworked and updated as time goes on."
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have: "The Fine Lines of Religious Power"
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have_desc: "Papal power in the far north is not as strong as it used to be as fissures within the Catholic faith are emerging as time goes on. We of Verden must choose a path in the near future and outline specifically where the boundaries of religious authority are since it is clear to all that religion mixing into international politics is causing more divides and more lives to be lost."
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen: "Love-Hate Relations with Bremen"
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen_desc: "At times we have ruled in tandem with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, but these unions were never true personal unions of any sort. Rather, the relations between Bremen and Verden have been quite hostile at times since Bremen has more foundational power and thus more ambition. We should at least use the good relations we do have with Bremen to hire more skilled courtiers so that we of Verden can benefit from the times of peace between the two states."
 provisions_of_being_immediate: "Advantages of Imperial Immediacy"
 provisions_of_being_immediate_desc: "Much like how Bremen is of imperial immediacy, Verden has this status in much the same way. It yields a great amount of benefits for both of us, though we take it in a different direction than they do since we are more focused on building up internally instead of controlling a myriad of religious territories and such. Being of imperial immediacy will in fact attract highly skilled advisors to Verden that will be able to grant us a great amount of influence in the future."
 politics_of_the_circles: "Intricate Holy Roman Politics"
 politics_of_the_circles_desc: "The Imperial Circles are administrative groupings in the Holy Roman Empire that serve to organize common defenses and collect taxes from the land. They also help organize the Imperial Diet when it convenes, and Verden being part of one of these circles means it can step up into higher level politics as compared to what it can normally get into. Experience with these administrative groupings will help refine our diplomatic sector and also serve to help us learn about the intricacies of foreign affairs."
 controlling_verdens_politics: "Protection of Internal Cohesion"
 controlling_verdens_politics_desc: "We have worked hard to ensure that our political situation internally isn't threatened by massive unrest or foreign dynasties. Though some dynasties remain prominent in Verden and some groups of people try to sway things in a single, unilateral way, our Prince-Bishop and those close to him are always working to ensure that these efforts to thwart our stability and infiltrate our state are fended off."
 slow_acquisition_of_power: "Keep Verden Growing"
 slow_acquisition_of_power_desc: "We strive to grow in a number of ways and we are always seeking to accomadate people within our borders though some would think that our efforts are not enough for those that aren't of strict Verdian descent. Working on understanding the differences and being tolerant of differences of new people coming into our fold will help Verden prosper and become less of a center of unrest... We can let Bremen handle that sort of tension..."

Rupert of Salzburg did good in his foundational days of starting such a magnificent structure for the heirs to his power, and now we today should do as previous rulers of Salzburg have done: keep it in the best possible condition no matter what happens."
 to_side_with_the_holy_see: "History of Papal Sidings"
 to_side_with_the_holy_see_desc: "Various controversies have rocked the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries and Salzburg, being so close to Austria whilst being a Prince-Archbishopric, has had to take sides in the various disputes. We tend to side with the Holy See and see them as the rightful powers in these political arguments which gives a degree of positive reputation with fellow Catholics, and keeping to this honesty will only help Salzburg's reputation grow in the future."
 the_notion_of_a_diet: "Convene the Diet of Salzburg"
 the_notion_of_a_diet_desc: "Despite being a Prince-Archbishopric, we cannot live without the usual institutions of a standard state. Merchants, peasants, knights and officers, and also clergy are spread throughout Salzburg and have their own interests aside from what we in the administration want. In order to help sort out these desires, we should look to convene some sort of diet for all of Salzburg so that we can better align all parts of the state toward common goals."
 choices_for_salzburgs_people: "The Choice of Faith"
 choices_for_salzburgs_people_desc: "There are those in Salzburg who think that the Protestant Reformation will bring about its destruction what with the violence spreading and the politics becoming all the more murky as time goes on. We know this is not the truth, but we cannot deny that times will be hard for our population all around. The time has come for those of Salzburg to make the choice on what their faith for the future will be."
 university_of_salzburg: "University of Salzburg"
 university_of_salzburg_desc: "Rebuilding from the mess of religious struggles is going to be difficult, but not impossible. Starting off with a university to attract both local and international scholars and theologians will help bring Salzburg back to life whilst also building its characteristic faithfulness back up to where it once was."
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class: "Clergy over Merchants"
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class_desc: "The time has come for stricter regulations to come over the merchants and burghers of Salzburg. Though we understand they have needs that Salzburg needs to address as time goes on, they bring with them more corruption and foreign interference than actual ducats into our treasury. Letting the clergy and peasants handle things will be much better for Salzburg later on."
 militarized_prince_bishopric: "Extend our Temporal Control"
 militarized_prince_bishopric_desc: "Though we are limited partially by our spiritual characteristic bestowed upon us by the Holy See, the influence of the Holy See is not as strong as it once was. We can slowly begin to take military matters into our own hands and start creating a strong military for ourselves. Perhaps even doing conquests in our own name instead of the name of the Papacy? Well, we shall see how far that goes, but we are optimistic!"

 buffer_state_of_north_and_south_desc: "Our small state has been called a buffer state of sorts between the rival leaders to the north and south. Though the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States may fight over the fate of Italy's northern portion, we of Modena are a sort of balancing factor that help bolster stability between the two influential giants. Such a status is enviable by other states since we are in essence a necessary political entity that must be had around."

Long will Modena stand and long will be look toward the future!"

 prestige_inside_modena_desc: "Scholars from all across Europe are travelling far and wide, bringing their prestige and luxury wherever they go. If we can build ourselves up internally and fund the construction of some high-class educational facilities, Modena will be able to foster its own prestigious scholarly class of people."
 tangled_in_italian_politics: "Tangled in Italian Politics"
 tangled_in_italian_politics_desc: "Being in the Italian Peninsula means we are also subject to the many intricacies of Italian politics. Places such as Venice, Siena, Roma, Lucca, Genoa, and Milan all push and pull on the various political ropes found throughout the peninsula and of Modena are adding to this in the same way that they do. It is time we invest honest time and effort into working out who are the friends and enemies of Modena before we become an unfortunate victim in these lands."

 engineering_for_success_desc: "The efforts to build up Modena's internal structures has resulted in a great number of engineers and builders who are adept at capturing the exact details in luxury and functionality that we of Modena both want and need.

 alpine_trade_rites_desc: "The mountains that divide the Italian Peninsula from the rest of Europe are rough to pass through, especially when snow blocks several passages, but Tirol is a path that can be traversed with some ease. This simple fact has made Tirol a valuable trade stop for those who wish to cross the mountains and as such makes taxing trade that comes through our land a natural thing. Safe passage is something that should always be valued!"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong: "Tirol Castle"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong_desc: "With the first castle being built before 1100, the second phase of construction happening in 1139-1140, and the final construction taking place in the late 1200s under Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tirol, this castle has served as the central piece of power for Tirol. Without it, we would not be as significant as we are nor as hard to invade. If we are to continue being a strong force in the mountain passes well into the future, it would serve us well to preserve our castle to the best extent possible."
 winter_advantages: "A Friend of Winter"
 winter_advantages_desc: "Have you ever tried to cross these moutains in the winter on foot or on horseback? Both are equally terrible endeavors and many have died trying to do one or the other for military or civilian purposes. We of Tirol know the perils of these mountains all too well and thus make it so that the winter snows work for our defensive plans instead of against our general military strategies. We will see if our enemies are dull enough to fall face first into the mountain of snow they'll face."
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol: "Silver Linings"
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol_desc: "The silver mine of Tirol is perhaps the second half of our great importance to surrounding states. Minting coins and making luxury goods from silver is valued all across Europe and thus, business is always present for Tirol. When the opportunity to improve the method of mining out this silver is around, we will be the first to take it up without question."
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers: "The Winter Soldiers"
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers_desc: "Tiroler troops can become some of the hardiest troops in all of Europe, they only need to be trained in such a way that they can withstand freezing temperatures and harsh terrain. Traditionally we have had no need to do this but as politics begin to change around us, we need to start thinking about how we will defend ourselves from neighboring states. How do we do this? Well, it all starts with our military, does it not?"
 italian_or_german_are_we: "The Fine Lines of Diplomacy"
 italian_or_german_are_we_desc: "Tirol has a history of being intertwined with a number of dynasties which serves to both help and hinder Tirol itself. It can allow Tirol to ease tensions and get into fine diplomatic deals at times, but it can also make for the seat of power in Tirol to be claimed by a foreign state should things go wrong. Let us play our cards as best we can and navigate this political hall-of-mirrors carefully."
 natural_experts_in_finance: "Balance the Scales"
 natural_experts_in_finance_desc: "With our diplomacy secure and our military in a fine shape, finances are where our focuses will go to next. The scales of our economy have been balanced around the grand silver mine in our land, but it won't last forever unfortunately. Thankfully the money and inflation that it has caused for us has helped make Tiroler officials adept financiers over the decades, so as we adjust our financial prospects in the future, any economic downturns will affect us in a less significant way."

Yet our legacy lives on from when we were able to contest for this very title in the late 800s and even obtaining it for a short while with Lambert I and Lambert II of Spoleto. Though this historical light behind us is faint, we will use it as much as we possibly can to stake claims on the land around us, conquering what is rightfully belonging to those of Spoleto."

 the_gift_of_spoleto_desc: "What do you want this Christmas season? Is it a new train set? A nice sweater? Well how about control over Spoleto as a Christmas gift? Indeed this was somewhat the case of the centuries from about the 900s to the 1000s as Spoleto was repeatedly 'gifted' to either the Papacy or other significant political players. Though we're not going to sell ourselves out like this, being so highly valued in the past and right now has its perks."
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy: "Italian Crossings"
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy_desc: "Spoleto itself is situated in a rather 'non-fertile' part of the Italian Peninsula and as such has had to contend with crossing hills for many years now. It builds up leg muscles in the short-term and helps build up effective means of navigating rough terrain in the long-term, the latter of which we are going to need for our troop movements in the future."
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto: "Unshaken Religious Convictions"
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto_desc: "Given where Spoleto is politically and how tumultuous the religious landscape in Europe is, it would be quite the piece of news to hear that Spoleto was uprooted from its ancestral faith. It is clear that the road ahead for us must truly be that of the Catholic Church as our loyalty to the church has been unshaken for many centuries, but if our faith truly does change for something else, it must mean that new faith has a truly monumental truth or truths, no?"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy: "Loan Our Sword; Lend Your Sword"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy_desc: "Like many other states in the Italian Peninsula, we of Spoleto are well versed in the notion of mercenaries. We loan out our troops to others for a fine bit of coinage, they lend us their swords in exchange for a few bags of coin, it's all a regular thing here. The more we deal in this area of warfare, the more Spoleto will benefit from it later on."
 learn_from_the_papacy: "Teachings of the Holy See"
 learn_from_the_papacy_desc: "We should not just simply let the Papal States be a nice ally or a static rival of ours in the Italian Peninsula, especially since we have plenty of history with the Papal States via being under direct papal rule with a proper cardinal as governor. If we can uphold what we've learned from our years of being a papal fiefdom, then we will be able to make others bend to our will in similar ways that the Papacy does."

 an_old_catholic_see_desc: "Since centuries ago, after the Wendish Crusade, our small bit of land has been home to the Ruppiner See. Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names. If we can project its claims out further, we'll be sure to have an easier time expanding without repurcussions."
 redo_our_town_walls: "New Town Walls"
 redo_our_town_walls_desc: "As old as our town is (alongside Neuruppin), the town walls erected around our central place of authority are not what they used to be. We should work on rebuilding them and constructing new defensive structures with high quality materials so that our defensive garrisons have a better chance at surviving incoming sieges."
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation: "Hefty Religious Consequences"
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness: "Between the Elbe and Oder River"
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc: "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently. Clearing some forests out of the way and harnessing some irrigation for our farms in a more efficient manner would do wonders for the productivity of Ruppin as a whole."
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims: "A Place of Claims"
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims_desc: "Being part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg for as long as we have, and also seeing how many conflicts have erupted between Brandenburg and its neighbors like Saxony, Ruppiner officials know that the land we stand on it a land of claims and of strategic value. Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."
 local_minded_officials: "Knowing our People"
 local_minded_officials_desc: "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet: "The Folks of Ruppin"
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet_dec: "We are not thought of as a militaristic place at all, but rather as a place of rural localities and small-time merchants and officials. Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 welf_pieces: "Welf Dynastic Pieces"
 welf_pieces_desc: "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg: "The Vogtei of Calenberg"
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg_desc: "Traditionally, the title of 'advocatus' ('vogt' and 'vogtei' in Old High German) was given to those who were legally delegated to carry out some secular responsibilities of a feudal lord or insitution. This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle: "Expand Calenberg Castle"
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle_desc: "Built by Otto the Strict in 1292, Calenberg Castle has served as our place of central authority for decades upon decades now. Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from. If we renovate it and fortify it thoroughly over time, few will be able to break through its walls and threaten our power."
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald: "Oberwald and Unterwald Development"
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc: "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."
 religious_issues_brought_home: "And it Followed me Home..."
 religious_issues_brought_home_desc: "We didn't ask for the Protestant Reformation to disturb our towns and citizens, but it followed our clergy and devote people home... Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg: "The Defense of Calenberg's Towns"
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg_desc: "The various petty wars that are waged all across the Holy Roman Empire are usually nothing to note of by bigger powers like Saxony or Austria, but to Calenberg, these wars pose as threats and learning opportunities. If we can learn to fortify our towns effectively and train more local militia groups to fight back against incoming invaders, fewer and fewer enemies will dare encroach on our land for fear of what resistance they will face on the local level."
 contest_for_northern_power: "A Worthy Contestant"
 contest_for_northern_power_desc: "The lands to the north in the Holy Roman Empire are rife with surges and drops in power from various electors, princes, and bishoprics. Calenberg is part of this cycle and is proving to many in the north that it is capable of fending for itself and even becoming a true stronghold. Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

 ACH_ideas_bonus: "Achaean Ambition"
 military_elite_amidst_greeks: "Military Elite Authority"
 military_elite_amidst_greeks_desc: "The Principality of Achaea was not greek in its founding at all, but rather it was state set up by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin in 1205 during the Fourth Crusade. Because of this foundation and how the entire principality was structured, it was clear to all from the outset that Achaea would be a French military elite ruling over a mostly Greek populace. This comes with its risks and rewards though, ranging from potential hostilities from the Greek people themselves to knowing just how to deal with rebellious people when they rise up."
 secular_baronies_of_achaea: "The 12 Baronies of Achaea"
 secular_baronies_of_achaea_desc: "Shortly after our founding, William of Champlitte (the first Prince of Achaea) sought to flesh out a proper administration over the land. He did this in 1208-1209 when he created a commission chaired by himself and also composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets, and five Greek magnates. This commission assessed the land and divided it up as best they could but perhaps the most stand-out aspect of this commission's work was the creation 12 secular baronies. Though we have had to adjust these baronies as time has gone on and perhaps the number fluctuates up or down as we see fit, they allow for a more efficient way of taxing our citizens."
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies: "The Prince's Relation to the Baronies"
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies_desc: "In Achaea, we do not see the prince as being ruling with absolute authority like some other states do, but rather the prince is the 'first among equals' when it comes to his relation to the baronies of Achaea. In this respect, the baronies of our land can construct castles and hand out capital punishment as they see fit whilst also serving the prince in the field and garrison for portions of the year. Alongside this, women could inherit fiefs inside of Achaea due to the laws not being entirely based upon Salic Law, thus offering a slightly wider array of people available to our court."
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict: "Violent Clashes between East and West"
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict_desc: "Founded in the midst of the Fourth Crusade and seeing our own demise in the fires of dynastic conflict and the struggles of the Byzantines, we of Achaea know exactly what fighting between eastern people and western people is like. Achaea itself has had to adapt to these prospects over the decades through constructing new castles, allying certain states, or purely learning to fight with more heart and more discipline. It is this last aspect that we must cultivate most of all though since we are in such a precarious position, for if we cannot rely on proper defenses or worthy allies, we must defend the land with our bodies and weapons alone."
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania: "The Great Court; Assizes of Romania"
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania_desc: "All secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council known as the 'Grand Court', which was and still is headed by the prince. It has a large amount of authority in Achaea and its decisions are binding not only to the people below the prince, but also to the prince himself. On top of this Grand Court, the Assizes of Romania were produced between the 1200s and 1400s whilst our principality was still alive and well despite dynastic claims hampering things. The Assizes of Romania helped blend Byzantine laws with French law and has helped Achaea and other Greek polities achieve a modicum stability with regards to laws of the land."
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin: "Emulate William II Villehardouin"
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin_desc: "Perhaps the greatest prince Achaea ever had, William II (reigned: 1246 - 1278) was French in descent by highly cultured in regards to almost every aspect about him. Not only was he a prince who desired land and rightfully obtained it through the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnese, he was a poet and a troubadour who achieved a flourishing literary culture within the court of Achaea itself. Though he became embroiled in the politics of the Byzantines and the other small states around in the 1200s, his legacy lives on within us and it is our duty to carry on his legacy of both a vibrant court and a grand vision of conquest combined with literacy."
 dynastic_claims_everywhere: "The Mess of Dynastic Claims"
 dynastic_claims_everywhere_desc: "The fall of the Principality of Achaea in the early part of the 1400s was the result of dynastic claims tearing away at our insides and also the then strong Despotate of Morea taking advantage of the turmoil occurring. We may have been fated to die a sorrowful death back then, but we are much stronger now compared to back then and we can capitalize on these dynastic feuds in this current age as opposed to how futile we were when various dynasties from across Europe sought out our land through inheritance or conquest."

 versus_the_crusaders: "Morea vs. Achaea"
 versus_the_crusaders_desc: "When the Frankish Principality of Achaea conquered southward under Prince William II Villehardouin, they lost at the Battle of Pelagonia against Michael VIII Palaelogus and the enemy prince was captured. Such a valuable capture in battle led to the southern part of the Peloponnese being surrendered to the Byzantines and thus, it became the heart of the Despotate of Morea. Born in fire and bloodshed, Morea's regiments of fine soldiers and cavalry know all too well that what they fight for is the livelihood of the despotate and potentially all that graciously Greek in this world."
 invitations_to_outside_settlers: "Friends of Morea, Welcome!"
 invitations_to_outside_settlers_desc: "The economy of Morea is nothing too great as the land has been used by countless generations of Greeks whilst also coming under the torment of foreign armies marching through. In order to help reinvigorate the communities who till the land, we should invite settlers to Morea and be much more open to who comes to and from our land. Encouraging upward population growth should help us rebound from the depths of economic uncertainty."
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall: "The Hexamilion Wall Emulated"
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall_desc: "The only land connection to the Peloponnese has historically been along the Isthmus of Corinth, with this passage way being guarded by the mighty Hexamilion Wall built between 408AD and 450AD, during the reign of Theodosius II. Morea must take the Hexamilion Wall as an example of what kind of fortifications it can and should build, ones that last a long time and that can be improved upon as time goes on whilst also being stationed at key strategic points so that our enemies will have the hardest time possible besieging them."
 battles_for_aegean_dominance: "Ruthless Naval Warfare"
 battles_for_aegean_dominance_desc: "Morea's navy has never been anything serious when compared to the naval forces of Venice, Naples, or any other serious Mediterannean power, but we still have had plenty of experience fighting hostile ships in small-scale battles in the Aegean Sea. We should be learning from these various naval skirmishes and trying to improve our sailors and ships as much as we can so that we can overcome any foreign threat out on the open water."
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea: "Influential Venetian Merchants"
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea_desc: "Merchants from Venice are common in the Aegean Sea; they have been for centuries and will most likely continue to spread their influence far and wide. Over where we are, Morea is perhaps the prime beneficiary of Venice's outward influence since Venetian merchants do good business with Morean traders instead of Muslim traders to the north and east. Through these Venetian merchants, we will learn to refine our own trade practices and become a Greek entrepot."
 communication_between_our_forts: "From Fortress to Fortress"
 communication_between_our_forts_desc: "The various fortifications throughout Morea are strong in their own right, but they lack proper communication between their various locations. Whether we build dirt or paved roads or try set up various stations to facilitate communication between them, Morea needs them to be able to relay messages across the land so that a more effective resistance to enemy forces may be coordinated. Even partisans from local towns can be called upon by this enhanced communication system should the times call for it."
 new_home_for_greek_power: "Haven for Greeks"
 new_home_for_greek_power_desc: "The Despotate of Morea is a dim beacon of hope for Greek people, but one that shines nonetheless. Byzantium once stood as the bastion of Greek culture and tradition, but perhaps it is time for that torch to be passed on to their children who are more capable of bearing the weight of such a legacy. Such a legacy will be guarded at all costs and the military of Morea is prepared to fight to the very last man should said legacy be threatened."

 the_constitution_of_padua_desc: "Starting the in early 1000s, political movements around Padua made it necessary that our city establish for itself a constitution and a proper administrative body for governance purposes. Though some like Venice and the Papal States do not care for our constitution, it is perhaps the foundational pillar by which we have held to for centuries now, and it is a pillar that we will continue to build off of well into the future."
 memories_of_the_league: "Lombard League Memories"
 memories_of_the_league_desc: "The days of the Lombard League are long gone seemingly, but its memories are very much still alive in Padua to this day. The intrusion of the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the refusal to fully submit by cities from Northern Italy continues to give Paduan people hope and morale whenever an invade comes through to besiege our settlements."
 learn_from_defeats_due_to_venice: "Defeated Before by Venice"
 learn_from_defeats_due_to_venice_desc: "Our defeats by the Republic of Venice have made things rather difficult in Padua, but things are not as hopeless as they might seem. Our administrative body has learned from the past and knows just how vital a strong standing military can be; encouraging the build up of land forces for the defense of Padua will henceforth be one of our highest priorities."
 build_up_the_university_of_padua: "The University of Padua"
 build_up_the_university_of_padua_desc: "Founded in 1222 by students and folks from Bologna, our noble university is filled with scholars of all fields of study. But is it enough for Padua? Is the university large enough to house intellectuals from even more fields of study as time goes on? The answer to that is, of course it isn't! Thus, we must be ready to build up the University of Padua with more facilities and areas of study so that we can continue to attract more righteous and forward-thinking scholars."
 insight_into_humanism: "Humanist Ideas Expanded Upon"
 insight_into_humanism_desc: "Many around us in the Italian Peninsula are concerned with theological insights, mercantile prospects, mercenary contracts, or artistic splendor. Padua, however, is concerned more with the notion of humanism combined with Christianity itself; we wish to have a population that is strongly civic minded and that can participate in civic processes that involve their land and matters that affect their own lives. Despite Padua being a small center for this new notion of humanism, we can ensure that it becomes a staple part of scholarly work in the future."

 the_council_and_credenza_of_padua_desc: "Beholden to the Paduan people and those inside our borders, the general council and the credenza (executive body) of Padua are what keep things in line for the most part. We must work to refine both administrative bodies over time with new legislation and reforms so that we can have more sharp-witted advisors and wholesome officials."
 the_upstart_city_once_again: "The Path to Paduan Prominence"
 the_upstart_city_once_again_desc: "It is not a particularly glorious or easy path, but the path to Paduan prominence is what we are destined to walk along. We must be ready for what hardships are to come, what corrupt deals we have to contend with, and what wars we will encounter along the way. Whatever comes at us though, we will remain stalwart and bear the brunt of the oncoming storm of hardships."

 blessed_by_saint_maurice_desc: "St. Maurice of the Theban Legion in the 3rd Century was a peculiar figure and one who, according to the tales we have been passed down, refused to harm fellow Christians despite the orders from his superiors. It is this stalwart attitude in the face of what we know is wrong that strengthens the faith of those in Coburg, and the martial tradition that St. Maurice inherited from his time in the Theban Legion can be somewhat emulated in Coburg's own soldiers. Fight for faith, and fight for Coburg!"
 develop_the_regality_of_coburg: "Royalty in the Land of Coburg"
 develop_the_regality_of_coburg_desc: "If we are to ever be with the highest echelons of royalty throughout Europe, Coburg must be fit to host some fine banquets and ceremonies. Doing this will of course require us to develop the land of Coburg properly and build up infrastructure to get proper building materials, hireable artisans, and competent engineers. Once we've done this, we will be well on our way to becoming a true royal state in Europe."
 the_reformation_in_coburg: "At the Edge of Turmoil"
 the_reformation_in_coburg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation reaches out to every corner of Europe, we of Coburg cannot help but feel its harsh effects on our population. Divided down to the familial level in many cases, the Protestant Reformation is for many nothing but a horrid showing of what religious divides can do to people. But, our administration is finding good lessons in the fires of religious violence as they are realizing just efficient a tolerant and integrated administration can be."
 disconnected_and_reconnected: "Shady Inheritances"
 disconnected_and_reconnected_desc: "As all of the Holy Roman Empire knows, inheritance can be a tricky subject and it can often lead to disconnected and strangely shaped territories. Coburg is no stranger to this and our royalty are keen on seeing that any split up pieces of Coburg are united into the central royal domain. Considering how inheritance laws can be manipulated too in places around us, connecting our various pieces together shouldn't be too hard."
 royalty_preserved_in_style: "Refined Aesthetic Taste"
 royalty_preserved_in_style_desc: "As Coburg grows and becomes stronger internally, the aesthetic taste of our people is becoming more refined as well. Reviving old styles and reinventing them with more modern construction techniques and modern materials will go a long way to helping us achieve the prestige and honor that we desire, and it will also help us obtain the influence we desire with other states around us."
 invest_in_long_term_structures: "Functional yet Prestigious Structures"
 invest_in_long_term_structures_desc: "And as we pursue our refined taste in artistic structures, we must not forget about the functionality in our many buildings. Whether they are simple houses and manors or places of creation like forges and foundries, these places can all benefit from Coburg's focus on aesthetics and methods of construction. As the years go by, we will see that our engineers and builders will be some of the best that Europe has to offer."

 the_highest_houses_of_the_land_desc: "Once we have achieved a sense of lasting internal peace, and once we have been able to satiate the desires of our nobility and common folk, Coburg will be fit for ascending to the highest parts of European diplomacy.

 burgundian_influences_in_hainaut_desc: "Philip the Good of Burgundy has done much to take over the lands in and around Hainaut, yet the influences he exerted over Hainautian land is something that was cause for political developments instead of just pure rebellion. The politically minded people of Hainaut saw the inept policies of the Burgundian monarchs not as a call for war at every given moment, but rather as a learning point that could later be implemented in a better form of government. Let us where these ideas are fully realized."
 calls_for_estates_general: "Call the Estates General"
 calls_for_estates_general_desc: "The policies of the Burgundian monarchs made many cities around Hainaut and also including Hainaut call for the Estates-General. This gathering of the three principle estates of the land (the clergy, nobility, and the Third Estate) is but one step toward improving upon the policies of governance that the Burgundians had put forth. Hainaut should and will improve upon the Estates-General over time and see to it that more people in the land get representation as time goes on."

 punching_above_our_weight_desc: "Much like the other cities of the Low Countries, Hainaut can and has punched above its weight in battles before. When contributing to the Burgundian cause in various conflicts to defending our own land when need be, we can be sure to always hold the line in battle to the very end. Any nation that is able to get our forces on their side will surely be thankful for our support."
 lessons_of_personal_unions: "Lessons of Personal Unions"
 lessons_of_personal_unions_desc: "Many in and around Hainaut know just how these lands came under the authority of Burgundy: through the notion of personal unions. What Hainaut and its highest officials have learned from this time of being under subjugation is that flexible diplomacy and a strong royal house is what keeps certain states independent, and if Hainaut can master having a solid diplomatic sector whilst maintaining its own royal dynasty, it will be able to keep its own power safe from competition."
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy: "Consolidation of the Economy"
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy_desc: "As our diplomacy develops upward, our city must also develop at the same time. Through trade is where we gain most of our profits and it is through attracting more and more merchants to come to our city that we will thrive in the future. Such is the fate of places like Holland and Brabant, such will be our fate too since taxes and military conquest are something we cannot always rely on."
 lack_of_expansion_chances: "Lack of Military Conquest"
 lack_of_expansion_chances_desc: "Where we lack in military capability for conquest we will make up for in developing the infrastructure of Hainaut. As we concentrate our efforts on improving our trade outlook, it would do us well to also work to improve our markets, our defensive structures, our manors and houses, and even our military camps. Developing internally is what will help Hainaut survive in the hostile climate that is European politics."

 focus_on_diplomatic_matters_desc: "If it wasn't for our time under the authority of Burgundy, where would Hainaut be? Just another province of the French? Or perhaps another prince in the Holy Roman Empire? Both are probable outcomes, but for now, Hainaut is looking upward with its diplomacy and its royalty. We work toward steadily improving the lives of our people; we work toward building stronger structures with firm functions; and most of all, we work toward making sure that we have strong allies through confident and prudent negotiations."

Though the Wettin Dynasty is relegated to the annals of history, we of Meissen in this current age benefit from the work they did to build up the lands of Meissen. Honoring them through public acknowledgements in ceremonies and building up from where they left off will ensure that we have a lasting legacy in the land."

 claims_from_saxony_desc: "Meissen is often seen as from a previous era when Stem Duchies were still a recent memory and East Francia was still something that people called upon for claims and such. Despite the amount of time that has passed though, Meissen can still press claims from long ago that it once had and see to it that claims from the Electorate of Saxony are partially enforced too (though the later is something that needs more work since we are not exactly the Electorate of Saxony)."

 old_influences_around_the_hre_desc: "Meissen was influential in these olden times as well, having connections in many places thanks to the prominence of the Wettin Dynasty. If we can rekindle these old relationships and take advantage of what ties we still have whilst also building up new ties to other dynasties, Meissen will be in a much stronger position diplomatically."

It isn't a simple cut-and-dry answer for many states and we of Meissen struggle wit the religious debate here and there, but we need to have an answer before religious conflict ruins us. Once our stance is firmly shaped, we can work toward uniting our own people around it."

 education_up_to_meissener_standards_desc: "Out of the fires of religious conflict and new ideas being spread around, Meissen is seeing a blooming interest in education and schooling. Building up not only universities, but libraries and small-scale schools could seriously help our people learn to read, write, and learn new subjects so that we can eventually have a more productive and lively society."
 the_question_of_porcelain: "Porcelain?"
 the_question_of_porcelain_desc: "Meissen's many connections in the Holy Roman Empire and its neighboring states has granted it access to a number of luxury goods from foreign places, but none of these foreign goods are quite as interesting to us porcelain. Coming from the lands to the far east and made with immense care and precision, these works of art are seen in the highest echelons of royalty all throughout Europe for good reason. Officials in Meissen insist that we work on improving our production methods so that we can produce this kind of luxury product here since it could seriously improve our economic prospects, and who are we to say no to something like this?"

 sponheim_and_andech_rivalries: "Sponheim and Andech Rivals"
 sponheim_and_andech_rivalries_desc: "Our founding was not without troubles as the Sponheim and Andech families sought to cripple the power of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. We did not back down when these families went against us since they threatened a bastion of God's grace on this very earth, no, instead we turned the tables on them and strived to make gains against them so as to secure our borders and our politics. These rivalries will forever be known in Aquileia's history and they will give us a strong position when taking to future rivals."
 alpine_border_of_aquileia: "The Alpine Passes"
 alpine_border_of_aquileia_desc: "The mountains to our capital's north are a hinderance to many who pass through them and controlling the select passes that allow passage during winter times can make Aquileia a valuable place. Not only this, but guarding these passes will give our miliitary more experience in harsh conditions. Training in winter weather and in defensive environments will serve to benefit Aquileia."
 lessons_from_natural_disasters: "Rebuilding from Disasters"
 lessons_from_natural_disasters_desc: "It was in the 1300s that Aquileia was at its lowest point to many. Ravaged by earthquakes and other mishaps, the capital city was nearly abandoned altogether because of these events. Thus, the capital of the Patriarchate moved to Cividale, then to Udine, and then finally to Friuli where a bustling and robust city began to grow. It is from this series of events in the 1300s that we must learn from so that in the future, when disasters fall upon our land, we can rebuild whatever cities are affected in a quicker and more efficient manner."
 the_rivalry_against_venice: "The Rival of the Republic"
 the_rivalry_against_venice_desc: "Undoubtedly the largest rival to Aquileia has been the Republic of Venice. Dominated by favorable politics and in comparison to us, Venice took advantage of our internal disunity and formally annexed the Patriarchate of Aquileia in 1433 and sought to secularize our land. Their effort has been met with resistance though, and now a resurgent Aquileia is at hand and ready to combat whatever Venice might throw at us."
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds: "Prevent Vassal Collapse"
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds_desc: "One factor that helped lead to Aquileia's collapse in the past was internal feuding between various subjects, all of which took a toll on the administration and military we had at the time. Working on a closer level with our subject states and integrating their administration into our own at various points will help keep these feuds to a minimum, and if we can prevent any feuds from happening in the future, we will have a supremely stable state."
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity: "Guided by God"
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity_desc: "Our state is guided by the principles of Christianity more so than others in the Italian Peninsula (save for the Papal States of course), yet we don't rely entirely on Christian doctrine for our politics and military. Despite this though, our people from all walks of life are devoted to the faith and are devoted to living it out in their day-to-day lives, or at least ot the best of their ability. Bishops, cardinals, deacons, and priests are welcome in Aquileia at all times, for this land has and will continue to be a land guided by God."
 ensure_the_parliament_stays: "Institutions for the People"
 ensure_the_parliament_stays_desc: "The parliament of Friuli was once a sort of makeshift government body in the Patriarchate of Aquileia in the 1200s, but by the end of the 1200s, it had become a strong institution in Aquileia that helped voice the interests of the people of Friuli and the military of the state. Meeting up to ten times a year and especially during important vacancies of the patriarchal office, we should continue to utilize this parliament system to help build trust in the government from the ground up."

 no_jews_allowed_desc: "Since the pogrom of 1349 where over 1000 Jews were publicly burned to death, we have been a city free from the menace of Jewish people! We have a strict enforcement of the laws in which Jews are forbidden to stay in the city past 10PM and a special tax must be paid for any horse that a Jew would ride in on. Some would say that we take unreasonable measures to ensure that we are free from the influences of Jews, but we do not care for these opinions; we only care for the religious integrity of our dear city!"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg: "Printing the Deeds of Strasbourg"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg_desc: "Printing materials is revolutionary for many people in and around Strasbourg since it can spread information at an unprecedented rate. Though we know this power will not always be used for good, we can at least embrace the fact that printing books and manuscripts in greater numbers will help educate the population we have whilst also providing commerce potential unlike anything we have had before."
 control_of_newspapers: "Control the Weekly Newspapers"
 control_of_newspapers_desc: "Because the printing press has become a more regular thing inside of Strasbourg, newspapers have become a regular sight all throughout the city itself. Done in weekly batches usually, they are the perfect vector in which foreign powers could try to undermine our authority within the city itself, which is why we must control the newspapers as much as possible. If we are able to maintain this control despite the changes in politics around us, we will be much more stable and prosperous."
 humanist_thinking_for_christians: "Humanist Thoughts, for Christians"
 humanist_thinking_for_christians_desc: "The burst of new and innovative thoughts coming from the late 1400s and early 1500s means that Strasbourg is becoming a place where theologians and philosophers alike come to debate and expand their ideas. Though we may have severe disdain for heathens in our land, those proposing perhaps heretical ideas are more tolerable to us."
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg: "Educate those of Strasbourg"
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation burns European cities to the core with religious strife, we of Strasbourg are doing our best to maintain a semblance of balance between Catholics and non-Catholics. If we can build a university space where these differing Christian minds can reasonably talk out their differences and sort through different doctrines in peace, we will benefit both from the peace maintained through the university space and also from the new ideas that stem from what these theologians and philosophers come up with."
 french_intrigues_in_our_land: "French Intrigue"
 french_intrigues_in_our_land_desc: "Whilst we do benefit from protections inside the Holy Roman Empire, we cannot underestimate the lengths to which the French will go to secure the lands that straddle the border of both France and the Holy Roman Empire. Strasbourg is just one of those cities and we need to ensure that our defensive measures are some of the best around if we are to halt any French advance through our land."
 independent_high_fashion: "Strasbourg High Fashion"
 independent_high_fashion_desc: "And yet, being on the border between these two gigantic powers of Europe means that we have developed a unique sense of high culture and fashion within the highest ranks of our nobility. Strasbourg may be famous for a myriad of other things, but one more thing we can add to that list is the fact that no other noble family will look quite as nice and unique as the noble families from Strasbourg."

 invasions_from_all_sides: "The Invasions of Malta"
 invasions_from_all_sides_desc: "Malta's geography both in-person and on a political map means that it is important to a variety of powers that border the Mediterranean Sea. Our gracious island has thus witnessed plenty of invasions from all directions over the centuries, and with each invasion came with it new people and new experiences that helped build up the culture of Malta. But, as we build up a firm state for ourselves, we will need to make sure these invasions of our island come to a halt via our navy and what coastal defenses we have."
 maltas_universita: "The Universita"
 maltas_universita_desc: "For quite some time, the usual body of governance on Malta has been the 'universita'. It is not as all-encompassing as a monarchy, but it serves the people of Malta well enough because of how things are geographically and politically. It would do us well if we kept the univerista and refined it over time."
 the_midst_of_the_sea: "In the Midst of the Sea"
 the_midst_of_the_sea_desc: "Malta is a threat to some small states in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is the grim reality that other states are much more of a threat to Malta itself. Being where we are in this grand sea, we will need to build more docks and shipyards to uphold a strong navy that can defend Malta whilst also promoting its trade interests in the nearby island of Sicily and the trade hub that is Tunis."
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids: "Learn from Hostile Raids"
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids_desc: "The raids from North Africa are not unknown to Maltese people, but infact they are some of the harshest measures against Malta that is just shy of declaring a formal war against us. Decades of these raids against us has given us knowledge on how to combat these raiding vessels out at sea whilst also training sailors and admirals in Malta for upcoming naval campaigns."
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory: "Remember the War of the Sicilian Vespers"
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory_desc: "Though Malta played a minor role in it, the War of Sicilian Vespers in the late 1200s made quite an impact on Maltese history. Though those circumstances that led to the war will never happen again, we can at least work to provoke similar incidents in places near Malta so that we can get involved and possibly enforce some of our 'ancestral' claims."
 defensive_dedication: "Righteous Defense"
 defensive_dedication_desc: "Despite what foreign states would have in store for us, Malta has managed to remain a bastion of freedom for itself. Iberian influences, Italian interests, and even North African incursions have not stopped us from building up our islands to where we are now, and what has helped us most in this independent time period (besides our navy) has been our stalwart fortifications. Compounding upon existing defenses and fortifying our islands even more is of the utmost importance to Maltese people as defense is the way by which we survive."
 language_distinct_from_others: "The Maltese Language"
 language_distinct_from_others_desc: "Unique to other languages near us due to its influences from Arabic and other sources other than Latin, the Maltese language is part of what makes us a true sight to behold. We can call ourselves Christian or Muslim at various points, but what we can't call ourselves is Italian, Iberian, or Arabian; we are Maltese, a true pearl in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea."
 CRT_ideas: "Cretan Ideas"

 CRT_ideas_bonus: "Cretan Ambition"
 kingdom_of_candia: "'Kingdom of Candia'"
 kingdom_of_candia_desc: "Under the rule of the Venetians, our land was known as the 'Kingdom of Candia' and was a staging ground for projecting Venetian influence outward toward the Aegean Sea. Though those days of Venetian dominance are gone, we still remember how strong of a naval presence they had around our island through both their fleets for combat and their fleets for trade. Crete should thoroughly aspire to be like Venice in this sense so that it too can project its naval presence outward."
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus: "The Revolt of St. Titus and More"
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus_desc: "The Venetian authority over Crete was not concrete and uniform in the past; Cretan people have had a long history of revolting against Venetian authority to assert the autonomy of Crete as a whole. Perhaps the largest revolt of these was the Revoly of St. Titus that happened from 1363 to 1368. Though the efforts of the rebels were not realized as Venice regained control eventually, they strived to create the 'Republic of Saint Titus' for all of Crete, an idea which has lasted to this very day. In memory and in the honor of those fellow Cretans that have fallen in battle to sustain Cretan autonomy, we carry forth in our righteous journey."
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations: "Exposed to Foreign Ideas"
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations_desc: "Venice was not completely bad in what it did for Crete and its people, we must admit that. In their time ruling over us, they exposed the Cretan people to a number of innovations and ideas that had their start in the various cities of the Italian Peninsula. This spreading of ideas and technologies must be cultivated if Crete is to proceed on as true state of its own, for learning about what others have come up with and integrating it into Crete itself is vital for staying afloat on the political scene."
 natural_defenses_of_crete: "Even the Hills have Weapons?!"
 natural_defenses_of_crete_desc: "Our island is not the most welcoming place for invaders to land on, no? Hills and rugged terrain all across the island make invading our homeland something of a Herculean task since not only do we have the terrain to back us up, we also have partisans from all across Crete ready to do battle with enemy invaders. The defensive nature of Crete will make invaders say to themselves, 'Even the hills have weapons?!' and we will laugh as we beat them back again and again."
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy: "Refine the Cretan Navy"
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy_desc: "Genoa and Venice fought for quite a long time for influence on Crete in the past, and even though Venice won out in the end, we still have a distinct maritime legacy in us that stems from both. In order for Crete to hold its own in wars across the Mediterranean Sea, it needs to have a stronger navy with more sailors at the ready; building docks and shipyards across Crete's coastline is the first step in this process."
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders: "Defensive Expertise of Cretans"
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders_desc: "Cretans are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to devising a defensive strategy; even our peasants know how to defend their local areas with anything from crossbows and swords to outdated gunpowder weapons. Not only this, but working in tandem with the rugged terrain makes it so that fortificatiokns built from stone are less needed. Cretan fortifications though, are some of the best ones across Europe and this is largely due in part to partisans being able to supply and assist the garrisoned defenders."
 trade_viability_empowered: "The New Trade Hub"
 trade_viability_empowered_desc:  "As Crete prospers, so does trade across the Aegean Sea and in nearby trade nodes. We cannot say exactly how profitable things will become in the future, but we can see to a fair degree that Crete itself will become a strong hub for merchants in the future. Perhaps in time, we can succeed where Venice left off in terms of trade dominance."

 saint_liborius_desc: "Long ago, the patron saint of our city walked the earth around us. Saint Liborius, the second bishop of Le Mans, is revered by those of Paderborn for his patronage against certain ailments of the human body. Let his blessing shine down upon the ones who lead Paderborn, and the ones who serve the Prince-Bishopric from the ground up."
 the_river_pader: "The River Pader"
 the_river_pader_desc: "Though perhaps not a great river like the Rhine River, the river Pader is where we call home and it helps give us a slight bit of range with regards to our actions alongside productive potential within our farms and estates. Paderborn may not be the strongest state in terms of food production or trade income, but having a slight focus on these sectors through our home river can help things out."
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities: "Two Realms of Authority"
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities_desc: "The one who leads Paderborn is entrusted not only with religious authority, but also with secular authority. It is a daunting task for many since it requires an intelligent and careful mind that is also oriented toward heaven above, but Paderborn rulers have shown that they are capable of taming both realms of authority within Paderborn itself."
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii: "Lessons from Dietrich III"
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii_desc: "Dietrich III of Moers was a costly figure within Paderborn as he led wars against a variety of other small states that included Soest and its bishop. His wars put Paderborn into a great amount of debt, necessitating financial restructuring and a shift in how economics played out in Paderborn itself. It is from his costly mistakes that we will learn from so that we are not lured into ruinous wars that devastate our economy."
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left: "Religious Reformers of Paderborn"
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left_desc: "With the Protestant Reformation in full swing all across Europe, Paderborn has had its own share of reformers wanting to change the very nature of Paderborn's administration. We are hesitant to just let these reformers do as they please, but we cannot deny that some suggestions they bring forth are valid ways of improving Paderborn as a whole. Perhaps we can work with them and tolerate these heretics for the greater good?"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful: "Uphold Religious Toleration"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful_desc: "Be they Protestant, Calvinist, Baptist, Lutheran, or even Jesuit in religious conviction, Paderborn has come to welcome them all over time thanks to the fact that we have had strong influences from both religious sides. Enforcing a more tolerant view on religion throughout Paderborn is what will ultimately lead to it being a successful religious state in these troubling times."
 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers: "To Empower Paderborn"
 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers_desc: "We have shown time and time again how pious we are and how strong our policies are toward empowering all those of various Christian denominations inside Paderborn, yet still other bishoprics and princes around Paderborn seek to dethrone us from our rightful position of ecclesiastic authority. We must not stand by as these challenges to our authority are levied from year to year and decade to decade, no, we must fight to the bitter end and uphold the authority that Paderborn has."

 lippe_feuds: "The Age of Feuds"
 lippe_feuds_desc: "Are we blessed by these feuds, or cursed by them? There are people who argue for both sides, but the leaders of Lippe hold firm to the latter due to the fact that capitalizing on these feuds and winning them could lead to serious territorial expansion alongside increased influence. This is a long way off though, and for now we must be content with working the fields of battle with our soldiers to enforce the claims of Lippe."
 raise_the_status_of_lippe: "Rising Higher and Higher"
 raise_the_status_of_lippe_desc: "Lippe is not just a singular town as some outsiders might think, but rather it is a collection of towns that form a state that is greater than the normal sum of its parts. Further developing these towns upward through promoting infrastructure like roads, libraries, and markets will help bolster Lippe's economic status greatly."
 what_belongs_to_lippe: "What Belongs to Lippe"
 what_belongs_to_lippe_desc: "The feuds of the past ensure that Lippe will have no shortage of expansion paths; our dynastic claims alongside the various diplomatic webs we are in help make this a reality. Thus, when we annex new territory through war, others around us will know that we are justified in our actions and those of Vienna, Prague, Munich, and other prominent places will have nothing to fear from our expansion."
 fortify_lippe_towns: "Protect our Belongings"
 fortify_lippe_towns_desc: "As we build upward and expand outward, Lippe is going to need stronger garrisons is it not? Strengthening the defensive structures we have and building more castles belonging to our royal dynasty is exactly what will help hold our realm together, especially if armies from Bohemia, Austria, or some other place come marching through to curb our momentum."
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy: "Shifts in the Shadows"
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy_desc: "It is partially thanks to our deals and practices with regards to diplomacy that Lippe is as influential as it is. The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly. To help with this, formalizing our diplomacy with a secure office of sorts in the administration will do just the job."
 adopting_church_ordinance: "The Church Ordinance of Lippe"
 adopting_church_ordinance_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has given birth to a number of issues in Lippe that we otherwise would not have had, yet still we find that we can grow from the fires of this religious fracturing of the Catholic faith. Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."
 relations_with_surrounding_powers: "Tinder for the Fires"
 relations_with_surrounding_powers_desc: "We have been a subject to other states and independent at other times, meaning our connections go far throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Whilst we sustain ourselves on diplomacy and keen administrative practices, we must always be aware of the fact that we have mercenary contracts open to us in the way that others do not. Feuds and shady connections have their advantages, if you can survive to see the end of the former and utilize the latter."

 waning_power_of_the_bishops_desc: "Despite Osnabruck's past, the power of the the bishops has been waning over the course of the 1300s and 1400s. Though the cathedral chapter may have its power on the rise, more secular authorities are seeing to it that the politics and regular administrative matters of Osnabruck are handled by competent folks of educated backgrounds. Perhaps it was the clergy that was holding us back this entire time? We may find out in the future."
 rely_upon_military_servants: "The Coming of Military Governance"
 rely_upon_military_servants_desc: "The knights of old are becoming a relic of the past, but still Osnabruck has a great amount of influence from prominent military leaders and officials since they carry out the defense and offense of our land. Whilst we should not try to unduly cut these officials from power, we should be wary of what influence they have in our government even if they provide inherent benefits to us during times of war."
 war_profits_in_osnabruck: "Profits lead to Influence"
 war_profits_in_osnabruck_desc: "Osnabruck's various fueds across state lines are taxing upon the local populace, but for merchants seeking new chances at making a profit, they're actually rather intriguing opportunities. Mercenary contracts offered to us are often helped out by the fact that our merchant class is willing to take these daring attempts at making a profit during times of war, so why shouldn't we use these contracts?"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck: "A Religious Mess"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck_desc: "With the rise of Protestanism and its various offshoots, Osnabruck is a mess with religious communities striving to have ultimate influence over the land. These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to have a solid solution with favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by the administration of Osnabruck."
 religious_orders_called_in: "Call Upon Holy Orders"
 religious_orders_called_in_desc: "From the Jesuits to the Augustinians, Osnabruck has been the place where a variety of these holy orders come to settle down in so that they can cultivate their influence and add to their ranks. Whilst we will refuse their influence in our daily politics, we can at least work with them on recruiting new missionaries that serve both these holy orders and Osnabruck itself."
 theological_insights: "University of Osnabruck"
 theological_insights_desc: "Though the fires of religious reformation have blazed across Osnabruck, one good thing that has risen from the ashes has been the University of Osnabruck. It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work. Cultivating the university to be where new ideas spread around Osnabruck will be what helps our state stay in the realm of innovativness whilst also staying true to our faith."
 peaceable_governance: "Locked Down"
 peaceable_governance_desc: "Through just governance and having strong religious convictions, we of Osnabruck have come to secure ourselves a stable state. Turmoil of the past be damned, we have not fallen just yet to foreign annexation and we will strive to be as independent as we possibly can. With this in mind, we will govern as we always have strived to: Justly, honorably, and righteously."

Despite this value being seen by multiple people groups across the islands, the rivers prove to be tough to control for any one set of people including our own. No matter the cost though, we will put our troops to use and learn to overcome what defenses our enemies have put in place by these rivers; they will not hold back our state from prospering."
 mutual_defensive_alliances_in_sulawesi: "Bugi Pacts and Alliances"
 mutual_defensive_alliances_in_sulawesi_desc: "The Bugi people make up a great portion of our core population, but they are not so loyal to the state as one might want. Instead they have a fair deal of autonomy and often make pacts with each other or fight over pieces of land within our own borders. The threat from the outside is becoming more and more obvious to the Bugi people inside Bone though, and we are making progress to ensure that the pacts made between our own Bugi people are kept for generations to come."
 changes_due_to_islams_presence: "Deals with Islam"
 changes_due_to_islams_presence_desc: "Islamic merchants and preachers have been spotted coming in and out of our waters, and some of them are even setting up shop on our coasts to do trade. While we welcome some of these practices and trade goods they bring with them, their beliefs and practices do clash somewhat with our own traditions. Perhaps we can learn to remedy the two with time?"
 prepare_bugi_communities_for_trade: "New Ships on the Horizon"
 prepare_bugi_communities_for_trade_desc: "And as our ships continue to patrol the waters of Sulawesi and nearby islands, we are continually getting word of new ships sailing into and out of these waters. They are far different from Muslim merchant ships, but just who could they be? Whoever they are, we will stretch out a hand and welcome these people into the ports of Bone, so long as they seek to engage in good commerce."

 the_great_many_people_of_south_borneo_desc: "Though the Dayak people in general the most numerous when it comes to the core region of Sambas, there are several other people groups that make up our state as a whole. Some Malay people are here, folks from Java have settled in places, and there are even some small communities of Bugi and Batak people spread throughout. If we are to see a successful Sambas in the future, we must pull these groups together into a cohesive melding of workers in one area, administrators in another area, but perhaps most importantly, fighters for all of our land."
 fear_through_headhunting: "Headhunting!"
 fear_through_headhunting_desc: "It is a tradition as old as the Dayak people themselves: Headhunting! A gruesome and barbaric practice by some foreigners, yet it is something that instills fear in the hearts and minds of our enemies. Let those who stand against our administration know well that should they raise a sword or musket against us, they will find themselves victims of our hunters in the aftermath."
 ferocity_even_on_water: "Ferocious Sailors of Borneo"
 ferocity_even_on_water_desc: "What our headhunting does for our reputation is bring a ferocious note to it, and when our sailors go forth to do battle with foreign ships, this reputation is raised up even higher thanks to just how ruthless we are on the high seas. Headhunting is not limited to just land battles, no, our fighters will do it throughout naval battles and their aftermath, meaning they are more than ready to get in close to other vessels out at sea."
 remedy_the_sea_and_land_dayaks: "Dayaks of Different Places"
 remedy_the_sea_and_land_dayaks_desc: "There are two somewhat clear distinctions of Dayak people in Sambas: 'Iban', meaning 'sea', and 'Bidayuh', meaning 'land'. Iban Dayaks live closest to the coasts, as one might expect, whilst the Bidayuh Dayaks live in the dense tropics of our mainland. The former take care of fishing, the latter take care of farming, yet both seem to have consistent feuds that make Sambas a rather volatile state at times. If we can work to connect the sea and land Dayaks closer together both culturally and economically, governing them will be easier for all of Sambas."
 primogeniture_within_the_monarchy: "Seeing how Sambas Develops"
 primogeniture_within_the_monarchy_desc: "Sambas is developing at a nice pace with communities seeing the rise of structures like tax offices, workshops, and small centers of learning. This development is helped by the fact that our administration and royal family are keen on keeping the traditional Dayak form of hierarchy in play with males taking priority over females for succession purposes. But, women are not cut out of every facet of power; Dayaks and throughout the rest of Sambas, both men and women can obtain property ownership and jostle for communal influence in that way."
 spreading_of_malay_influences: "Malay Influences in Sambas"
 spreading_of_malay_influences_desc: "We are no stranger to Malay people from the west, but it is only recently that they have begun to set up more extensive trading communities along our coastline. In doing this, they are bringing with them their religion and their traditions which are tough to handle on their own, but what we really benefit from is the expansion in trade value for Sambas. The more we trade with the Malay people it seems, the more we profit in the form of money and capable sailors."
 kaharingan_influences_upon_sambas: "Regular Islamic Contacts"
 kaharingan_influences_upon_sambas_desc: "Islamic influence in Sambas is not new by any means, but the meeting of Islam and the native religious traditions of the Dayak people (called 'Kaharingan') has been rather interesting to say the least. Though Kaharingan is seen as a form of Hinduism by outsiders, to us it is a very core part of the people of Sambas as a whole; Islam's influence across those who follow Kaharingan is noticeable in that it is melding with these traditions in a variety of ways. If we can stoke this intermingling of ideas instead of potential religious conflict, Sambas might be able to have Islam and Kaharingan live side-by-side in peace."

 borjigin_descendants: "Borjigin Descendants"
 borjigin_descendants_desc: "Stemming from Qasar, brother of Ghenghis Khan himself, we Khorchin Mongols are viewed with a great deal more legitimacy than other petty leaders around the steppe. It is not enough that we might simply use our lineage to get by and preserve what land we currently have, no, we must make ourselves known and push back the tides of factionalism and civil unrest! We must make way for the return of proper Borjigin power and authority!"
 one_of_the_three_ming_guards: "Sole Surviving Guard"
 one_of_the_three_ming_guards_desc: "Originally, in 1389, there were a series of 'guards' established by the Ming Dynasty in order to ensure northern defenses, but these guard groups were on the forefront of a volatile region full of conflict. Two of the guards have fallen already, yet the Fuyu Guard (led by descendants of Qasar) barely escaped and made a path eastward. Where they settled is where we find our capital today, and it is from here that we will set up a base of power to retake what belongs to us."
 stretch_from_gansu_onwards: "Reach for Gansu and Beyond"
 stretch_from_gansu_onwards_desc: "Several decades have passed since our time in the Gansu area. No longer are the memories of the Fuyu Guard around in those communities, but we Khorchin Mongols still very much remember our time over there. As we bide our time and search for more chances to expand our power, we will reach back for Gansu and reclaim it for ourselves, reminding those whom we conquer just who they should be swearing fealty to: the Borjigin line of descedants."
 ming_influences_on_politics: "Ming Influences on Khorchin"
 ming_influences_on_politics_desc: "Our time as subjects of the Ming Dynasty has not always been prosperous, but it has been formative and life-changing in more ways than one. Whilst we still hold on to our traditions dearly, we cannot deny that taking up some administrative practices from the Ming Dynasty has continued to assist in our every day governing of the land we hold."
 reputation_for_loyalty: "Adept Subjects"
 reputation_for_loyalty_desc: "Seeing both times as being independent and not, Khorchin Mongols are keenly aware of what they must do to stay alive and well. Defeats may incur subjugation upon us, but that does not mean we are completely gone; instead we should be looking to new routes of expansion in terms of foreign diplomacy whilst we serve under a different lord."
 wars_for_unity_in_northern_yuan_ashes: "Through Ashes and Blood!"
 wars_for_unity_in_northern_yuan_ashes_desc: "The Northern Yuan state is simply not what it used to be. The rise of the Four Oirats and the various struggles with the Ming Dynasty to our south has led to the entire region being up for grabs by various khans of all stripes. Let us waste no time as this battle royale continues to play out, we must set off pull down the walls of our enemies before they can do the same to us!"
 simple_khans_no_more: "An Evolving Khanate"
 simple_khans_no_more_desc: "And as we ride off into the vast steppe of our homeland, blood dripping off of us and sweat coming down our forehead, we look to the lands of our ancestors. They seem almost unchanging, no? But that is simply not the whole story, not anymore at least. The land is beginning to change just as we Khorchin Mongols are changing with time. The land is slowly being developed more and more in key places, just like how our administration is evolving more and more to meet the needs of its own people."
 SRM_ideas: "Sirmur Ideas"

 SRM_ideas_bonus: "Sirmur Ambition"
 compete_around_nahan: "Nahan Competition"
 compete_around_nahan_desc: "The beginning of Sirmur's history is a bit murky to say the least, but oral tradition tells us of the tumultuous history Nahan had as the predecessor state to Sirmur. Despite what it struggled with, Nahan flourished over time and imparted onto us a legacy of local conquest in these mountains and highlands around us. These harsh lands are ruthless in terms of political movements as it is, so we would be wise to keep in mind the warlike mentality of our ancestors."
 to_learn_when_we_aid_others: "We Send Aid and Observers"
 to_learn_when_we_aid_others_desc: "Though we have not been able to exert our power outward like other states in the south have, we have been able to send aid and observers outside of Sirmur to help in foreign conflicts. Sometimes Sirmur even sees subjugation by others, but we must not see this subjugation as a pure loss in competence for us. It is rather an opportunity for Sirmur to grow even more, just in a different direction! Sending aid to an overlord and observers to learn how they conquer, move in battle, and conduct administrative practices is exactly what Sirmur should be doing."
 how_to_farm_in_the_mountains: "Sprouting from just a Rock"
 how_to_farm_in_the_mountains_desc: "Many in the south think that places like Sirmur are just rocky wastelands with very little in the way of agricultural potential, but these shallow people are deluded in their thinking. Sirmur has plenty of farming potential, we just need the funding and the tools to get the ground ready and the people settled in place. Now that Sirmur is getting on its feet in both previously mentioned aspects, we can start to focus on the agricultural sector and improve our overall grain stores."
 what_the_sikhs_teach_us: "Sikh Influences in Sirmur"
 what_the_sikhs_teach_us_desc: "Sikhism is something that is relatively new in terms of religious movements, but it is not without its followers that are becoming somewhat influential in Sirmur. Our proximity to the homeland of the Punjabi people and the epicenter of the Sikh faith means that sometimes we do get refugees of Sikh affiliation, meaning we need to contend with some serious religious differences in our own land. Sirmur is by no means in a state ready to stoke religious tensions, so we will be striving for mutual understanding with the Sikh people in our own land."
 chains_of_sirmur_command: "Chains to the Administration"
 chains_of_sirmur_command_desc: "Sirmur has traditionally been a somewhat decentralized state due to the mountains we find our heart of power inside of, but developments over the past few generations has led to our power increasing, our revenue growing, and our knowledge of administrative practices increasing. It is with all of these factors combined that we will enforce the chains of command more than ever, extracting our dues fairly and justly from our subjects as the months go by."
 transition_the_fiefs_of_sirmur: "Higher Level Practices in Sirmur"
 transition_the_fiefs_of_sirmur_desc: "For far too long Sirmur has relied on people of royal blood that may or may not be loyal to the administration. Whether it is a raja, maharaja, emir, or sultan at the head of the Sirmur state, the loyalty to them must be ensured so that defenses are not compromised and the state itself is growing instead of shrinking. Slowly replacing these noble fiefs with people more loyal to the administration (such as members of the royal family) will be the next step to improving our state as a whole."
 the_usage_of_the_kukri: "The Kukri!"
 the_usage_of_the_kukri_desc: "Used for centuries in our home region of Nepal and outside of it, the kukri is a deceptively simple weapon that is more commonly thought of as a farming tool. And yet, it is this weapon that our military use regularly for hand-to-hand combat (alongside any martial arts that are known to them) with devastating success. Especially in the tight mountain passes where armies may encounter each other more suddenly, the kukri has become a tool that both experienced and new soldiers trust to get them through close quarters combat. Going forth, having it be a standard training weapon will serve to instill a great degree of strength in our soldiers."
 KMN_ideas: "Kumaon Ideas"
 KMN_ideas_start: "Kumaon Traditions"
 KMN_ideas_bonus: "Kumaon Ambition"
 kurma_second_avatar_of_vishnu: "Second Avatar of Vishnu"
 kurma_second_avatar_of_vishnu_desc: "Our name stems from the Sanskrit word 'Kurma' meaning 'Tortoise' or 'Turtle, and it is also synonomous with the second avatar of Vishnu. Though Kumaon has had a long history full of highs and lows, remembering the foundation of it all through the very name of the state itself should give us proper direction. Let us harden our defenses, pick the best points for defending our land, and ensure that any invader that dares intrude on Kumaon soil regrets every step they take!"
 shifting_capital_cities_around: "From Place to Place"
 shifting_capital_cities_around_desc: "In our own history, the capital has shifted within the general vicinity we would normally call 'Kumaon'. From being at first in Bajinath to then going to Champawat later on, the transitions have been gradual but significant enough for our people to remember them to this very day because moving such supplies and resources to a new location is pivotal. If we can channel this will again in the future for new building projects and when we need to perhaps relocate some signficant structures, we will be able to take serious advantage of the terrain inside our borders."
 dedication_through_bagnath_temple: "Temples Galore in Kumaon"
 dedication_through_bagnath_temple_desc: "Throughout the generations, devotion to the deities has been central to Kumaon and the people that have lived and died inside its borders. The temples we house from our ancestors and the temples we construct today are all to the glory of the deities above and serve as open displays of our own piety no matter what happens to the administration or the royal family. Bagnath Temple, Baleshwar Temple, Nagnath Temple, all of them and the ones we build up in the future will be marvels to any outsider that steps foot into our land."
 repeated_himalayan_wars: "Fighting in Thin Air"
 repeated_himalayan_wars_desc: "Piety does not beget peace, however, and it is in times of war that Kumaon must show it has the will and the power to survive. Luckily we have plenty of experience fighting in these higher reaches so we are much more versed in how to get through stone fortifications whilst keeping our own regiments supplied with resources."
 highlanders_versus_lowlanders: "Fighting in the Heat"
 highlanders_versus_lowlanders_desc: "We must tend to our tactics and strategies when dealing with fighting at lower altitudes though since the politics to our south are anything but stable. Whether it is the Delhi Sultanate, militant Rohillas, or some other group invading and conquering territories, Kumaon fighters need to be able to put up a strong defense and offense when push comes to shove against us."
 reconcile_on_religious_grounds: "Seeing Eye to Eye"
 reconcile_on_religious_grounds_desc: "At the end of it all, we still refrain from justifying our conflicts through theology of any kind. Some zealous people of Kumaon detest this but we see no reason to engage in this religious warfare that others around us think is righteous. Instead we would rather reconcile on religious grounds so as to have fewer issues when it comes to governance and unrest."
 DTI_ideas: "Doti Ideas"
 DTI_ideas_start: "Doti Traditions"
 DTI_ideas_bonus: "Doti Ambition"
 linked_to_kuamon: "Linked to Kumaon"
 linked_to_kuamon_desc: "After the Katyuri Dynasty of ages past fell, Kumaon rose up in prominence and has held sway around this area for many generations. Though their power is waning somewhat, we cannot deny our links both culturally and politically to Kumaon; embracing this link to them could perhaps grant us an easier time taking what land they of Kumaon have claims to."
 seven_children_of_the_katyuri_kingdom: "Eight Princely States Remained"
 seven_children_of_the_katyuri_kingdom_desc: "Once the old Katyuri Dynasty fell from grace, there were eight princely states that were left in the ashes: Kumaon, Doti, Baijnath-Katuri, Dwarahat, Baramandal, Askot, Sira, Sora, and Kali Kumaon. As things progressed, Doti and Kumaon remained as the only two serious forces that could live up to the legacy of the past and it is this claim to the old throne of the Katyuri Dynasty that we are known for. There is respect to be had for living within the bounds of this legacy, that much is certain."
 surpass_kuamon_in_importance: "Rivalry with Kumaon"
 surpass_kuamon_in_importance_desc: "Whilst we respect Kumaon to a degree in regards to politics and diplomacy, we cannot stand by and let them continue to usurp the power that rightfully belongs to Doti instead. The rulers of Kumaon have proven time and again that they cannot handle the chains of power effectively and that their subjects run wild without proper orders. Soon enough we will have our chance at showing Kumaon and others just how much we can live up the legacy of the Katyuri Dynasty, we just have to bide our time."
 usage_of_the_kali_and_karnali_rivers: "Kali and Karnali River Usage"
 usage_of_the_kali_and_karnali_rivers_desc: "The name 'Doti' stems from the older term 'doab' which generally means the land between two rivers. As geography would have it, the Kali and Karnali Rivers are just such two rivers that feed the heart of our state and its capital, meaning that if we are focused enough, we can certainly make these mountains and highlands bloom with crops and productivity."
 rise_of_the_dotiyali_and_kumauni_languages: "Dotiyali and Kumauni Languages"
 rise_of_the_dotiyali_and_kumauni_languages_desc: "The languages of these lands, Dotiyali and Kumauni, are not as prominent as other languages like Sanskrit or Persian, but our common people speak both Dotiyali and Kumauni more so than they do other foreign languages. Promoting our own languages through the writing of manuscripts and books whilst also using it for regular court functions will allow us to become a much more distinct polity in the region, one that refuses to be taken over by foreign influence."
 hindu_festivals_within_doti: "Embrace the Festivals"
 hindu_festivals_within_doti_desc: "And as we continue to grow and blossom through the ages with mountains around us and innovations streaming in, our people dance and sing in the great many festivals held every year around Doti. They have their own distinct flavor thanks to being conducted in the mountains for so long, but they are still festivals that solidify our foundation amongst the people. No royal is too good to go to a Holi festival, and no worker is too unworthy to attend Harela!"

 remember_the_khasa_kingdom: "Memories of the Khasa Kingdom"
 remember_the_khasa_kingdom_desc: "Prior to Jumla being an independent entity, the Khasa Kingdom reigned in its place and stretched over a considerable distance in the hills and highlands. When it collapsed, Jumla was left to fight amongst the other polities for dominance in the land, yet the legacy left by the Khasa Kingdom still shines brightly to this day. Let us embody that legacy going forward and continue to proclaim ourselves as its successor as we triumph into the future."
 skirmishes_in_the_mountains_of_nepal: "Skirmishes by the Roof of the world"
 skirmishes_in_the_mountains_of_nepal_desc: "Our soldiers fight rough battles that are shallow in numbers compared to the battles in the south near the Ganges River, but near the roof of the world, there isn't much room to throw tens of thousands of soldiers into the fray. That is why we (and many others) have learned to skirmish with smaller numbers of troops so that there is less of a concern about supply routes and armies being too big to coordinate effectively."
 emulate_our_rajput_relatives: "Emulation of the Rajputs"
 emulate_our_rajput_relatives_desc: "Some find it as a tenuous connection, but part of our original royal family is somewhat connected to the Rajput clans in the south near Chittor and Mewar. Whilst we of Jumla are far from being true Rajput warriors and nobles, we can emulate some of their martial prowess by emphasizing stricter training methods and a more well educated set of commanders. We won't be using cavalry like they do for obvious reasons but we can most certainly put our focus on the standing soldiers of Jumla."
 never_forget_the_baise_rajya_era: "Lessons of the Baise Rajya"
 never_forget_the_baise_rajya_era_desc: "What came directly after the collapse of the Khasa Kingdom is known as 'Baise Rajya' or, individual polities that were sovereign in their own right for a short time and ruled by Khas. There are still some around to this day, Jumla being one of them, but that collapse into decentralized unrest and disorder instilled harsh lessons into the ruling family of Jumla. Lessons on keeping the peace, maintaining authority, and sustaining a proper military for the state are all included so as to keep the entirety of the state itself stable."
 in_fighting_we_lead_from_the_front: "Lead from the Front!"
 in_fighting_we_lead_from_the_front_desc: "There are some that think the ruler of Jumla should stay back in the capital when conflict breaks out so as to not risk getting captured or hurt, but what good is the ruler going to do the soldiers if they are in the capital and delegating all authority to military officials? Jumla needs the ruler to be ready and able to lead from the front with the men of the army! It is dangerous, true, but it is also inspiring to see that the one who rules Jumla is ready and willing to suffer the ravages of battle alongside a mere recruit or officer."
 learning_flexibility_in_combat: "Teaching in Defeat and Victory"
 learning_flexibility_in_combat_desc: "In Jumla's experience, fighting in the high elevations of our home has been harrowing and rough over the generations, but it has taught each generation many things that may or may not carry over to the next generation. Now that writing and printing are becoming more of a realiy all around us, it is time that we make those teachings from past generations put into solid manuscripts and tomes ready for future generations to learn from and critique. The more we can master fighting in these perilous conditions, the better off we will be when we must face the strong states in the south."

 tharu_people_heartland: "Heartland of the Tharu People"
 tharu_people_heartland_desc: "We, the Tharu people, have been in this region for countless generations, cultivating the land and taking care of ourselves as politics around us shifted and swayed. Despite whatever happens on the outside, we have retained much of our traditions from previous generations unlike other people groups around us; we have not given up what our ancestors cultivated and we are not about to let outsiders breach and break down what magnificent customs we have built up so far."
 reistance_to_malaria: "Resistant to Malaria"
 reistance_to_malaria_desc: "Disease is a constant threat to any community of any size. Whether it is the Black Death or consumption or even malaria, any and all disease can spell disaster for a community if it spreads enough and instills panic and chaos. Yet the Tharu people have been seemingly gifted with an inherent gift: resistance to malaria! It is not in every single Tharu person, yes, but many people of Tharu descent are noticeably resistant to this terrible disease that plagues our region and nearby ones. It is through this resistance that we can better cultivate a stronger state for the Tharu people."
 tharu_people_are_of_the_forest: "We of the Forest"
 tharu_people_are_of_the_forest_desc: "We are not mountainous people to the same degree as nearby people groups in our region are; the Himalayas are vast in how many people they contain, but the Tharu people straddle that edge between the mountains and the lower regions. Thus, we are and have been seen as people of the forest for a great many generations now, practicing farming, hunting, and gathering to a much greater degree than our mountainous cousins. Being of the forest will help garner us easier methods of production of resources for all sorts of means like warfare and trade."
 reaching_the_other_tharu_languages: "Tharu Languages, United"
 reaching_the_other_tharu_languages_desc: "Our language is quite distinct from others, yes, but it isn't a unified language either. There are several 'versions' of the Tharu language spread throughout yet they are all somewhat intelligible to each other. If we can unite these various Tharu groups into our own state and sort out the differences, we will be able to handle politics from the top down to a much greater degree."
 promote_the_badghar_system_locally: "The Badghar System"
 promote_the_badghar_system_locally_desc: "The 'Badghar System' is a system of local governance used by the Tharu people where a a group of villages elect a single badghar as chief for a year; the election takes place usually in January or February after the Maghi Festival. This elected governance at the local level helps keep the balance of power in check and would greatly help us in extending our reach to more local communities where we need to collect taxes and recruits from, so why not try to implement across our nation?"
 retain_our_own_traits: "The Tharu People Remember"
 retain_our_own_traits_desc: "The Tharu people are perhaps one of the few groups of people least influenced by Hinduism as a whole, but we cannot deny that over time Hindu traditions have played some role in shaping Tharu society and culture. Still, our people remember and perform the religious and cultural practices that are distinctly not Hindu in origin, meaning that we are quite proud of our independent cultural past. As we go forth, we will continue to keep these customs with despite what outside influence we come across."

 eight_rivers_in_kathmandu: "Eight Rivers for Kathmandu"
 eight_rivers_in_kathmandu_desc: "Our capital city is filled with rivers, eight of them to be exact, all of which originate in the high mountains nearby. They provide ready amounts of water for irrigation and our citizens so that they may grow despite the rough political conditions around them. We are not blessed with a great amount of land to use like those of Delhi or Dhaka get, but we can certainly make use with what we have available."
 rife_with_growth: "Rapid Growth to be Tamed"
 rife_with_growth_desc: "Our ambitious growth in population size and infrastructure has led to a number of ideas and innovations spreading through Kathmandu, but these growths must be tamed and regulated so as to not cause friction between the common folk and the administration of Kathmandu. Compromises will be made, agreements will be signed, and Kathmandu will see the steady rise in power it has always been destined for despite the troubles of the past."
 designed_to_be_like_chandrahrasa: "Designed like the Chandrahas"
 designed_to_be_like_chandrahrasa_desc: "Within the Hindu epic 'Ramayana', the indestructible sword given by Lord Shiva to Ravana is called 'Chandrahas'. It is this very sword that the founders of our city based its shape on centuries ago, and even though its growth has been somewhat hard to maintain throughout the centuries, we have come very far in cultivating the city of 'Chandrahas'. The city and its people will strive to emulate the powerful indestructible sword of the Ramayana epic both in their day to day lives and when defending the very land they stand on from invaders."
 revive_the_eight_barracks_of_kathmandu: "The Eight Barracks of Kathmandu"
 revive_the_eight_barracks_of_kathmandu_desc: "In the times of the old Licchavis, Kathmandu was surrounded by eight barracks protected by 'Ajimas', goddesses from our pantheon of deities exclusive to Kathmandu and nearby areas. Though much has changed since the time of the Licchavis (such as their architecture being destroyed by earthquakes), we find ourselves still in need of these barracks at the edge of our city to provide us with a sense of security and militancy. Rebuilding them for our people and for our own protection will undoubtedly help spur more people to join up into the ranks of Kathmandu's military."
 contacts_with_tibetan_buddhism: "Converse with Tibetans Again"
 contacts_with_tibetan_buddhism_desc: "In the past, Kathmandu was a major trade hub and transit site between the Indian subcontinent and Tibet as a whole, so much so that Bhrikuti (from our region) married the Tibetan monarch named Songtsan Gampo. This marriage from back then helped bring Tibetan Buddhism into our region of the Himalayas, promoting religious dialogue and the diffusion of cultural and religious traditions throughout all regions nearby Kathmandu. Perhaps it is time we reach out to the Tibetan people? Perhaps it is time that Kathmandu becomes another trade hub and center of diffusion of cultural ideas."
 ready_to_rebuild_kathmandu_again: "You'll Never Keep Me Down!"
 ready_to_rebuild_kathmandu_again_desc: "Kathmandu has seen destruction in previous eras thanks to nature itself, not just by the hands of devious enemies. Earthquakes are known to cause great destruction across our region and Kathmandu has felt the wrath of them in full, especially when a large earthquake destroyed much of the architecture from the Licchavi era, thus forcing the people to rebuild in the midst of terrible hardship. These experiences have hardened those Kathmandu and made its inhabitants ready for whatever nature may through at it; you can knock its people down to the ground, but you will never keep them down."

 malla_inheritance: "An Inheritance for Generations"
 malla_inheritance_desc: "Prior to Makwanpur becoming what it is now, the Khasa Kingdom reigned supreme in the region between Tibet and the Indian subcontinent. Though it prospered for some time, it eventually collapsed in on itself and left a variety of claimants struggling to reclaim that lost glory. Makwanpur is one such claimant and one that has proven itself worthy enough to stand the test of time so far. It is our duty going forth to enforce our inherited claims across the region through diplomatic efforts or military conquest."
 compete_against_gorkha: "Backs Against the Wall"
 compete_against_gorkha_desc: "Gorkha as well as other small polities around us put pressure on the political scene in the region, do they not? All of us moving back and forth, struggling to gain an edge over each other in the face of neighboring states that could seek to conquer us from the south or north; truly it is a daunting task to be where Makwanpur is. It is this precarious position, though, that allows us to train our regiments in a more skilled fashion since we can test out what works and what does not work against our neighbors. We just need to be careful we don't make one too many mistakes..."
 buddhist_tidings_across_makwanpur: "Buddhism's Impact in Makwanpur"
 buddhist_tidings_across_makwanpur_desc: "Though we are mostly Hindu in our alignment, there are some Muslims and Buddhists scattered throughout Makwanpur. The legacy of the latter is even larger in Makwanpur than in other states, interestingly enough, as one of the Khasa rulers left an in scription on the Ashoka pillar with a six-syllable mantra: 'Om mani padme hum (May Prince Ripu Malla be long victorious)'. This connection to Buddhism, albeit not the strongest one there could be, should be revived and looked into throughout Makwanpur, for the theological and philosophical dialogue that could be had would certainly give innovative life to our land."
 clouded_history_of_the_region: "Shrouded in Countless Claims"
 clouded_history_of_the_region_desc: "Makwanpur as well as the other petty states of the region are left in a sea of various claims around the region. Some say they deserve this land or that land, others try to buy the lands they want if they have enough money; some of Makwanpur's own rulers have tried both and there is no shame in that. All of this is part of the 'sorting process' our region must go through in order to see which state is capable of rising to the challenge. We are here to ensure that the one that can do as such is Makwanpur."
 chaubisi_and_baise_rajya: "Chaubisi and Baise Rajya"
 chaubisi_and_baise_rajya_desc: "After the Khasa Kingdom collapsed, what it left behind were known as 'Chaubisi Rajya' and 'Baise Rajya', numerous petty states that have since fought for dominance of the region with little success over the generations. Makwanpur is of course among these petty states but we have been keen on learning how to integrate others into our state as we go on; sometimes we just need to be more forceful with our diplomacy since not all in the region are ready to recognize the prominence of Makwanpur."
 hardened_through_the_generations: "The Hardened of Makwanpur"
 hardened_through_the_generations_desc: "The road to get where we are has not been easy at any level. Citizens endured harsh times, the military fought to their dying breath at various points, religious adherents suffered greatly in certain conflicts, and our administration has been strained under the pressures of internal and external forces. Yet all of this has brought more and more life into Makwanpur as we can and have been learning how to deal with these issues as they wash over our state. Makwanpur is never one to be stagnant, not when the regions around us are so volatile and when our own home area is besieged by internal conflicts and external influences."

 strategic_dzongs_of_bhutan_desc: "Dzongs are a sort of monastery-fortress hybrid and they are prominent throughout Bhutan as a form of defense, a place where a governor of sorts can stay, and where people can come to worship in peace most of the time. As Bhutan continues to grow and develop, dzongs will be crucial in maintaining order and faith throughout the land."
 land_of_the_drukpa_subsect: "Land of the Drukpa Kagyu"
 land_of_the_drukpa_subsect_desc: "Buddhism within Tibet has had an interesting history to say the least, and Bhutan is part of that history too as a land on the edge of Tibetan religious politics. The growing tensions with rival schools in Tibetan lands has led to a plethora of so-called Red Hat Sect members (otherwise known as followers of the Kagyu School) fleeing to Bhutan, meaning our religious politics are being colored greatly by the Kagyu School itself. Most important among these that our people and administration have embraced over the generations is the 'Drukpa Kagyu' subsect, and it is a subsect that can truly embody Bhutan as a whole."
 becoming_the_zhabdrung_of_bhutan: "The Zhabdrung of Bhutan Lives!"
 becoming_the_zhabdrung_of_bhutan_desc: "What we need going forward for all of Bhutan to stay unified under is, well, a leader of course. For far too long we have been struggling to maintain political cohesion due to Tibetan influences spilling over into our lands, but we must take a stand! We must turn back these influences at once! Bhutan needs not the guidance from an authority in Lhasa or in the Kham region, no, Bhutan will be led by a true Zhabdrung ('At Whose Feet One Submits')! Through their spiritual and political authority we will have peace and the people of Bhutan will follow them instead of some far off figure."
 resisting_tibetan_invasions: "Refuse Outside Authority"
 resisting_tibetan_invasions_desc: "And yet, even as we proclaim ourselves a Zhabdrung and reform our own administration over time, various states surrounding Bhutan seek to influence its politics and its people, thinking that such a small slice of land cannot really be a threat to them. These notions are far from correct and we will show them just how wrong they are when they come to strike us down; Bhutan will fight to the bitter end!"
 ordered_theocratic_matters: "Unhindered Theocratic Matters"
 ordered_theocratic_matters_desc: "In continuing our development, the theocratic nature of our administration does not mean the Zhabdrung has sole authority over anything and everything. There is a Druk Desi (regent) elected on a three-year term, a state council that includes regional rulers from various dzongs, and even a Je Khenp (lord abbot) that is elected from a state monastic body. In laying this all out for the future and strengthening these positions of government so they do not fall out of relevance or to political intrigue, Bhutan can maintain its own integrity despite however outside politics shift around."
 by_tsa_yig_do_we_operate: "Tsa Yig at our Foundation"
 by_tsa_yig_do_we_operate_desc: "Tsa Yig is really any monastic constitution/code that is codified based on Tibetan Buddhist precepts. Whilst usually every monastery has its own variation of Tsa Yig found within, Bhutan itself should be governed by it as well to keep in line with how our administration functions. In doing so, we should also be ready to adjust certain parts of the code as Bhutan comes across various new ideas and innovations, meaning that the code is not something that is rigid for all Zhabdrungs of Bhutan."

 exclaves_or_just_friends_of_bhutan_desc: "When the several members of the Kagyu School fled Tibetan lands to find homes in other places, Bhutan was one of them and it is here that they found a great deal of influence. But it is not only in Bhutan that Kagyu members spread their teachings and influence, for in fact other places surrounding the Tibetan region have small yet prominent communities of Tibetan Buddhists that follow some form of the old Kagyu School. Reaching out to them and improving relations with them will earn us a great deal of respect in the future."

 heed_the_words_of_guru_rinpoche: "Guru Rinponche, Patron of Sikkim"
 heed_the_words_of_guru_rinpoche_desc: "Long ago, Guru Rinponche (also known as Padnasambhava) came to the land of Sikkim and blessed it in its entirety whilst also telling of Sikkim's future. This future monarchy of Sikkim coupled with the introduction of Buddhism to the land has shaped Sikkim in what it is today, and though we still struggle with how our administration functions from time to time, we are fulfilling the future predicted by the glorious guru himself."
 strong_ties_to_tibet_still: "Strong Ties to Tibet"
 strong_ties_to_tibet_still_desc: "Written records of what happened in Sikkim's past are scarce to say the least, and the records we have about the early times around when Guru Tashi came down from Kham to settle in Sikkim are vague as well. What we know for certian, however, is that Sikkim has always and continues to have strong ties to Tibet as a whole, whether it be on religious, diplomatic, or even economic grounds. Utilizing these ties to better support our capital and its royal court will undoubtedly bolster Sikkim's prominence."
 refugees_from_tibet_welcomed: "Spilling of People from Tibet"
 refugees_from_tibet_welcomed_desc: "Religious issues in the central region of Tibet itself are concerning to say the least, but Sikkim has not been able to be involved in most of it. Mostly we sit on the side, waiting to hear and see what news comes through regarding the changes in regards to religious schools and their political influence. Often times after we get this news, we recieve an influx of religious refugees and it is through them that we are learning to be much more cooperative and understanding of our fellow religious traditions."
 nepali_but_tibetan_too: "Caught in the Middle!"
 nepali_but_tibetan_too_desc: "Sikkim, much like the other small states around it, is a state that is caught in between regions: the Indian subcontinent to the south and Tibet to the north. It is hard to carve out a living in these highlands and mountainous areas, but Sikkim and many others are doing so day by day. As we do so, we are providing paths to and from the previously mentioned regions, which means we are slowly becoming a center of trade and commerce in not just resources, but also in the exchange of ideas."
 tibetan_style_administration: "Govern like a Tibetan"
 tibetan_style_administration_desc: "The strong influences from Tibet has meant that our government structure is very much in the style of traditionally Tibetan states. Dzongs are a regular feature in Sikkim and they serve as administrative centers and great defensive measures against any and all that try to invade Sikkim. Continuing down this path of Tibetan governance should only serve to cement our footprint within the region, culminating in a wondrous and safe Sikkim state."
 sikkim_tribes_to_become_integrated: "Recognition of Sikkim's Tribes"
 sikkim_tribes_to_become_integrated_desc: "There are a great variety of tribes scattered throughout Sikkim and they cannot all be put under lock-and-key because of, well, the natural terrain and environment of Sikkim. Instead of trying to routinely enforce strict laws on them through our dzongs, we should come to understandings with the tribes and give them some degree of autonomy so that they can work the land as they have for centuries. If we can cooperate with the tribes and integrate them properly, we will certainly have a fresh pool of loyal people ready to defend Sikkim no matter what happens."

 won_by_the_strength_of_the_bow_and_arrow_desc: "Our name was decided long ago during the era of Ten Limbu Kings, and it means roughly, 'acquired by the bow': Li = Bow; ambu = acquire. Despite all that has happened since this era of divded states within Limbuwan, our people still hold the distinction in the name up high, for it is by the bow and arrow that we will triumph and prosper. Even when new weapons come to the doorstep of Limbuwan, the bow and arrow will remain a timeless weapon for our men to train and hunt with."
 festival_toward_yuma_sammang: "Yuma Sammang of Limbuwan"
 festival_toward_yuma_sammang_desc: "Goddess of our people for countless generations now, Yuma Sammang, is worshipped in almost all of Limbuwan's heartland despite Hindu traditions becoming more and more prominent. The fesitval in her honor that is held every three years still draws in many people from across our territory and it helps cultivate a strong sense of community and identity for us in these changing times."
 keep_morang_in_check: "Keep Morang in Check"
 keep_morang_in_check_desc: "The Kingdom of Morang has been a thorn in the side of Limbuwan for decades now, but it has also been integral to the prosperity of Limbuwan as a whole. The upstart rulers from there have tried to promote their own autonomy and alliances with outsiders which undermines our own power in the capital! This cannot be allowed to continue if we are to become a cohesive state that can protect itself from outsiders, no, we must curtail Morang's growing power and centralize power in the capital as time goes on. If we have to ensure that some Morang rulers have 'accidents' that cause an untimely demise, then we will absolutely do so."
 political_exiles_cannot_hide: "Retribution Against Political Exiles"
 political_exiles_cannot_hide_desc: "And when we try to cut through the political intrigue that Morang and others heap upon Limbuwan, some think that they can escape into foreign lands of nearby states, sometimes even our rivals! The audacity of these enemies of Limbuwan is undeniable, and what is also undeniable is our resolve to seek out these political enemies and exiles no matter the cost. If it means a rival state must suffer in our conquests, then so be it! Limbuwan will not tolerate these underhanded measures by its own people!"
 cut_down_the_traitors_of_limbuwan: "Traitors in Limbuwan!"
 cut_down_the_traitors_of_limbuwan_desc: "Not even the various villages of Limbuwan are completely within our own sphere of absolute authority, for the era of Ten Limbu Kings gave each part of Limbuwan a great degree of autonomy and self-governance. Though we try to gently rein in the autonomy of these individual kingdoms in our land, some still seek to ally our rivals in the east and west, meaning that they are nothing more than traitors to Limbuwan as a whole! Exposing these heinous alliances against Limbuwan from within and cutting down the key perpetrators inside each village and town will help to show where the true authority of Limbuwan lies."
 rally_to_the_rising_cause_of_limbuwan: "Rally the People"
 rally_to_the_rising_cause_of_limbuwan_desc: "At the end of the day, when all is said and done in Limbuwan, we simply strive for peace and prosperity inside our own borders. That dream is a nice one to have but one that is often times too far to reach in its entirety, meaning that we must do what we can with what we have to keep our own land and people safe. Our struggles through thick and thin has cultivated a strong sense of unity in the core areas of Limbuwan, and it is amongst these Limbu people that we will draw our power from in the future."

 by_the_lunar_dynasty_of_gorkha_desc: "Though they may not be the leading influence in Gorkha, the Lunar Dynasty has had a great deal of influence on Gorkha's history so far. The fact that they are of the Kshatriya varna (warrior ruling caste) has also helped instill a sense of militancy within Gorkha's population, but it only added on top of the already militant nature we already possess due to the collapse of the Khasa Kingdom and the subsequent feuding states that rose up from the ashes."
 from_gorakhnath_onward: "Self-Discipline of Gorakhnath"
 from_gorakhnath_onward_desc: "Our name, Gorkha, stems from the legendary Hindu yogi saint Gorakhanth. Being one of the two notable disciples of Matsyendranath, he emphasized the search for truth in one's own life and yoga itself as a spiritual discipline that can inform a person on how to live an ethical life of self-determination. His teachings still ring clear to many in Gorkha to this day and especially those within our military as they need perhaps the most spiritual (and physical) discipline for the road ahead."
 a_domestic_market_empowered: "Look Inward for Wealth"
 a_domestic_market_empowered_desc: "Being that we are between two 'giants' that sometimes unify and crumble into pieces, Gorkha should be looking for chances to build up its own internal structure and prosperity so that it can survive independently from any power in the north or south. An internal market that can take care of itself and that can maintain some degree of structure should trading partners in either direction falter would make Gorkha far more versatile later on. Perhaps we could even start to entice foreign merchants and states to become reliant on Gorkha should things go according to plan."
 construct_economic_crises_for_neighbors: "Economic Crises are Opportunities!"
 construct_economic_crises_for_neighbors_desc: "All too often we see the fallout of economic crises in surrounding lands as well as our own, but there are somehow still winners and losers in these times of terrible sickness and starvation. As Gorkha grows internally and externally, it might be to our advantage to institute and stoke the flames of an economic crises in nearby regions so that the people from top to bottom start becoming weaker to the point where they are easier to conquer. This strategy won't make us many allies, but it will make conquests far easier since the local people are less able to resist."
 prepared_for_reprisal_attacks: "Firm Walls; Astute Defenders"
 prepared_for_reprisal_attacks_desc: "Gorkha has enemies and friends in many foreign places, but we can't rely on our allies shouldering the brunt of wars in the future; we will surely be taking invasions of our own land and we must prepare for them. Luckily our home region is mountainous, full of building materials, and full of choke points that we can utilize to halt incoming invaders before they can reach the heart of Gorkha itself. The task at hand remains though: refine our fortifications and build more of them!"
 undermining_influences_in_gorkha: "Refuse Foreign Entries"
 undermining_influences_in_gorkha_desc: "We of Gorkha are never to sure of the intentions of foreign visitors and migrants. Sure most of them seem to mean well on the surface, but religious folk and crafty merchants have done their fair share of scheming and plotting so that they may take advantage of certain aspects of the Gorkha state in one way or another. We must take measures to expel these foreign elements in Gorkha before they get out of hand and before they begin to turn out own people against us."

 founded_on_a_defensive_pretext_desc: "When our island was being invaded to the north in the late 1300s, Minister Alakesvara of the Kingdom of Gampola founded a fortress in the south to serve as a base of power and defense. As Gampola faded into history though, the fortress became a serious broker of power and influence in the region, giving rise to what we today know as Kotte. In this defensive environment that we were founded in, we must always be ready for when northern incursions start again and try to strike southward; we must give them no quarter and resist at all times!"
 enemies_of_jaffna: "Refuse the Jaffna Advance"
 enemies_of_jaffna_desc: "The Jaffna Kingdom in the north has held land on the island for too long, but they are far harder to root out than one might imagine. Ties to the Vijayanagara Empire have meant that Jaffna can grow mostly unhindered, but that isn't the case forever. We of Kotte will soon take the fight to them and after that, reverse the incursions from the north and instead return the favor!"
 notable_monks_of_kotte: "The Monks of Kotte"
 notable_monks_of_kotte_desc: "Through Kotte living out its normal life and continuing to hold out against Jaffna and its allies, the various Buddhist monks of our land have continued to make magnificent works of art and literature. We cannot stand by and just let the work be done without recognition; we instead should be upholding their work and encouraging more to be done! The traditions of our land should be relished and indulged in by all throughout, no matter how far away from the capital they are."
 arab_and_european_style_firearms: "Arab and European Trade Benefits"
 arab_and_european_style_firearms_desc: "Kotte has seen trade deals from places such as Sumatra, East Africa, and even Arabia, but this should not be a shock to anyone. Even firearms from Arab traders have made their way to the lands of Kotte in small numbers, and with European traders arriving slowly for trade deals in the region, they too bring their firearms to Kotte for trade deals. Utilizing these wonderful gifts from afar will certainly help Kotte safeguard Kotte's place in the region despite how few of them continue to work in these humid conditions."
 striking_foreign_deals_at_large: "Without Interruption to Foreign Trade"
 striking_foreign_deals_at_large_desc: "Despite whatever happens inland on our island or to the north, we strive ultimately to maintain the course of our trade deals with merchants from afar. They provide wealth and influence that we would never have by just living off domestic production, meaning that keeping the good favor of mercantile folks is what we will continue to do as far as Kotte lives as an independent state."
 ensure_the_royal_family: "Trouble with Royalty"
 ensure_the_royal_family_desc: "If there is one thing about the royal family in Kotte, it is that it is susceptible to hostile intrigue and unfit heirs. In order to rectify this so that Kotte can have a stronger authority over the land as a whole without worry, there should be a system of checks on what the heir should know by certain ages, which means they will be needing an actual education within Kotte. Not only this though, but regularly keeping an eye out for disloyalty in the family itself will help keep it safe since any disloyal members can and will be disowned, denounced, and if possible, tried for their crimes."
 advantage_in_tropical_marsh: "A Tropical Nightmare"
 advantage_in_tropical_marsh_desc: "Kotte's best ally in conflicts, especially when invasions are imminent, is the terrain of the island as a whole. It is a tropical mess if one does not know the lay of the land, and on top of the tropical environment there are plenty of marshes across the entire island including near our capital fortress, meaning that should any invader attempt to subjugate Kotte through brute force, they will be met with an uphill battle unlike anything they have ever faced."

 a_weak_kotte_is_a_strong_kandy_desc: "Kotte is but a mere shell of its former self, and with Kotte's (coming) decline, Kandy can assert itself as a true power across the island! But it won't end there, there are still many claimants around and there is always the threat from across the water as Hindu commanders and ministers would love to see this island become their own. Kandy needs to be ready for any political shift that arises beyond its borders, for these shifts can easily be turned into opportunities."
 the_enemy_of_kandys_enemy_is_who: "The Enemy of my Enemy..."
 the_enemy_of_kandys_enemy_is_who_desc: "The island is rife with various factions and families that want dominance of one community or piece of land and this is true not just toward the coast, but even within Kandy itself. What we need to realize is that the enemies of Kandy's enemies can become Kandy's friends! At least for a short time so as to get us through the specific period we need them. Some might call our diplomatic tactics shady and unreliable, but we see it as what we need to do in order to survive as a cohesive state."
 even_when_defeated_we_can_strike_back: "Defeat is not Death!"
 even_when_defeated_we_can_strike_back_desc: "This land is a land of victory and defeats; the island has seen many great individuals rise and fall and that will continue far into the future. We of Kandy realize the extended version of this in that, defeat for us on the field of battle or in a major war is not the equivalent of death. We can and will strike back for our heartland no matter who holds it as our connections throughout the entire island are far more numerous than anyone can imagine. Age-old ties will be called upon; bonds extended by eras in the past will become fruitful once more."
 to_hold_sole_religious_dominance_here: "There Shall be only One!"
 to_hold_sole_religious_dominance_here_desc: "The island is dominated by our age-old traditions of Theravada Buddhism, yet to be recognized as the dominant state both politically and religiously are needed ultimately. To do as such, Kandy is going to need to extend its power across the entirety of the island eventually and encompass the all holy sites and holy relics found within. We are already partly there as we speak, the rest of the journey is yet to be walked."
 careful_and_calculated_deals: "Deals for Kandy's Survival"
 careful_and_calculated_deals_desc: "Kandy gets several deals and offers from outside states, but we have been too careless in the past with regards to what we sign off on since foreigners have been able to take advantage of Kandy's natural resources and good will. In the future we will need to scrutinize the very contracts we might sign and consolidate with our wider court at large on more matters since diplomacy is at the heart of Kandy's continued survival. One wrong deal and all of Kandy could fall through the floor and into the dungeons of a foreign power."
 just_how_do_we_consolidate_kandy: "Bringing Kandy Together"
 just_how_do_we_consolidate_kandy_desc: "Historically this land has been a nightmare to administrate as the tropical nature of things has made roads very hard to build and towns very slow to grow. Despite these struggles of the past, however, new innovations and new ideas are giving Kandy the tools to better consolidate the administration in general. Enforcing laws is becoming steadily easier and communicating with towns far from the capital is becoming less and less stressful."
 never_let_them_reach_the_heart: "Deny them Sweet Kandy"
 never_let_them_reach_the_heart_desc: "The sweet dream of holding all of Kandy under lock-and-key is in the minds of many on the outside, but we will be working at every point to make sure things stay as they are, a dream for them. Defending the heart of Kandy (that is the inner most parts of the island) through the usage of natural defenses, partisan attacks, and even set traps will help deter any and all invaders from coming to our land. Firearms won't matter much when the weapons are dripping wet and when the wheels for cannons are stuck in the marshes."

 the_impact_of_kutai: "Kutai's Impact"
 the_impact_of_kutai_desc: "Kutai has had a deep and lasting impact on Berau as a whole as indeed it is perhaps the oldest independent polity in the region that we know of. Generations of politics, religious shifts, and diplomatic moves has left Kutai and its nearby lands (like Berau) in a state of flux, but it is through this state of flux that we learn the most, incorporating the best practices from Kutai into our own and attempting to discard what practices do not work on a practical level."
 influences_from_sulu: "Sulu's Influence"
 influences_from_sulu_desc: "A much more recent state of Islamic adherence and indigenous culture, Sulu's influence over these lands that Berau calls home are notable in more ways than one. The masterful sailors and the simplistic yet verstile boats they use are perfect for trade and warfare alike, which is why they have become much more common around our own waters. Berau taking up these practices with regards to shipbuilding and sailing is only natural as looking out to the seas and controlling them through a large, skilled fleet is exactly what we need if we are to survive and thrive."
 blending_muslim_and_hindu_people: "Several Different Religious Communities"
 blending_muslim_and_hindu_people_desc: "Hindu traditions intertwined with indigenous belief systems were the majority in our lands for a long period of time, yet we have increasing numbers of Muslims entering our land to settle down and do business. Whilst we would rather not stoke the fires of religious tension throughout Berau, we cannot deny that these Muslim communities and merchants offer a great deal of insight into how we can manage religious differences across Berau. Whether it is through syncretism, pragmatism, or through extensive religious dialogue, we are beginning to understand just how these different religious communities can co-exist with each other."
 learning_about_how_to_govern_the_tropics: "How to Govern: Tropical Edition"
 learning_about_how_to_govern_the_tropics_desc: "It is no secret that maintaining a strong government in Berau's heartland is very hard as traversing the dense jungle and steep hills is hard enough, but adding humidity and rain on top of it makes things nearly impossible at times; thus, communication between villages and towns that are further inland can become impossible at times. Learning how to manage a somewhat more decentalized system of governance whilst we slowly make progress toward cultivating the land in a way that allows clear paths and eventually sturdy roads is going to be necessary if Berau is to survive."
 from_the_majapahit_empires_influence: "Majapahit's Old Lessons"
 from_the_majapahit_empires_influence_desc: "The time of the Majapahit Empire brought many islands and communities interesting innovations and customs, but the collapse of the empire left several places wondering how they should proceed and implement the power and lessons left unto them. Berau is one of those places left behind and we are only now able to put those old lessons to use via extending our range of trade links and through mastering our own trade routes. The Majapahit Empire opened up a great deal of trade routes near and far from Berau, and now it is time that we take our cut of each one."
 balancing_the_island_powers: "The Balancing Act of Berau"
 balancing_the_island_powers_desc: "The various influential groups across Berau's heartland are tough to balance as it is, yet there are other people groups across different parts of Berau that require our attention as well. Learning to satisfy the desires of each one at least on a basic level can give Berau a great deal of credence in communities on the fringe of the entire state itself as many groups that we must learn to satiate have complex connections to said fringe groups."
 plunder_and_piracy_around_us: "Measure Up to Dishonest Measures"
 plunder_and_piracy_around_us_desc: "The fact that ports across the region and nearby regions are so valuable and open to trade means that those who do not care for regulation and honest trading have a plethora of targets to pick from. Berau can easily become one of those targets, can it not? Our ports are growing and the people of our land are thriving, ensuring that attention is drawn to our land over time, but we must also be prepared to defend these incoming riches from pirates and privateers alike. Defensive fortifications, more discplined naval patrols, friendlier foreign relations, whatever it takes to become a safer haven for traders!"

 wanted_from_all_sides_desc: "We are at the confluence of several states and people groups, all of which want our land because it is valuable in more ways than one. Trying to cultivate a prosperous existence in this tension-filled region is hard enough as it is, but it comes with one advantage at least: we can make great use of our diplomatic channels in various neighboring states. If Basra must survive via diplomacy, then it will do just that!"
 the_capable_port_on_the_gulf: "Rival even to Bandar Abbas"
 the_capable_port_on_the_gulf_desc: "There are other ports and harbors around Basra that provide places for traders to dock at so that they can do business, yet few can see any that are better than Basra, Bandar Abbas, and the island of Hormuz. So crucial are these places that prosperity in this general region might never have come about if these places were not around, which is exactly why we must continue to build up Basra well into the future. It's docks and infrastructure are vital to sustaining a suitable rivalry with the other trade ports and drawing in key traders from afar."
 call_upon_tribal_loyalties: "Loyalty in the Marshes"
 call_upon_tribal_loyalties_desc: "Discontent in the marshes of our land is nothing new as this region near the end of the Tigris and Euphrates River is crossed by Bedouins, Iranians, Kurdish people, and so many others. Some settle down and propagate their teachings, others stop by and do business whilst still leaving an impact on the region, yet all of them usually stoke the flames of unrest in one way or another. As the tension builds, we will harken back to our base of power, the tribes of Basra and its surrounding areas, for capable fighters that know exactly how to defend the land by which they call their own."
 vehement_shiite_and_sunni_sects: "The Heat of Religious Friction"
 vehement_shiite_and_sunni_sects_desc: "Part of the issue Basra faces is the contention between various Islamic sects and schools of thought. They clash in violent skirmishes so as to settle not only who is right in the religious sense, but also who is right in the political sense because Basra is such a valuable piece of land in the region. Whichever we side with in the end, we can be sure that we will have no issues finding religious fervor and zealous preachers amongst the faithful."
 capitalize_on_basras_significance: "Look Upward to Basra"
 capitalize_on_basras_significance_desc: "Despite the hardships we have faced from both external and internal forces, Basra grows ever more through infrastructure development and diplomatic expansions. The road ahead is not going to be easy due to Basra still contending with tribes across the land and foreign states staking claims across our territory, but we are seeing more money line our pockets and a stronger sense of trade power in the markets Basra has some influence in. It is a slow growth rate, but one that can certainly be maintained."
 buffer_zone_on_to_greater_heights: "To Win the Loyalty of Basra"
 buffer_zone_on_to_greater_heights_desc: "With our developments in and around Basra, we are not just building up our own market and administration, but we are also building up a base of loyalty in our own population. Yes tribal feuds and cultural clashes often occur because of our geographic position, but we would be wrong to say that we are not cultivating some sort of success within our own people. Despite what foreign powers would say about Basra's internal situation, we know that there is a growing sense of fealty thanks to our governance."
 to_manage_diseases: "The Final Hurdle"
 to_manage_diseases_desc: "The hardest natural part of Basra that we must strive to overcome is that of rampant disease and famine. When push comes to shove in wars and Basra cannot get imports, famines and plagues spread across the main city and surrounding areas to the point that internal unrest rises dramatically. If we can set up a series of grain reserves, put efforts into making sick camps and soup kitchens, and possibly even build up a suitable navy so that Basra does not have to fear blockades, then maybe we can overcome this final natural hurdle."

 united_somali_communites: "United Somali Communities"
 united_somali_communites_desc: "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."
 dominant_merchant_fleets: "Fleets of Somalia"
 dominant_merchant_fleets_desc: "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."
 hegemony_over_ports: "Harbors of Somali Strength"
 hegemony_over_ports_desc: "Improving and building up our habors and docks is a natural part of promoting trade growth. From setting up new docking areas to building new structures for merchants to do business in, each one of our coastal cities and harbors is key in attracting merchants from everywhere we can think of."
 formal_clan_duties: "Formal Clan Duties"
 formal_clan_duties_desc: "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."
 somali_honor_guards: "Somali Honor Guards"
 somali_honor_guards_desc: "We have been the victims of our own ambition, in a sense. We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."
 command_east_africa: "Command of East Africa"
 command_east_africa_desc: "Our ambitions in East Africa are known all across our administration and as we continue to project our power over the great cities of wealth that line the coast of East Africa, we will only see our revenue rise higher and higher. Few can contest the amount of wealth made in cities such as Zanzibar and Mombasa as it is, now imagine how much more wealth they would bring in if we controlled them."
 somali_ocean: "The Somali Ocean"
 somali_ocean_desc: "The vast ocean to our east, it is rife with opportunity if we can claim it for ourselves, but we will not be the only ones sending ships out there to claim trade routes and mercantile chances. Our ships and sailors need to be ever present and ever vigilant of what threats there are to our extensive trading in the ocean, and when intruders try to break into the Somali Ocean despite our hegemony, we will gladly send them to the dark depths of the ocean."

 the_free_despotate: "The Free Despotate"
 the_free_despotate_desc: "Stefan Lazarevic was the first despot of Serbia, crowned with the title in 1402 by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Though this title was normally used to denote a subject state of Byzantium, the lack of power projected forth by the ruinous Byzantium meant that Stefan was able to rule on his own, making deals and decisions on his own for the good of all of Serbia. This title will be passed on from generation to generation and it will forever mark us as both an Orthodox bastion and a key state in the entirety of the Balkans."
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia: "Tenuous Diplomacy"
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia_desc: "We have had to make friends and enemies throughout all of the Balkans in order to survive. The Ottoman Empire brings with it both perilous threats but also powerful chances at greatness if we can play our cards right, but the Hungarians and Austrians to our north also provide chances at greatness elsewhere. Whatever path we choose, let us make sure that our diplomats are firmly ready to adapt to whatever situation we find ourselves in."
 hussars_of_the_hungarians: "Serbian Hussars!"
 hussars_of_the_hungarians_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is bringing with it a new age of warfare that requires us to adapt rather quickly in order to survive. Heavy cavalry with scale or plate armor is quickly becoming obsolete whilst mobility and quick strikes are becoming more and more advantageous for armies all around the Balkans. We will go along with this move to light cavalry and begin setting up our regiments of so-called 'hussars' for future battles."
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia: "Revitalize Serbia's Development"
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia_desc: "The development of Serbia as an independent bastion of Orthodox Christianity with a distinct South Slavic twist has been hampered by warfare to our south, political dealings in every direction, and attempts to expand Serbian power outward instead of consolidating power inwards. It is time that we look toward our cities like Belgrade and Novo Brdo and develop them with both libraries and schools so that our people can look to a brighter future in their own land."
 silver_mines_of_serbia: "Luxurious Silver"
 silver_mines_of_serbia_desc: "Silver mines in Serbia are some of the most prized parts of the land and we must work to keep them both productive and safe. Not only this, but minting coins and taking on the circulation of minted coinage is going to be hard for our administration, but one that will help strengthen the independent status of Serbians as a whole in the Balkans."
 serbian_vlasts: "The Vlasts of Serbia"
 serbian_vlasts_desc: "Dividing our territory into a series of districts is a bit controversial, but it's going to be needed if we are to manage Serbian lands effectively. The governors of these vlasts will of course pay fealty to the Serbian despot and through their administrative divisions, uphold certain civilian and minor military duties, thus helping project our central authority over a larger distance."
 hadjuk_irregulars: "The Help of Hajduks"
 hadjuk_irregulars_desc: "In the rural areas near the edge of Serbian borders and in places where Serbian communities are governed by a foreign power, an irregular kind of infantry is showing up time and time again. We aren't sure how the term 'Hajduk' came about, but this term for these irregular fighters is what most state call them. If we of Serbia can hire them or even integrate various Hadjuks into our military and also look into their fighting styles for our own benefit, the entirety of our military will surely become better in terms of quality and quantity."

 #Air Ideas#
 tin_hinan_of_hoggar: "Tin Hinan of Hoggar"
 tin_hinan_of_hoggar_desc: "It was under her guidance in the centuries of our past that the Tuareg people found their initial footing. Her tomb lies in the Hoggar Mountains today and we of Sultanate of Agadez (as with many other Tuareg groups) revere her and her work. By acting as she did and following in her footsteps, we too can be an example to all of the Tuareg people that we lead."
 islamic_but_relaxed: "Our Version of Islam"
 islamic_but_relaxed_desc: "Though many Tuareg communities may have adopted Islam as their own religion, there are several practices and theological aspects that we retain from before we were introduced to Islam. It is this blending of traditional Tuareg beliefs with Islamic teachings that we have come to be as we are, a widespread people encompassing a great many cities and villages as well as several trade routes."
 widespread_tuareg_connections: "Widespread Tuareg People"
 widespread_tuareg_connections_desc: "Tuareg people live in both North Africa, the Sahara, and the Sahel without worry and are often the ones that can ensure safety for trade routes that go across the great Sahara. Not only this, but Tuareg people have also settled in various cities in the north and south, making our connections even wider than others might initially think. Perhaps in places like Timbuktu, Tunis, Oran, and Bornu we will see our influence increase as time goes on."
 masters_of_the_sahara: "Masters of the Sahara"
 masters_of_the_sahara_desc: "We are indeed the undisputed masters of the Sahara and this is known by many states on the northern side and southern side. We know just how to navigate the cruel sands, how to use camels to their greatest extent, and how to conduct warfare throughout the merciless sands that fill up the barrier between North Africa and West Africa. If any wish to challenge us in our domain or elsewhere, we will use what skills we have against them."
 unify_tuareg_amenokals: "Unite the Amenokals"
 unify_tuareg_amenokals_desc: "The most paramount of chiefs in Tuareg communities is called the Amenokal, and they usually lead large confederations of Tuareg people in general. Though we are slowly changing from this traditional style of ruling over own people, the amenokals are still vital to our power and we continue to respect them in day-to-day activities, though those that swear fealty to us will need to compromise on some matters concerning governance."
 civil_servant_slavery: "Civil Servant Slavery"
 civil_servant_slavery_desc: "The Ikelan (meaning 'to be black') are a distinct slave class in Tuareg society and they sometimes live in their own separate communities from the main Tuareg community, though even then they act as civil servants and such. Acquired through raiding various states in West Africa and also through various states subject to Tuareg authority, these slaves acting as civil servants of sorts will do well in maintaining the growing economy of the Agadez Sultanate."
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy: "Reexamine Tuareg Hierarchy"
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy_desc: "For centuries the hierarchy of the Tuareg people has been unchanged due to the relatively stable nature of trade across the Sahara and the nature of cyclical politics in West Africa. But as things are changing and new concepts on society and administration are making their way into our state, we are increasingly being asked by our people to reform the old Tuareg societal hierarchy. It would take time and effort and perhaps disrupt some internal relations, but perhaps this path of reformation could be for the best if we are to sustain a lasting state for the Tuareg people."

 #Sokoto Ideas#
 SOK_ideas: "Sokoto Ideas"
 SOK_ideas_start: "Sokoto Traditions"
 SOK_ideas_bonus: "Sokoto Ambition"
 begin_the_fulani_jihad: "Jihad!"
 begin_the_fulani_jihad_desc: "The states that lie around us are impious in a number of ways and also seek to bring down our righteous caliphate from where it currently stands. We will not stand idly by as these states threaten our way of life and our thirst for Islamic scholarship, no, we will wage jihad on these kafirs and infidels! To war, my brothers and sisters, to war!"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto: "Amir al-Mu'minin"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto_desc: "Our leader is not only the religious leader who helps administrate the Islamic laws of Sokoto, but he is also the Amir al-Mu'minin, the Commander of the Faithful. Since our inception this has been the case and as time goes on, the radiant aura that stems from our Amir al-Mu'minin will help bring more people to Islam and more people to the banners of Sokoto."
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates: "The Pledge from Many Emirates"
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates_desc: "Direct annexation and conquest is by no means the only way in which Sokoto can go about extending power throughout the region of the Sahel, the lands of the Niger River, and former lands of the Mali Empire. Through establishing firm alliances and making subject states out of various people groups, Sokoto's can become more and more influential whilst also promoting various emirs to establish emirates instead of states run by kafirs."
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto: "Indirect Warfare"
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto_desc: "The forests, savannah, and dry deserts of West Africa make for an interesting landscape to fight in and the Fulani people know this for a fact. For centuries they've been more pastoral and nomadic in their ways, but since Sokoto has come about there are thousands upon thousands of Fulani people settling down in cities and taking up actual gunpowder weapons to fight with. Thus, we are learning to utilize the landscapes we've lived in for centuries with these new weapons of war."
 slave_empire_of_west_africa: "Slave Empire of West Africa"
 slave_empire_of_west_africa_desc: "The distinction between a slave and a regular person in Sokoto is different when compared to how the fiendish Europeans conduct slavery. In Sokoto and indeed in many other West African states that came before Sokoto, slavery is and was common and involved working plantations and working in the military with at least better conditions than those offered by Europeans, but still they could be sold and traded around. Being that Sokoto is as powerful as it is, the trade of slaves is going to continue in West Africa for now."
 build_up_ribats: "Ribats for the Land"
 build_up_ribats_desc: "Small fortifications to protect the growing frontier and to also protect trade routes and to act as a place of pious worship, that is what a ribat is. Though not too common in West Africa, we are going to change that around and begin building them throughout the land we hold since they are very useful in holding down land that we may find to be unruly and hard to administrate."
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship: "Islamic Scholarship Prerequisite"
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship_desc: "The caliph of Sokoto must always be educated in Islamic scholarship and not only Maliki jurisprudence, but also various other schools of Islamic jurisprudence since religious debate is going to be around in Sokoto. By ensuring that each possible candidate of ours is firmly educated in these topics related to Islam, there will be no doubt that the caliphs of Sokoto are the most pious of all Islamic leaders."

 #Tibetan Ideas#
 monasteries_of_tibet: "The Holy Sites of Tibet"
 monasteries_of_tibet_desc: "The great holy sites of Tibet are never too far away. Whether they are monasteries with religious significance or monuments with cultural traditions attached to them, Tibet is full of them and our protection of them in a unified Tibetan state only deepens our legitimacy amongst the our people. There are few who can lay claim to such piety and devotion as us."
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Great Works of Thangtong Gyalpo"
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The Iron Bridge Maker himself has left a monumental impact on Tibet and its people, so much so that many schools and sects of Tibetan Buddhism would not be where they are today if it was not for him. His great works are too many to list off, but we can rest assured that his earthly and spiritual work will never be forgotten by us."
 household_castles_for_bonpos: "Bon Dzongs"
 household_castles_for_bonpos_desc: "The older, traditional faith of Tibet still lurks around, practiced by some communities here and there but it has largely been replaced by Buddhism as a whole. Still, some practices, such as the concept of a dzong, are prevalent throughout Tibetan communities. For the dzong in particular, it is said that in the construction of a house it is in a sense making it like a castle to protect from malevolent forces outside of it. Various rituals and practices from the Bon faith go along with this of course and it helps serve to keep our people very vigilant and protective."
 the_nyingma_school: "The Nyingma School"
 the_nyingma_school_desc: "It is the oldest tradition of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and incorporates some practices and rituals from the old Bon faith. The traditions of the Nyingma school are usually passed on via loose oral networks of its practitioners and it is because of how loose it can be that others outside of our main faith can find solace in it. Though, we will always encourage them to come toward the true path of Buddhism, that will not change."
 the_kagyu_schools: "The Kagyu Schools"
 the_kagyu_schools_desc: "Born in the 11th century by Indian Mahasiddhas (someone who embodies the 'siddhi of perfection') Naropa, Maitripa, and Marpa Lotsawa, the Kagyu school grew into a number of other different sub-schools. The Karma Kagyu school, Drikung Kagyu school, Taklung Kagyu school, Shangpa Kagyu school, and the Drukpa Lineage are all children of the Kagyu tradition and with their favor and assistance in both civil and military matters, Tibet will be all the more powerful and unified."
 the_sakya_school: "The Sakya School"
 the_sakya_school_desc: "The 'pale earth' school comes from the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language in the late 1000s and was firmly established by the 'Great Sakyapa', Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. The Sakya school has a historical foundation of authority over various people unlike what others might think at first glance since, the Sakya lamas were given authority from the Yuan Dynasty to govern over Tibetan land as a vassal state of sorts. We would do good to utilize the governing capability of the Sakya religious officials as Tibet gains more ground in the world."
 the_gelug_school: "The Gelug School"
 the_gelug_school_desc: "The foundations of the Gelug school date to the life of Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) and his actions. He founded the Ganden Monastery where the Ganden Tripa is the spiritual leader of the entirey school itself, but the most influential political figure that also holds religious significance has undoubtedly been the Dalai Lama. The Gelug school stresses a variety of matters just as all schools of thought do, but the Gelug school emphasizes vinaya (monastic discipline) more so than others, and it is this disciplined attitude that we will cultivate in our hearts and minds, both in times of peace and in times of war."

 #Shan Ideas, specifically for the Shan formable itself#
 SST_ideas: "Shan Ideas"
 SST_ideas_start: "Shan Traditions"
 SST_ideas_bonus: "Shan Ambition"
 languages_around_us: "The Place of Many Languages"
 languages_around_us_desc: "All around the Shan people there are various people groups that have their own history, language, and traditions. As the Shan people go forth, it will become necessary to become more culturally understanding of these various groups no matter if they are of our own faith or not."
 centralize_the_shan_states: "Centralize the Shan States"
 centralize_the_shan_states_desc: "The various states of the Shan people have been quite decentralized throughout their history. The Pagan Kingdom attempted to round up the Shan states into a confederacy of sorts, but it barely held together for more than a few decades before falling apart. If we are to be different this time around, we must work on a central administration that can pass effective laws and be heard to the point of all Shan states answering to the central administration."
 hill_and_jungle_fights: "Highland and Tropical Warfare"
 hill_and_jungle_fights_desc: "Learning to move quickly and with intent is key to surviving in the regions that the Shan people call home. Fighting in the jungles and hills is no easy task, but it has trained our soldiers over time to make precise and calculated movements with ease. We'll be sure to use this skill against any state that seeks to stand against our intentions."
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley: "Contest for the Irrawaddy River"
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley_desc: "The great Irrawaddy River is prized by so many communities and states near the Shan people that it is not shocking to see that there are so many that would wage war over it. We are no different in this sense because we too have interest in the Irrawaddy River and what it provides. It can truly become an agricultural and commercial heart for the Shan people."
 communities_that_stand_together: "The Shan Stand Together"
 communities_that_stand_together_desc: "Through the hard times of the past and being part of various great kingdoms and dynasties, the Shan people have come to know who is friend and who is foe, but most importantly, who is their family. The Shan move and work to protect each other from those who seek to smite them down; they will not be divided again."
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders: "Chronicles of our Leaders"
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders_desc: "One consistent form of historical documenting that the Shan people have done over the centuries is that of chronicles of former leaders. Granted much of the previous ones have mythical elements embedded within them, the more recent chronicles of Shan rulers are more accurate and true-to-life. Keeping a running history of our rulers into the future will help enshrine legitimacy within the royal family."
 inter_religious_dialogue: "Encourage Religious Dialogue"
 inter_religious_dialogue_desc: "Whilst accepting different cultural traditions is one matter, accepting different faiths is another to many in the Shan administration. Our work now comes toward promoting peaceful and helpful dialogue between religious minorities and those of our true faith so that we can see them as not just filthy non-believers, but rather people deserving of peace and prosperity like so many others."

 #Moroccan Ideas#
 al_qarawiyyin_university: "University of al-Qarawiyyin"
 al_qarawiyyin_university_desc: "Founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 in Fez, the past dynasties of Morocco have kept the university as a madrasa and as a place for higher education. With a great accumulation of manuscripts, texts, scholars, students, and worshippers from all over the Islamic world and beyond, it is in our best interest to keep the university open to all in our domain. Not only this, but we should also expand it when and where possible so that our strive for educational prowess is never hindered."
 pious_past: "Pious Past"
 pious_past_desc: "Morocco has been the seat of the Almoravid Dynasty and the Almohad Caliphate from centuries past; not only this, but the Fatimid Caliphate and the Caliphate of Cordoba also attempted to garner influence in Moroccan lands before as well. Such piety that has been imbued within our people should not go unnoticed by us in our current state for we have the foundation to become a truly wondrous Islamic bastion in the west. On the frontier of Africa and the Islamic world, Morocco will stand tall and as an example to many."
 fleet_bases_of_morocco: "Fleet Bases in Morocco"
 fleet_bases_of_morocco_desc: "The inland parts of Morocco are arid and hot to a good degree, but the coasts are where value can be found at little cost. Fleet bases and dockyards fit for a burgeoning and expanding navy is what Morocco has needed and will need in order to survive. Threats to the north and to the east are going to utilize the wide open coasts against us, let us see to it that they are not given up without a great fight out on the water first!"
 promote_corsair_efforts: "Promote Corsair Efforts"
 promote_corsair_efforts_desc: "Pirates and corsairs of the North African coast, they take no mercy on their enemies and rule the waves in which they call their own. Morocco has historically been a good haven for them since contracts can be made with said corsairs against the Christian north. By utilizing them even more in the future, we'll stand a better change at defeating any enemies we have out at sea."
 revered_and_honored_leaders: "Revere Our Leaders"
 revered_and_honored_leaders_desc: "It is right and just that we look up to the past leaders of Morocco, those who once stood tall against threats to our people and helped the region itself prosper despite the challenges set forth. As new great leaders come and go for the Moroccan people, we should build a proper tomb complex so that they are never forgotten by future generations and so that their tales and stories may live on well after they have left this physcial world."
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes: "Centralize Authority; Curtail the Tribes"
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes_desc: "The tension between ethnic Moroccans and ethnic Berbers, its constant issue that we will need to deal with somehow. Tribal connections are present all throughout Morocco and they can play a huge role in politics as we have seen in the past, but we should not be afraid of trying to rein in said tribes. Centralizing power and authority is going to be crucial to keeping the internal aspects of Morocco stable and prosperous."

 #Portuguese Ideas#
 dom_henry_the_navigator: "Infante D. Henrique of Portugal"
 dom_henry_the_navigator_desc: "The central figure to the Portuguese people that is Henrique of Portugal (also known as Prince Henry the Navigator) should be revered by both the people and our administration. His acts of developing early maritime trade for the Portuguese Empire would help initiate and sow the seeds for the Age of Exploration. Along with this, he would help lay the foundation for our rise onto the world stage of international politics."
 feitorias: "Feitorias!"
 feitorias_desc: "What better way to facilitate trade than to open up what is essentially a Portuguese-founded entrepot for trade activity? It will not only bolster our own trading prowess and power abroad, but it will also also help increase our influence over sea routes and land routes that surround the feitoria. Lining our pockets with coins from the world over will become easier than ever before!"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade: "Naval Bases and the Slave Trade"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade_desc: "To help secure our hold on trade power in various sectors and to help facilitate the rather profitable slave trade, we will need a variety of naval bases scattered about on our coastal holdings. Portuguese ships will be able to resupply and repair at these bases before going back off to patrol trade routes, engage in overseas conflicts, or carry forth the wonders of Portuguese trade."
 lucrative_gold_exploits: "Lucrative Gold Exploits"
 lucrative_gold_exploits_desc: "Now that gold is streaming into our administration, we will need to spend it wisely. Investing the gold into production techniques that go forth to extracting more from the land (especially precious metals) will benefit Portugal very nicely in the future without compromising the economic integrity of our state. At least, that is what we hope."
 the_bandeirantes_of_portugal: "Bandeirantes of Portugal"
 the_bandeirantes_of_portugal_desc: "Our colonial holdings are far from home, that is obvious, but what is less obvious to people is just how much freedom some of the military officials and administrators have. The land is spread out, less populated than our own land in Iberia, and ready for explorers of every kind to venture out with small retinues of troops to claim land and find mineral wealth. So what if the native people get in the way, they can be rounded up and serve the colonial administration or they can die trying stave us off; even the latter gives us a benefit in training our colonial regiments in warfare of varying terrains."
 #portuguese_marines: "Portuguese Marines"
 #portuguese_marines_desc: "With the advent of overseas wars and conflicts, the Portuguese infantry (more specifically, the Portuguese marines) need to be well versed in how to attack and defend in a variety of situations. From amphibious invasions and defenses in a number of harrowing conditions, they will be hardened and trained well in fending off any who dare make war with the Portuguese."
 portuguese_inquisition: "The Portuguese Inquisition"
 portuguese_inquisition_desc: "And to subjugate the land further in favor our noble and righteous authority, bringing forth the knowledge of Christ to new land we seize is what will be done. We must and will hold divine authority over the land we hold and the people will know this in their hearts and souls without the slightest of derivation."
 secure_the_trade_monopolies: "Securing Trade Monopolies"
 secure_the_trade_monopolies_desc: "The other Europeans would have the Portuguese ousted out of the competition on the high seas, they would keep the trade routes to themselves and force us into economic submission! We cannot let this happen or even begin to happen! We must be ready at all times with a grand fleet to keep our trade companies, colonies, and overseas charters safe from the clutches of other Europeans!"

 #Greek Ideas, specifically for Greece itself#
 GRE_ideas: "Greek Ideas"
 GRE_ideas_start: "Greek Traditions"
 GRE_ideas_bonus: "Greek Ambition"
 rememeber_the_strato_da_mar: "Remember the 'Stato da Màr'"
 rememeber_the_strato_da_mar_desc: "The Republic of Venice is powerful indeed and has held sway over several key parts of the Adriatic Sea as well as the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterannean Sea. Though the time of Venice in the glory of the sun is coming to an end, the work they did in Greek lands is certainly not. The prosperity they kept in Greek islands as well as Greek mainland towns is what we are striving to keep alive and well. This in turn is leading us to promote a more expansive navy and a wider range of potential trade partners."
 protect_byzantine_arts: "Protect Byzantine Art and Architecture"
 protect_byzantine_arts_desc: "It was during the 10th century to approximately the time of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 that the revival of Byzantine art occurred in the lands of Greece. Mainland Greece certainly benefited from this revival since it was endowed with many great churches and cathedrals, but we must not rest yet! These sacred and beautiful places are always in danger of being raided and destroyed by invaders and thus we must protect what gives us lasting prestige and beauty."
 greek_resistance: "Greek Resistance"
 greek_resistance_desc: "When the Turkish forces came in from the east, many Greeks did not simply bow down to their onslaught and conquering emirs and pashas. They stayed reserved and hidden away, selectively peaking out to struggle against the Turkish forces so that they were not completely decimated. This resistant Greek spirit lives on without end to this very day no matter who the invader is or where they come from."
 diaspora_of_greek_people: "The Greek Diaspora"
 diaspora_of_greek_people_desc: "The Turks not only conquered our territory, but they also helped make for a great exodus of Greek people from the mainland. Toward the rest of Europe did they head off to, serving in other courts around Europe in the hopes that one day they may return home and serve a truly Greek state. That time has now come and as they arrive back, our good name will spread around the likes of Europe without failure."
 lifted_from_the_ground_up: "From the Depths of Poverty"
 lifted_from_the_ground_up_desc: "As Turkish authority tightened on Greeks, the rules also tightened in certain areas, leading to Greeks becoming impoverished and left to worse conditions than how they were after the Fourth Crusade. Now that we can sustain ourselves and function properly, the Greek people will come back up from the depths of poverty and rise back to the urban cities that they once knew. Coastal trade centers will come back to life and our once grand cities will know splendor like never before."
 revival_of_greek_thinking: "Revival of Greek Intellect"
 revival_of_greek_thinking_desc: "Greece as a region has been the center of many great philosophical innovations as well as the site of great advances in ancient and classical technologies. Honoring this past by promoting Greek intellect in schools and universities will put the Greek people back on the map of scientific and philosophical innovation."
 enduring_heritage: "Enduring Heritage"
 enduring_heritage_desc: "No matter who they were in the past, no invader could dislodge and remove Greek culture from the land. Try as they might to spread it thin or shift it from the great cities of Athens, Sparta, Thessaly, and many others, these foreign occupants have done nothing but further contribute to the enduring legacy and heritage of the Greek people. We are without perfection, that much is certain, but we are not without the greatest living spirit in all of Europe."

 #Galician Ideas#
 santiago_de_compostela: "Santiago de Compostela"
 santiago_de_compostela_desc: "Inside our great city of Santiago de Compostela is the hallowed cathedral in which the Way of St. James ends at. A pilgramage sight for Christians in several communities inside and outside our borders, Santiago de Compostela will serve as the foundational place by which Galicia rises up and in the world. Few will be able to match our piety and honor and we will use this to our advantage."
 reestablish_the_bishoprics: "Reestablish the Bishoprics"
 reestablish_the_bishoprics_desc: "In the time of the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, the old bishoprics of Galicia were not just religious authorities that Galicia communities looked up to, but they were also political players that meddled in matters of governance normally reserved for dukes and kings; some bishoprics were even seen as warlords since they could wield the weapons of levied armies in opposition to others around them. Reviving these old bishoprics could be very beneficial to Galicia as a whole, but we will need to keep a very tight leash on them so that they do not destabilize the state as a whole."
 claimant_of_iberia: "Claimant of Iberia"
 claimant_of_iberia_desc: "Many have forgotten the times when Galicia was a true power in Iberia. Many simply see Castile, Aragon, and Portugal as the crowned powers that shall hold Iberia in its entirety, but Galicians are not bound to this destiny by any means. The chains imposed by the crown of Castile and the subsequent power grabs by all three aforementioned powers will not stay for long, for Galicia will take to the sword and musket to break free. Iberia will not stay silent, it will be contested for!"
 attracting_christian_pilgrims: "Attracting Christian Pilgrims"
 attracting_christian_pilgrims_desc: "Santiago de Compostela may be Christian pilgramage site, but times have changed and there are plenty of people outside of Iberia that have forgotten or who do not know of the Way of St. James. Let us send envoys out to various lands across Europe and beyond to encourage people to visit our land so that they can know not just the beauty and wonder of Galician land, but also the piety of its people from all walks of life."
 galician_town_charters: "Galician Town Charters"
 galician_town_charters_desc: "To help organize city growth and city planning, we should take to heart the notion of town charters that was taken up by our past rulers. Such town charters will allow for more careful and closer governance so that cities are not left to manage themselves in an unregulated fashion. In time, aspects like city councils, guilds, and social mobility will be a reality within Galician towns."
 revive_compostela_for_galicia: "Revive Compostela"
 revive_compostela_for_galicia_desc: "Some may say Santiago de Compostela is a lonesome city in the hills and that it is a wasteland, but those people know not of what they say! Though the city is not as grand as say, Toledo or Barcelona, it still has great potential for economic growth and urbanization. Promoting its regal status from before and funding new infrastructure projects that can turn the communtiies within into functioning and profitable sectors will help bring not only the area around Santiago de Compostela into greatness, but Galicia as a whole."
 power_of_the_irmandinos: "The Irmandinos!"
 power_of_the_irmandinos_desc: "When people think to the Irmandino Revolts, some think they were just rowdy peasants who wanted the heads of nobles whilst others look to them as heroes of the lower classes. It would be beneficial to Galicia to paint them in a more heroic light so that those troops that we levy and train from rural communities are more inspired to fight for Galicia. We certainly do not want a second set of Irmandino Revolts, but we also must learn to harness the tenacity and will that those once brave fighters had in themselves."

 #Danish Ideas#
 sound_toll_defense: "Sound Toll Defense"
 sound_toll_defense_desc: "We control a great amount of trade power thanks to the Sound Toll and it makes up a decent portion of our trade revenue inside of the core of Denmark. If we are to see ourselves secure and prosperous, we need to first make sure the walls of our beating heart are safe from all harm."
 margrets_kalmar_legacy: "The Legacy of the Kalmar Union"
 margrets_kalmar_legacy_desc: "The Kalmar Union that was instituted by the great Margaret I of Denmark has had its rough spots, certainly, but it is not without its lasting legacy on the land. The lands of Scandinavia have been disunited for several decades before our time, but we must have the strength and the will to see to it that the region is united! The Danish people already look to its royal administration with great pride, it is time that we ensure that pride stays in their hearts and minds."
 danish_economic_overhaul: "Economic Overhaul of Denmark"
 danish_economic_overhaul_desc: "The way we have done finances up until now has been rather disorganized and fairly decentralized; some say it is why Denmark has been unable to project its power outward like it was once able to in the times of Cnut the Great. These ways of decentralized finances must be done away with! An economic overhaul internally in the administration and in the naval sector (since the latter is a large part of our expenses) is necessary so that our treasury and our salaries are dealt with on equal ground by educated and skilled workers."
 claims_across_the_north: "Ancestral Claims in the North"
 claims_across_the_north_desc: "From the Danelaw in the British Isles to the lands of Scandinavia itself and even parts of the eastern Baltic Sea, Denmark remembers what it had in the past. Trade posts and conquered territory alike, the Danish will obtain what it once lost so long ago and soon, all of the northern lands will see just how powerful we are. What we must refine in our conquests though, is how we take in and govern foreign people so that they are not revolted by how we speak, write, and conduct business on a day-to-day basis."
 northern_trade_hegemon: "Northern Trade Hegemon"
 northern_trade_hegemon_desc: "The trade routes of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are absolutely key to the survival of the Danish economy and we have always been a solid contender for controlling both regions. The Hanseatic League, the English, the Swedish, and the Russians all seek to tie down Denmark in terms of trade, but we must work against them effectively to steer trade contracts and trade ships into our favor."
 the_question_to_us_christians: "Questions of Faith"
 the_question_to_us_christians_desc: "Faith has been key to the people of Denmark for a very long time, but so as the dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church itself. We must ask ourselves harrowing questions on what path we will choose as the Protestant Reformation goes forth: What teachings will guide us? What theology is even remotely correct? What will the political outcome be if choose a certain faith over another? Whatever we choose amidst the fire and smoke, the Danish people will surely be happy with it."
 legal_overhaul: "Legal Reformation and Compilation"
 legal_overhaul_desc: "To keep up with continuous technological advances as well as administrative reforms, a comprehensive legal code that can be revised as time goes on should be made and distributed across Denmark to other administrative sectors so that laws can be enforced as much as possible."

 #Ayutthaya Ideas#
 mandala_system_ayu: "The Mandala System"
 mandala_system_ayu_desc: "Through the mandala system of governance, we are able to take hold of areas extending outward from our central city. These various places under our mandala system, they must pay tribute to our capital regularly and contribute military forces to the mutual defense when needed. What we need to watch for is when these parts of our mandala system begin to get restless and hungry for power; such ambitions could easily rip the kingdom apart."
 hindu_buddhist_kingship: "Hindu and Buddhist Kingship"
 hindu_buddhist_kingship_desc: "Gone are the days of paternal kingship as was found when King Ramkhamhaeng of Sukhothai ruled the land. Our ruler, the 'chakkraphat', shall take upon traditions and customs from both Buddhism and Hinduism and combines them into one elegant being that will make the world revolve around him so long as he adheres to the laws of the land."
 institute_the_uparaja_position: "Institute the Uparaja Position"
 institute_the_uparaja_position_desc: "To help us govern and to help secure the succession to the throne of Ayutthaya, we should make room for a sort of viceroy/prince. In addition to this position, we should give favor to the king's children, preferably the eldest son, so that he can learn to govern in accordance with his father and the court around him."
 influx_of_trade_links: "Influx of Trade Links"
 influx_of_trade_links_desc: "Our capital of Ayutthaya is a place of immense trade and great prosperity. With people from China, India, and other places around us and even beyond us coming to the capital for trade deals, we should be ready to negotiate at any point so that the revenue stream of our kingdom is only ever increasing. Business never stops flowing in Ayutthaya, that is surely one key aspect of it."
 need_for_the_corvee_system: "A New Manpower System"
 need_for_the_corvee_system_desc: "Wars in South East Asia are often decided not by technological differences, but by who has the larger army in battle. To supply our armies and to ensure that we always have the larger military force at the ready, we need to institute a new system called the 'corvee system'. With some captured people being brought back to serve in various position on the lower rungs of society, Ayutthaya will have a consistent supply of manpower to draw upon."
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code: "The Dharmasastra Legal Code"
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code_desc: "To help govern the land, we should draw upon not only Thai traditions but also on Hindu customs too since they have been very influential in the history of the Thai people as a whole. We may not adopt the caste system that is prevalent out in the west, but we should adopt a bureaucracy of officials set in a heirarchy that can be managed and maintained by the administration of Ayutthaya."
 center_of_thai_literature_production: "Center of Thai Literature"
 center_of_thai_literature_production_desc: "With our splendid governance over the land, it should be no surprise that the people in villages and cities are becoming more and more creative. Literature in the Thai tradition may have been slow to develop before our time, but we have essentially broken the barrier that stood in the way of our people before, allowing them to flourish in writing various poetic literature in the 'rai', 'khlong', and 'klon' forms."

 #Ilkhanid Ideas#
 restoration_of_the_past: "A New Age of Ilkhans"
 restoration_of_the_past_desc: "Founded by Hulagu Khan, son of Tolui and grandson of Ghengis Khan, in 1256, the Ilkhanate ruled much of what was the southwestern portion of the once grand Mongol Empire. It was an empire that held tenuous power over the region of Persia and neighboring areas to the west and north, but its power was great enough to continuously challenge the Mamluk Sultanate for control of the Levant. Still, the Ilkhans were subordinate to the Great Khan of the east situated at the head of the Yuan Dynasty, but this is no longer the case. Our leader is no longer subservient to a far away khan, but rather leads the empire on his own accord."
 internal_tolerance: "Promote Internal Tolerance"
 internal_tolerance_desc: "From Hulagu to Baydu, the Ilkhans were relatively indifferent to religions though they kept Buddhism around in Persian lands for quite some time despite the region being majority Islamic in essence. It was not until Baydu's overthrowing by Ghazan that Islam was adopted as the official faith of the Ilkhanate in 1295 (after a majority of Mongol emirs had already converted to Islam), though it was not until the death of the influential Mongol emir Nawruz that religious tolerance was achieved to a great degree. We would be wise to learn from Nawruz's failures and flaws and work to consistently improve upon our religious tolerance."
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry: "Improve our Scientific Outlook"
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry_desc: "A great observatory in Maragheh was built by the early Ilkhans, though since then chaos has reigned throughout the region and as such scientific inquiry has been left to gather dust in a lonely corner. With our establishment of power in the region and the coming about of the Ilkhanate once more, we could easily patronize and rework our inquiry into scientific matters since times of peace and stability will help keep great buildings like observatories and libraries intact and functional."
 versed_mongolian_conquests: "Versed in Mongolian Conquests"
 versed_mongolian_conquests_desc: "Though the Mongol Empire may be gone and fragmented beyond repair to many, what is not gone is the way the Mongol Empire conquered people and eased them into the fold of other conquered people. We would do well to learn and possibly refine this method of conquest as time goes on so that the Ilkhanate can continue to project its power in the future whilst also ensuring an easier path to peace for our realm."
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts: "Inspiration from Mahmud Ghazan"
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts_desc: "Mahmud Ghazan was not only the first Islamic Ilkhan, but he was also a very capable and well-meaning ruler. During his reign, he reformed Ilkhanid finances and fiscal policy (including unified measurements of coinage and weights), issued a new census for the empire, ordered the construction of new hospitals, hostels, schools, and posts for trade, and he also reformed the way in which edicts in the empire's administration were handled. Emulating this reform-minded nature of Ghazan is going to be hard to do, but to keep the Ilkhanate alive is to look to the future and actively engage with it, not to rely purely on the past."
 zamburak_cavalry_arm: "Develop Zamburak Cavalry"
 zamburak_cavalry_arm_desc: "Whilst holding the title of 'Ilkhan' is important as it lends legitimacy in our reign, it is important that we do not stay stagnant in military strategy like our ancestors may have. Persian lands make heavy and large cannons hard to carry around, so we must devise new ways of incorporating gunpowder weapons into our ranks. One innovative invention is what some call the 'Zamburak', literally meaning 'wasp', and it is a swivel-mounted small cannon mounted on the back of camels. Utilizing them in our military will greatly improve our effectiveness in future battles and can be seen as an evolution of our ancestors tactics."
 reformed_yam_system: "Reformed Yam System"
 reformed_yam_system_desc: "Much like how Mahmud Ghazan improved upon the Yam system in his time, we too will take to improving it in our time. Constructing more dedicated and central roads for messengers, merchants, civilians, and military personnel to travel on as well as building up new relay stations along the way for our people will ensure that the roads are efficient enough for us. Not only this, but we will employ people to maintain the roads over time so that they do not wither away into impassable patches of land."

 #Hungarian Ideas#
 order_of_the_dragon: "The Order of the Dragon"
 order_of_the_dragon_desc: "Founded in 1408 by Sigismund von Luxembourg, King of Hungary at the time, the Order of the Dragon was a chivalric order founded whilst the crusaders were still ongoing. The initiates were required to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christanity, especially the Ottoman Empire since they were the biggest threat back then. Though they are declining in importance as time goes on, their legacy gives our troops and military a zeal unlike those around us. Who is to say that the Order of the Dragon is ever truly dead?"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage: "Learn to not Debase Coinage"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage_desc: "Whilst Sigismund von Luxembourg was active in the defense of Hungary and its foreign policy, these activities and engagements required great amounts of money. They required so much money that Sigismund regularly debased currency to the point where Transylvanian peasants revolted in 1438. We need to learn to never step toward this path again, and to ensure that our monarch can handle financial matters in a just way that does not invoke rebellious sentiment."
 southern_contention_with_turks: "Southern Tension"
 southern_contention_with_turks_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is an existential threat to the Kingdom of Hungary, none doubt that. The southern border with them is almost always in contention and it is rare that we are not involved in some sort of conflict against the Ottoman Empire. Should the time come, we need to ensure that our military is large enough and strong enough to withstand any prolonged war against the fiends to the south."
 bibliotheca_corviniana: "Library of Hungary Royalty"
 bibliotheca_corviniana_desc: "We recognize the importance of the manuscripts and texts being produced as a result of the Renaissance and many courtiers and nobles are collecting them for future keeping and reading. If we can perhaps build up a royal library of sorts to store these grand texts and manuscripts, we'll be able to attract more people to read about them and become educated on various matters, contributing to the ongoing scholarly dialogue in Hungary."
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms: "The Importance of Gunpowder"
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms_desc: "With gunpowder weapons becoming more and more common, it is becoming clear to all of Hungary that refining the art of making firearms and implementing them formally into our military is needed. If we lack in this aspect, we will be vulnerable to invasions as well as rebellions, possibly even from the Black Army itself if things get to that point."
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes: "Organize Hungarian Taxes"
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes_desc: "The traditional tax laws of Hungary are quite outdated and needlessly complex, having not been changed in decades now. We can refine and streamline them into something more suited to a growing kingdom so that revenue is not only increased, but also easier to manage in general."
 institute_the_decretum_maius: "Institute the 'Decretum Maius'"
 institute_the_decretum_maius_desc: "We have known just how much power the palatine (a high level official in our court) has over judicial matters. The power he has is seen by some to be just, but many of the court know that it is a needless stumbling block that we have had to work around for a long time. It is time that we institute the 'Decretum Maius' and officially cut down the power of the palatine and instead strengthen county magistrates instead since they are the ones that work close with the lower classes of Hungary. This will help bolster our administrative capabilities far into the future."

 #Cascadian Ideas#
 integration_of_native_tribes: "Cascadian Acceptance"
 integration_of_native_tribes_desc: "Unlike other places around the vast continent we lie on, we of Cascadia are not so keen on destroying the lives and communities of native people who already live in these lands. We would rather assimilate them and do good trade with them so that Cascadia can be at peace and also prosper from mutual cooperation. Though this won't always be easy to do, it is much better than ruthlessly excluding all natives from our land."
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures: "Expansive Trade and Production"
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures_desc: "Trade is essentially what Cascadia was founded upon, and production of furs as well as other minor resources is what we also partly rely on to keep us afloat. By taking the time to refine our methods of trade and production we can meet the demands that overseas markets have such as across the Pacific Ocean and even across this vast continent we live on."
 frontier_settler_traditions: "Settling the Frontier"
 frontier_settler_traditions_desc: "Cascadia's land is by no means easy to traverse the further you go toward the mountains. Settlers braved these uncharted trails and setup small villages that grew in size to upstart towns and cities, but these foundational times were also filled with dangers from wildlife and hostile natives. All Cascadians willing to settle the frontier will need to be versed in firearms and survival training, and we know that many will strive for this training since the frontier is a lucrative place for those daring enough to venture into it."
 cascade_mountains: "The Cascade Mountains"
 cascade_mountains_desc: "Tall and steep mountains mark the barrier between the western coast of these lands and the great interior plains where wide open tracts of land are roamed by a variety of people. Traversing the Cascade Mountains requires endurance, stamina, and keen senses, for an ambush from enemy forces could start a deadly skirmish in the perilous heights. Not only this, but surviving off what the land can provide is also needed when moving through the Cascade Mountain, which is why most of our soldiers are also capable hunters and survivalists."
 puget_sound_trade_rights: "Our Pacific Inlet"
 puget_sound_trade_rights_desc: "The inlet on the Pacific Ocean that Cascadia relies heavily upon is becoming more and more popular as time goes on. Trading vessels from all across the Pacific Ocean and even from the Atlantic Ocean stop by in our friendly ports along the sides of the inlet, garnering us more trade revenue, so why not impose some trade taxes and such? We can slowly start projecting our power off the Cascadian coast and ensure that our harbors are even safer, promoting stronger trade ties and attracting even more merchants later on."
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean: "Extensive Naval Matters"
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean_desc: "Without a fleet of some kind, Cascadia will simply be only half as strong as it really could be. We need to promote naval affairs and the production of ships throughout Cascadia's coast so that we are not left to the mercy of foreign powers and what ships they might have. Plus, the plentiful forests in our land will make for a great amount of material for future ships."
 to_govern_a_hinterland: "To Govern a Hinterland"
 to_govern_a_hinterland_desc: "Cascadia was, when it was a colony still, governed as if it were a hinterland (meaning a place where resources are extracted and shipped off elsewhere far away in order to be processed and refined). Now that we are free from the greedy hands of our former overlords, we can work on governing Cascadia for Cascadians solely. We can address the needs of our people and work on government reforms and legislation at our own pace, ensuring that we are accountable to the people we protect and care for."

 #Sonoran Ideas#
 logistics_of_sonoran_land: "Logistics of Sonora"
 logistics_of_sonoran_land_desc: "To move supplies and materials around Sonoran land is something of an issue for those not used to the region since, well, the arid heat can often lead to people slowing down and animals as well as people suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion. Taking all of this into account and setting up supply stations as well as carving out designated paths throughout the arid lands we inhabit will help cut down how costly moving supplies around is."
 promises_of_future_revenue: "We Promise Future Fortune"
 promises_of_future_revenue_desc: "Whilst not all of Sonora can be used right now, we are developing infrastructure in various places to promote larger and more numerous settlements. Garnering investors for this initiative is not going to be easy, but if we can start a campaign that promises future revenue from these places in exchange for a grant of money and resources now, we will be able to expand Sonora's internal source of revenue and power."
 gold_of_sonora: "Gold Attraction"
 gold_of_sonora_desc: "If it was not for gold and other precious minerals, Sonora would not be what it is today. Indeed the allure of wealth from gold has brought many to Sonora and made them stay indefinitely, but we are much smarter than our former overlords who once governed over us, for we are not just going to let the gold miners run our economics into the ground through inflation. Instead, we will take a firm economic approach that is intent on mitigating inflation as much as possible."
 rifle_riders_of_sonora: "Sonoran Rifle Riders"
 rifle_riders_of_sonora_desc: "Muskets and rifles are what rule these lands now; the old ways of spears and arrows used by the native people is long gone. Our people, both civilian and military in nature, are going to be expected to be able to handle muskets and rifles with care and fire them with precision, and our formal core of officers and commanders are going to be well versed in how to utilize cavalry and infantry fighting in hot Sonoran lands with long range weaponry. Getting up close and personal is something we do not want to do."
 resist_authority_from_afar: "In Defense of Sonora"
 resist_authority_from_afar_desc: "Putting up fortifications like walls of stone throughout Sonora is hard enough as it is as they take a long time to build and require immense amounts of water and food to maintain, but the ones we do have are going to be absolutely pivotal for our defense. Any invaders looking to ravage our lands are going to have to get through our fortifications guarding vital rivers and streams, and even our own towns will be equipped with at least some form of defensive structures like watchtowers or fortified outposts."
 slow_but_steady_growth: "Showing Promise"
 slow_but_steady_growth_desc: "From our inception as a colony, the lands here in Sonora did not look good for widespread settlement and even to this day we find large tracts of land open to the howling wilderness and baking heat of the sun. But, we have grown immensely since our inception and our independence, and we are working toward building a strong, unified Sonoran state that few if any could break down. No matter how far apart they are, Sonoran people will stand united together, with hands together for celebrations and hands on rifles when defending."
 the_politics_of_sonora: "Sonoran Politics"
 the_politics_of_sonora_desc: "The stabilization of Sonoran politics is perhaps the most key aspect of keeping this state together since, if our politics are not stable and different factions lead different parts of the country, they can easily rip apart the population's loyalty as a whole. Formalizing political parties, how people are represented, and how officials will be elected will ensure that the blooming Sonoran state continues to prosper."

 #Crimean Ideas#
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde: "Unjust Reprisals in Crimea"
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde_desc: "In the 1300s and early 1400s, the khans of the Golden Horde used Crimea as a playground of sorts, riding through and striking down various communities when civil war was brewing and forcing people into military service when they initially refused. We have been taught to always be ready for whatever war or conflict may come our way, and our weapons are always within reach for when we need to defend what is rightfully outs."
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure: "The Withering Horde of Gold"
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure_desc: "Without the influence from the Golden Horde, the khans of Crimea can live freely and without much worry. They failures in politics and military organization that led to the downfall of the Golden Horde are opening paths for us to make gains in the east toward Sarai, so why not take the chance and stake our claim in the land whilst our old overlords are struggling to survive?"
 legitimacy_in_blood: "Legitimacy, through Blood"
 legitimacy_in_blood_desc: "Succession in the Crimean Khanate is bathed in blood for the most part. The heir chosen by the current khan is going to need to fight for his life if he wishes to maintain the throne, and it is this display of power and might through combat that instills legitimacy in our heirs when they come to power. If a khan cannot lead an army into battle and win effectively, then what good is he?"
 turkish_friends: "Turkish Friends"
 turkish_friends_desc: "The Turkish people of Anatolia are strong in their conviction and powerful with their military and navy. They have taken interest in our lands before but not for pure conquest; instead they seem more interested in utilizing us on a more one-to-one scale. Making friends with the Turkish people will undoubtedly help us in the long run and give us more routes of diplomacy for the Islamic world, despite it being still quite far from home."
 refining_our_trained_cavalry: "Refine Crimean Cavalry"
 refining_our_trained_cavalry_desc: "Firearms are what we will need if we seek to survive into the coming era. Equipping our cavalry with firearms and training them to fire and reload them effectively is not going to be easy, but with the help of Turkish military officials and a sustained effort on our own part, we can cultivate a cavalry arm that is more effective than any other."
 black_sea_slave_trade: "Profits from the Slave Trade"
 black_sea_slave_trade_desc: "The slave trade is partly how we make our money since, raiding and looting Christian lands is so easy at times and there are plenty of buyers on the market throughout the Black Sea. Continuing the slave trade and perhaps investing in it elsewhere should continue to help our people profit nicely."
 cossack_friends: "Cossacks? Cossacks!"
 cossack_friends_desc: "What is a 'cossack' to us Crimeans? Are they enemies, or are they friends? Beyond border disputes and some petty squabbles, the cossacks are remarkably similar to our people in their military prowess organization. If we can establish effective diplomatic ties with the various cossack groups throughout the Pontic Steppe and bring some into our fold, our military will be unmatched in how effective it is and how fluid it can be in times of war."

 #Ottoman Ideas#
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet: "Kapu Kulu & Eyalet Organization"
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet_desc: "The military forces of Europeans and Muslims around us are something that we should not only learn from, but also strive to be above as time goes on. Organizing our military into two sections, a central force and a peripheral force, will help with this and instill a sense of discipline in the core part of our military as well as the outer part since both will be relied upon as we continue our fight into Europe, Africa, and Asia."
 spahi_cavalry: "Sipahi Cavalry"
 spahi_cavalry_desc: "Cavalry has been a key component of our military since the time we were a mere Beylik. Our ancestors of the Seljuk Empire even depolyed Sipahi cavalry which attests to the history of the unit itself, but we of the Ottoman Empire are in a much different time compared to our ancestors. Our Sipahi must learn more skilled strategies and tactics, how to use gunpowder weapons whilst on their horses, and also how to conduct themselves in line with our Janissaries and artillery."
 turkish_artillery: "Ottoman Artillery"
 turkish_artillery_desc: "Whilst the Europeans and other Muslim states around us progress very little in terms of gunpowder technology, we are absolutely keen on using the fiery material to its greatest extent! Grenades, weapons that are larger than muskets but smaller than cannons, even cannons that seem almost too big to even be fired properly, all of this will be utilized and tried out by the Ottoman military. Only the best designs will survive the test of time and this strive for gunpowder prowess will make our artillery outdo anything Europe or Asia can put forth."
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets: "Of Pashas and Eyalets"
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets_desc: "Setting up strong administrative divisions will be key in governing our growing empire. Pashas and Eyalets can be where we start from and from there, further organization can commend and bring a sense of unity to far off lands under our control; we just need to make sure we keep track of these various pashas and eyalets so that corruption does not get out of hand."
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate: "From Karamursel Onward"
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate_desc: "When we took Karamursel, our fleet was small and not able to compete with the likes of Venice or other powers in the Mediterranean Sea. Now that it has been under our control for a long while and our navy has been building up in a variety of ways, Karamursel will become the nucleus of our various fleet, allowing us to field a great amount of galleys and merchant ships that can take on the likes of Venice and Genoa."
 multi_functional_spahis: "Sipahi Funcationality"
 multi_functional_spahis_desc: "The professional Sipahi cavalry are not just used in combat; unlike the Janissaries, the Sipahi are also given grants of land called 'timars' and are expected to enforce law and order in these lands they are given. As a sort of informal police force of sorts yet also an effective cavalry force, the Sipahi variable role in the Ottoman Empire means that we will need more of them as time goes on, especially as our empire continues to expand into new areas."
 claim_the_caliphate: "The Ottoman Caliphate"
 claim_the_caliphate_desc: "Few if any in the Muslim world have reached our height and claimed as much power as we currently have. The piety in our rulers and the power we are gathering as time goes on should show all in the Islamic world that we, the Ottoman Empire, are the true protectors of Muslims from outside forces. Though some Islamic states would defy our righteous authority, in time they will submit to our authority either through peaceful talks or the fires of war."

 #Prussian Ideas#
 confluence_of_poland_and_hre: "At the Confluence of Two"
 confluence_of_poland_and_hre_desc: "The lands of Prussia are in a precarious position as it is. To the south lie the Poles, historically strong and stalwart in their ways and certainly a threat to Prussia; to the west lie the domains of our humble beginning, the Holy Roman Empire, a place of great prestige and also great tension and bloodshed. We of Prussia need to work on making sure both avenues are safe and secure diplomatically, and when intrigue or opportunity arises that we can take advantage of, we will strike whilst the iron is hot and take what land we can no matter how small."
 two_lands_ruled_as_one: "Two Lands, Ruled as One"
 two_lands_ruled_as_one_desc: "There are some outside of Prussia who see our lands as divided into two: one part inside the domain of the Holy Roman Empire and one part outside of it, thus necessitating our authority being over two lands technically. Whilst we don't really see it like this we can at least acknowledge that this is the case on paper and employ an array of diplomats to negotiate deals inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire."
 the_renewed_cross_of_prussia: "The Renewed Cross of Prussia"
 the_renewed_cross_of_prussia_desc: "The dark days of being burdened by the words of a far off Papacy are no longer around, are they? Prussia as a whole has come to learn that there are ways to think about the world and universe that are contrary to the common theology and doctrine touted by Catholics and these different ways of thinking about religious matters shouldn't be persecuted on sight. Instead, we can learn from them and be empowered by them whilst still keeping our relative distance away from the Papacy both theologically and spiritually."
 secular_politics_abound: "Push to Secularize"
 secular_politics_abound_desc: "Secular politics is new to some states but we know it all too well. Our early leaders knew just how key it was to start bringing politics away from the days of the Teutonic Knights of old and more toward a non-religious and grounded method. If we can continue this, we'll be able to govern more people without issue and also keep them from straying away from the legislation we pass."
 integrate_the_junkers: "Junkers Wanted; Junkers Needed"
 integrate_the_junkers_desc: "Landed nobility inside the lands of Prussia hold a great amount of power and it is easy for most anyone to see this. From politics to the economy itself, Junkers could very well be our downfall if they come under the influence of foreigners or if they become disobedient to our authority. That is why we are going to start earnest conversations and negotiations with the Junkers of Prussia to integrate them into the military instead of having them just doing as they please on their various estates."
 attention_to_the_jagers: "Jagers!"
 attention_to_the_jagers_desc: "Warfare is becoming more and more mobile and we are seeing this play out in the lands of Eastern Europe as the generations go by. Gone are the days of heavy cavalry and heavy infantry clad in chain and plate armor; instead we of Prussia are going to focus on what we can see coming through in the coming ages: light infantry! Jagers, or, hunters/skirmishers, are prime candidates for the role 'light infantry' in the Prussian military, we just need to develop the military doctrine that surrounds them."
 to_modernize_the_prussian_army: "Professional Militarization"
 to_modernize_the_prussian_army_desc: "The powers across Europe, from those that rule over France to those that rule over the Italian Peninsula, and from those that rule over Scandinavia to those that rule over Iberia, all are developing modern military structures. It is a slow and tiresome job for large nations, but Prussia is not like those others that want vast swaths of land across the whole of Europe. As we are content with a smaller portion of land, we can focus solely on modernizing Prussian military standards and the structures that go into forming the military itself, and after we do all of this, there will be none that can stand in our path."

 #Florentine Ideas#

 LAN_ideas_start: "Florentine Traditions"
 LAN_ideas_bonus: "Florentine Ambition"
 a_stake_through_hre_meddling: "Refuse the Holy Roman Empire"
 a_stake_through_hre_meddling_desc: "From the days in 1138 when we threw off the shackles of being a sort of march for the Holy Roman Empire, we established a republic that strived to govern Florence itself and the lands surrounding it. Though much has changed since those founding days of 1138, we still retain memories of the days when medieval soldiers and frontier outposts were common sights in our land. We should not let our militaristic past fade away, no, we need to ensure that part of it stays with us into the future, especially since the Holy Roman Empire is an ever present danger to our great republic."
 bridges_and_churches_of_florence: "Bridges and Churches of Florence"
 bridges_and_churches_of_florence_desc: "During the likes of the 1200s and 1300s, Gothic Architecture reached its peak in Florence. Builders and engineers funded by inhabitants of our great city carved out buildings of great prestige and glory that would last generations, and it is through the functional structures that are beautiful bridges and churches that many still know of us. May the heavens above let legacy last far into the future no matter who comes to this brilliant city of Italian culture."
 strive_to_end_deadly_factionalism: "Resolving Bloody Feuds"
 strive_to_end_deadly_factionalism_desc: "Though we are proud of our republic and how long it has lasted, it is not without its bloody disputes between wealthy families and notable people. Perhaps the greatest known instance of this bloody factionalism is that of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, with the former supporting the Pope and the latter supporting the Holy Roman Emperor. It is a conflict that we must learn from as the blood spilled by it still stains the history of Florence to this day; if something like it breaks out again, the republic may see never the end of it."
 merchants_around_palazzo_della_signoria: "The Palazzo della Signoria"
 merchants_around_palazzo_della_signoria_desc: "The very town hall of Florence, the Palazzo della Signoria, is where much of the administrative work in the city is done as one might expect. But, what one might not expect is the fact that the merchants who come to Florence often make themselves at home and do business just outside the town hall itself via townhouses. This helps make the prosperity of the city that much more tangible to those who in the administration."
 florentine_banking_prospects: "Banking in Florence"
 florentine_banking_prospects_desc: "Siena may seek to regain its status as one of the most pristine places in the Italian Peninsula to do banking in, but the Republic of Florence will never let that happen! The grandiose and prestigious families of Florence know exactly how to keep on top of things economically, especially with the advent of banking being on the minds of several states around us. Even the Medici bank established in 1397 by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici can come into use to keep Florence on top of things!"
 complex_italian_politics: "Complexities of Italian Politics"
 complex_italian_politics_desc: "The politics of Italy are never pretty or simple as people in Florence's administration know all too well. If we are to expand our influence outside of the center of the Italian Peninsula, we are going to need to ensure our military contracts with various mercenaries are up-to-date since both the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire wield considerable power around us."
 stave_off_monarchical_influences: "Glory be to Florence"
 stave_off_monarchical_influences_desc: "To see the Republic of Florence shine through the chaos of war and through the hardships of the Black Death, the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, and the continued efforts of the Holy Roman Empire... It really is a sight to behold, is it not? But the job of maintaining what has been cultivated for so many centuries is never quite done, for the republic can always be improved in some sort of way. Corruption, taxation, foreign influence, and several other matters are going to be what the republic needs to focus on to keep itself independent and strong, but do we have the inner strength to tackle it all? The answer, is yes."

 #Tuscan Ideas#
 propagate_relaxation_on_religion: "Relaxed on Religion"
 propagate_relaxation_on_religion_desc: "Whilst we do sit very close to the Papal States, we cannot deny the fervor that Protestant Reformation has brought to the forefront of theological thought and societal relations. Even some of our most prominent nobles and advisors are either complicit with the Protestant Reformation to a degree, meaning that it would be much better if we were relaxed on this topic as opposed to being zealous about it."
 stability_and_prosperity: "The Stability of Tuscany"
 stability_and_prosperity_desc: "Despite what political upheavals and changes in diplomatic relations there have been over the decades, we have managed to build the state of Tuscany up from prosperous roots. We must not work to guard the traditions and prestige of Tuscany as we go boldly into the future, for there will be several people from beyond our land that will seek to usurp our power and steal what glory we have built up."
 kindly_say_no_to_the_hre: "How Sweet, but no to the HRE"
 kindly_say_no_to_the_hre_desc: "Though we have had a number of relations with members of the Holy Roman Empire, we must kindly decline their continued petitions for influence over Tuscan lands. Despite this decline on our part, we can certainly maintain marital ties and economic treaties with those of Austria, Bavaria, the Swiss Cantons, and plenty of other members. All of this is just a reminder of how adept we must be at diplomacy."
 breaking_surrounding_hegemony: "Breaking Surrounding Hegemony"
 breaking_surrounding_hegemony_desc: "Around us are hegemons of power, no? We see in Iberia that Spaniards and Portuguese claim great power almost without end; there are the French to the northwest who contest lands against the English and also the Germans of the Holy Roman Empire; and to our southeast is the Ottoman Empire, carving out great swaths of land in the Balkans for themselves. Tuscany cannot just sit idly by and focus inward on its own perfection, no, it must be ready to break the hegemony around it and seize the various opportunities for power and success! We must let no power stand in our way of getting where we want to be!"
 tuscan_banking_prospects: "Banking in Tuscany"
 tuscan_banking_prospects_desc: "From the humble days of banking prospects in Siena and Florence to where we are now, few could have imagined that the economy of Tuscany would be so strong. The banking sector is where a lot of this power comes from as our honest and smart bankers have taken it upon themselves to invest money, promote development, and choose wisely as to where they should stake their livelihood. Because of all of this, we can safely say: blessed are we of Tuscany who profit from these ambitions for good, and blessed will our administration be should it ever need to rely on loans from internal lenders."
 formulate_the_accademia_del_cimento: "Form the Accademia del Cimento"
 formulate_the_accademia_del_cimento_desc: "If there is one type of person that our prestige and grandeur has attracted, it is the scholarly type of person! Those who seek insights into the scientific nature of the natural world around us and those who seek to know what answers truly lay in the stars above us at night, they will be gathered across Tuscany into one association or society of sorts so that they can collaborate and work on their studies with proper funding and equipment. What will be the name of this place? It will be called the, 'Accademia del Cimento'."
 navigate_politics_with_care: "Careful Deals; Wise Choices"
 navigate_politics_with_care_desc: "And as we sail into the dense fog of the future with our noble robe tucked tight, our coins stashed safely, and our sword sheathed by our side, there will be none who can say that we are not prepared for what is to come. Ever careful with our own politics and our own diplomatic relations, Tuscany can be said to be one of the most well-spoken and well-meaning states sailing into the future, and when troubles rise up to sink our great state, we will fight back with the utmost care and vigor."

 #Venetian Ideas#
 behold_the_venetian_arsenal: "Glory to the Venetian Arsenal"
 behold_the_venetian_arsenal_desc: "Responsible for the bulk of our naval power, the great amount of shipyards and armories collectively called the 'Venetian Arsenal' is something to marvel at, is it not? No other place around Europe can produce as many ships as our arsenal does which means we have a distinct advantage when it comes to holding sway over affairs in the Mediterranean Sea. In time, the arsenal will also help us project our power outwards as we conquer more valuable islands and inlets of trade."
 forza_ordinaria: "The Forza Ordinaria"
 forza_ordinaria_desc: "In the mainland of Venice, we shall be drafting everyone from the age of 20 to 70 to serve in the military or navy. Now we may not need all of these soldiers and sailors at once of course, but ensuring that this law is enforced and we have people ready to fight for Venice is crucial to sustaining its independence. The only curious thing about this ordinance is that most people seem to want to serve in the navy..."
 the_promissione_ducale: "The Promissione Ducale"
 the_promissione_ducale_desc: "In order to help uphold the republican state of Venice and its possessions, every new leader of Venice will be sworn in via the 'promissione ducale', a special oath taken when elected that outlines the limitations in power they have. Venice will not be a place where monarchy reigns supreme, but instead where delegation of power and the limiting of central authority is seen as the right way to govern."
 no_citizen_is_above_the_laws_of_venice: "Laws of the Venetian Land"
 no_citizen_is_above_the_laws_of_venice_desc: "We cannot be a true republic if some people in our lands are above the law and cannot be punished due to their status of nobility or piety. We must ensure that all, even bishops and priests, are subject to the laws of Venice so that corruption does not creep into our land whilst the court system is unable to do a thing about it. The Papacy may not like how we enforce and apply our laws, but at times we must limit how much the Papacy can influence our communities."
 adriatic_hegemony: "Adriatic Dominance"
 adriatic_hegemony_desc: "Home to Italians one the west and Slavic people to the east, the Adriatic Sea is a valuable place of trade that many seek to hold as their own. The only state that is truly capable of utilizing it to its fullest extent is Venice, as we know, but others that border the Adriatic Sea fail to see our rightful claim to it and even wish to contest us for control over it. We will see just how fruitful these endeavors are as the Stato da Mar expands ever further and the fleet of Venice grows more powerful."
 venetian_glass_luxury: "Venetian Glass"
 venetian_glass_luxury_desc: "The great history of Venetian glass, or, 'vetro veneziano', is well known to all of Europe. The Venetian island of Murano is its traditional home and the glass and glass-like products produced in Murano are some of the most pristine items that are treasured by many. As Venetian power expands further out and control over our domain becomes all the more complete, we should work on keeping the secrets of Venetian glass to ourselves so that our pristine products are always in demand."
 venetian_mercenary_military: "Multinational Mercenary Military"
 venetian_mercenary_military_desc: "The core population of Venetian people has never been that large in comparison to the number of different people groups combined together in the Stato da Mar far off from our mainland. Thus, we have come to rely heavily on mercenaries from across Europe and even mercenaries from North Africa and the Levant. By extending these contracts and working toward integrating mercenaries fully into our military force, we can be sure that they will continually be loyal to us and eventually lower their contract prices."

 #French Ideas#
 contentions_from_the_hundred_years: "The Hundred Years' War"
 contentions_from_the_hundred_years_desc: "Starting in about 1337, some 7 years after the death of Charles IV of France without any sons or brothers as possible heirs, the Hundred Years' War has ravaged many villages, towns, and cities across the French region. The right to rule France is ours alone and those of England will be pushed back time and time again, but we cannot deny just how impactful this long conflict has been on us. Martial experience and deep scars now mark our state and it is stronger because of this."
 convening_of_the_estates_general: "Estates General of France"
 convening_of_the_estates_general_desc: "Having its origins in about 1302, the Estates General is a legislative and consultative assembly of different classes in France. The First Estate is that of the clergy, the Second Estate is that of the nobility, and the Third Estate is that of the commoners, and despite the monarch being nearly all-powerful to outsiders, the Estates General has and can still curtail the powers of the monarch to a fair degree. How the Estates General will function as time goes on though, will be another issue entirely."
 wars_of_religion_in_france: "The Fissures in Catholicism"
 wars_of_religion_in_france_desc: "The Protestant Reformation is having profound effects across Europe and we of France are not immune from this. Scholars, officials, and commoners too are converting to Protestantism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, and even other smaller sects that are more obscure. What is most concerning for us is the fact that the Catholic clergy want to crack down on these new heresies, invoking a great amount of unrest throughout the whole of France that could spell doom for the state itself if the unrest is not dealt with."
 trading_colonies_instead: "Establish Trade Colonies"
 trading_colonies_instead_desc: "Just as the Protestant Reformation burns brightly across Europe, our sailors and explorers tell us of great lands far off to our west that are ripe for settlement. Seeing as we need many of our own soldiers and peasants here in the mainland though, we should set up trading colonies instead so that we use less manpower in them and can more easily find profit within the land itself. Perhaps the natives will even join our efforts if they see more as traders and merchants instead of foreigners who want to take their land."
 the_army_reflects_our_developments: "The Culmination of French Development"
 the_army_reflects_our_developments_desc: "Over the centuries of turmoil and struggle, France has emerged as a stable and strong power in Western Europe that can balance out the others nearby. Whether it is the Holy Roman Empire, Iberian upstarts, English rivals, or even Italian dissidents, we have cultivated a strong and enduring state with a constantly evolving military by its side, ready for anything that may come forth. Traditions may guide us into the future, but the path we tread on is also being built by our own expertise, especially when it comes to warfare."
 defenses_on_our_mainland: "Mainland Defensive Networks"
 defenses_on_our_mainland_desc: "With how warfare is changing to incorporate larger cannons and more accurate muskets into the mix of things, the old defensive fortifications we have are not going to stand up for long in a drawn out war. We must come up with a stronger defensive strategy and build a network of defenses throughout mainland France so that communication between them is easier than before and so that they can withstand artillery fire. If this means we need to rebuild some fortresses from the ground up, then so be it."
 staying_power_of_france: "French Staying Power"
 staying_power_of_france_desc: "A state such as ours is rare for Europe to see, is it not? A state that has lasted for more than 500 years in some form or another and can still be called one of the leading powers in Europe with an administration and military that are perhaps some of the most refined in comparison to other powers in Europe. The enduring traditions of France are something to be truly proud of, and as our military march to defend French interests in both European lands and far off colonies, they go forth knowing they are the apex of the French power. The spirit of France lives on!"

 #Bremen Ideas#
 vorde_castle_at_our_heart: "Residence at Vorde Castle"
 vorde_castle_at_our_heart_desc: "Vorde Castle is the main residence for the Prince-Archbishop of Bremen. The city of Bremen itself may be the seat of the chapter and Basdahl may be our venue for diets of the state, but Vorde Castle remains as a stalwart seat of governance that is well defended and well maintained. Emulating it's defensive construction elsewhere with what funds we have will further our defensive posture and make it harder for our lands to be seized in the future."
 religious_politics_of_archdiocese_bremen: "Religious Politics Never Cease"
 religious_politics_of_archdiocese_bremen_desc: "Whether we are dealing with heretics or people of the true faith, the religious politics of our region are always ensuring that our Prince-Archbishop and those around him are on their feet, ready for what comes next. The politics we have before us can become violent, bloody, and even lead us toward paths we never thought were possible before, but whatever happens inside our archdiocese, it will deepen our devotion to our faith and we will ensure that the outcomes help cement trust from our citizens rather than make them fear that instability is rife in the administration."
 the_gelnhausen_privilege: "The Gelnhausen Privilege"
 the_gelnhausen_privilege_desc: "When we were recognized as a unique political body under the Gelnhausen Privilege in 1186 by Emperor Frederick I, Bremen became less attached to the Papacy in terms of political sway and control. Catholicism is still deeply rooted in Bremen, sure, but the Gelnhausen Privilege issued to Bishop Hartwig II provided us with more centralized political control whilst also being under the close watch of the leader of the Holy Roman Empire."
 push_and_pull_of_estate_power: "Contention in Bremen's Politics"
 push_and_pull_of_estate_power_desc: "The politics of Bremen are complex to say the least, be they religious in nature or not. Various outside dynasties try to have sway in our land, estates try to get their petitions put into law, and the Prince-Archbishop attempts to centralize power underneath themselves in defiance of the estates. This causes a great deal of tension that we know all too well, but it also helps stoke innovation in the minds of several officials and advisors who seek new ways of passing legislation and governing the land properly."
 reputation_as_an_imperial_immediacy: "Imperial Immediacy"
 reputation_as_an_imperial_immediacy_desc: "Being of imperial immediacy is quite beneficial to Bremen as it allows us a number of rights that other duchies and states in the Holy Roman Empire do not have. Though this has meant that Bremen is subject more to the emperor's will as opposed to states that do not hold imperial immediacy, this history behind us gives us quite the reputation around Europe."
 victims_of_outside_supremacy_no_more: "Militarize the Prince-Archbishopric"
 victims_of_outside_supremacy_no_more_desc: "The position of Bremen geographically means it is vulnerable to a variety of threats from many sides, especially if we cannot control the sea during times of war. This needs to change in the future if Bremen is to survive as an independent entity, and to do this we will first need to build up a formal military force beyond that of just forces that can assist the emperor."
 patriarchate_of_the_north_ambition: "Adalbert of Hamburg's Old Ambition"
 patriarchate_of_the_north_ambition_desc: "Back when we were still lumped together under the 'Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen', Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (1000-1072) was perhaps the most influential figure for the time period for us. He had supremacy over the Scandinavian peninsula, lands that were held by the Wends at the time, and also all territory north of the Elbe River. He strived to increase the influence of his archbishopric as much as possible to have it reign as the supreme archdiocese in the far north, though he failed to see this ambition through. Despite our poor luck in the past with politics and military conflicts, we can still strive to see this old ambition through to the end."

 #Hessian Ideas#
 split_apart_and_reunited: "Putting Hesse Back Together"
 split_apart_and_reunited_desc: "Hesse has been divided into Upper Hesse and Lower Hesse several times before because of inheritance laws that we follow. Despite the perils this has caused the House of Hesse, it has given our house members ample training in fabricating and pressing claims on territory some might not traditionally see as Hessian in nature. Refining this skill of fabricating claims will only help Hesse grow over time."
 hesses_place_in_the_reformation: "Our Answer to the Reformation is..."
 hesses_place_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation is spreading rapidly across Central Europe and the Holy Roman Empire is in the very heart of it. Hesse has seen a great many Protestant and Calvinist proponents since the start of this new era of religious strife, yet there are still some in our lands who stand firmly by the side of the Papacy and the Counter-Reformation. Perhaps we should give each side a listen? The Protestants and others seem to have quite a uniquely interesting view on the Bible and traditional Catholic doctrine as it is..."
 marburg_for_theologians: "Found the University of Marburg"
 marburg_for_theologians_desc: "Despite the religious turmoil spread across Europe, Marburg has become a sort of central hub for theologians and scholars of philosophy. Investing into the local infrastructure and setting up a good university fit for fostering religious debate and philosophical thought would do Hesse nicely as it continues to grow and evolve alongside the shifting tides of religion. Perhaps even we can be at the center of innovative ideas in time, or maybe we can help shape some new religious doctrines for ourselves and others."
 leagues_upon_leagues_in_the_hre: "Constant Fighting of Leagues"
 leagues_upon_leagues_in_the_hre_desc: "Leagues of small states to fight for a common cause is not uncommon inside the Holy Roman Empire. It is hard to distinguish a time when there wasn't a public league of some kind that tested the will of the leader of the empire, and we of Hesse have been around to witness quite a few of the historic leagues. In time, we might even join some new leagues and go to war for what we think is righteous and just, and if Hesse gets involved in such affairs, our troops will be motivate firmly to our side of the cause."
 hessian_guns_for_hire: "Providing Contracts and Soldiers"
 hessian_guns_for_hire_desc: "Hesse has not been in the greatest position in the Holy Roman Empire. Taking new land is hard, fighting on our level is ruthless and decisive after just a few months, and we always need to be mindful about what the Holy Roman Emperor might say about our moves. It would be much easier if we just start hiring our soldiers off to other states who are currently fighting so that they stay well trained and fit for service whilst we retain the extra martial capabilities and experiences they bring back."
 moving_of_people_in_central_europe: "Migrations Everywhere"
 moving_of_people_in_central_europe_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has brought about a great many communities being burned to the ground and a great many people moving to new lands in search of religious toleration. Whilst our policy on tolerance is something else, we are more than happy to receive people of the true faith as they can do well in the Hessian military. We can strengthen their fealty toward Hesse in general once they're integrated into Hessian society or the Hessian military, either one will do."
 sharpening_stone_of_religious_war: "Sharpening the Hessian Armory"
 sharpening_stone_of_religious_war_desc: "The decades of warfare in Central Europe that we've come to witness and participate in has helped imbue the military of Hesse with an ongoing martial tradition unlike many others in Europe. Whilst we are not the most seasoned and well-trained military, nor are we the largest one out there in comparison to powers like the Ottoman Empire or France, Hesse can still punch above its weight in a pitched battle and the discipline its troops show is nothing to laugh at. Our forces show the fruits of discipline and martial prowess; of quality of quantity."

 #Mexico Ideas#
 amidst_smoke_and_ashes: "As the Dust Settles..."
 amidst_smoke_and_ashes_desc: "Fighting has been done all across our nation from the start of the revolution to its end with blood, dust, and ashes scattered everywhere. There are so many pieces to pick up as we trudge forward into the future, but our spirit is unwavering and our people are united in their cause. We will rebuild and we will remain as one!"
 mesoamericans_of_mexico: "... Mexico Stands Tall!"
 mesoamericans_of_mexico_desc: "And even as we begin to rebuild, there are those who question about the position of natives like the Aztecs, the Zapotecs, and the Chichimeca, what place do they have in Mexico? Well we have no choice but to integrate them into Mexico itself, accepting their populations into the fold and doing what we can to reconcile differences here and there. Mexico can stand tall in this world beyond Europe, united with its indigenous people against former colonial overlords."
 land_grants_redone: "Reformation of Land Grants"
 land_grants_redone_desc: "The former system of land grants and distributing various plots of land in general is not going to suit Mexico for the future. A staunch overhaul of the entire system is in order so that our economy and administration can function in a more streamlined way, but it will take many years to do this. Thankfully as this goes into effect, it will drive more innovative ways of thinking about how to both distribute land and how to make it productive."
 the_other_rebellion: "The 'Other' Rebellions"
 the_other_rebellion_desc: "Throughout our period of revolution against our former overlords, the indigenous people of the land did stage their own small-scale rebellions aimed at re-establishing independent native polities. These 'other' rebellions gave us valuable experience in a variety of combat conditions meaning that our more elite regiments will know just how to handle such terrain in the future."
 ordinary_people_part_of_the_revolution: "Support from Commoners"
 ordinary_people_part_of_the_revolution_desc: "What many from the outside do not understand about our revolution is why so many peasants and commoners joined in. It did mean that the overall quality of our troops were lower, but the sheer mass of armed soldiers we could put forth was something to truly behold. Our peasant class of people have not forgotten what they fought for and are always willing to take up arms again should they need to dethrone a tyrannical government."
 from_insurgency_to_revolution: "From Insurgency to Revolution"
 from_insurgency_to_revolution_desc: "Another key facet of our revolution was the fact that we had insurgents all across the region. They helped inform regiments about where enemy troops planned to go, how the enemy were going to strike, and even how the enemies were going to be supplied from beyond the coast. Calling upon these insurgents again can ensure the safety of Mexico's independence in the future, and it can also help draw more support for our military if we ever need more than what we currently have."
 what_legacy_does_mexico_have: "Debates on our Future"
 what_legacy_does_mexico_have_desc: "The legacy that we of Mexico hold is shrouded in fog: is it a legacy of imperial conquest? Of upholding republican values? Is there perhaps a third alternative to these two paths? Whatever we find laying beyond the dense fog, we will ensure that Mexico's diverse array of people are represented well so that they can do here what they could not do under the authority of their former overlords in regards to instituting fair and just legislation."

 dumbarton_castle: "Dumbarton Castle"
 dumbarton_castle_desc: "From as far back as our generations can remember, Dumbarton Castle has been the place where fates of lords and clan leaders have been decided since it is in such a pivotal position. With its name meaning roughly 'the fortress of the Britons', it and also being able to support a sizable naval fleet nearby, Dumbarton Castle will forever serve as an example of the fortitude and power of our land."
 the_crux_of_fighting_for_three_sides: "Three Swords at our Throat"
 the_crux_of_fighting_for_three_sides_desc: "These islands to the north that we call home are all claimed by three groups of people besides ourselves: The Scots of the Highlands, the Irish, and the Norse from the far east. Over the centuries we have had claims on our land pressed so that certain individuals may succeed or fail in certain capacities, yet all of these claims just make things all the more clear for us: the history of these fair islands is nothing but old claims and being caught between larger powers. It is time we capitalize on all this bickering and scheming and press what claims we have!"
 clans_of_the_isles: "The Clans of the Isles"
 clans_of_the_isles_desc: "Our land is the origin place of a fair few clans scattered throughout, from Clan MacDougall to Clan Ruaidhri. Whilst we cannot hope to rein in every single member of these clans back to our islands, we can use what connections we have with them to recruit strong and capable fighters for our military. Not only this, but we could also possibly enlist a fair few sailors out of these clans since we are situated in an area where knowing how to sail is vital to survival."
 norse_blood_of_these_islands: "Norse Heritage"
 norse_blood_of_these_islands_desc: "Norse people are not entirely gone from our land but their numbers are slowly declining as a whole. Despite this, our blood is still intertwined with that of Norse folks who sailed to these islands and conquered them for their own benefit centuries ago. Their mighty sailing capabilities and prowess on the high seas is what we should strive to emulate as we continue to build ourselves up."
 refine_the_ounceland_system: "The Ounceland System Redone"
 refine_the_ounceland_system_desc: "The traditional unit of land measurement in our region has been that of the Ounceland. It is based on the rent paid instead of actual land area and has been around for many generations, but we cannot help but start to identify flaws in the system that could be refined if we put enough effort into the matter. Perhaps we could extract more out of our land if we pass new legislation and attempt to come up with a new version of the ounceland system."
 hardened_over_generations: "Consistent Hardship"
 hardened_over_generations_desc: "It is without question that these islands that we call home have been subjected to hardship after hardship over the decades as many wars and conflicts have been fought over who owns what and what clans should be in charge of which islands. We bear the scars of these past conflicts in broad daylight, showing all around us that we will not be put down so easily and that we will endure until the very end."
 fleet_of_the_northern_lands: "The Great Northern Fleet"
 fleet_of_the_northern_lands_desc: "And once we have secured for ourselves a steady independent state that is free from constant threats at our livelihood, a glorious and grand fleet shall grace the waters of the North Sea! That fleet will be built by and for the Kingdom of the Isles, letting all around us know that we can truly challenge any power that threatens us."

 #British Ideas#
 that_this_realm_of_england_is_an_empire: "Proclamation of the Empire"
 that_this_realm_of_england_is_an_empire_desc: "We have come a very long way in regards to our origins. These fair isles are a mix of cultures dating back to the days of Celtic people, Anglo-Saxon settlers, and Norse raiders, but at the end of it all we have come together to organize our people into a formal empire, one that can rule unmatched amounts of land compared to entities from the past."
 listening_to_the_west_country_men: "West Country Men Advice"
 listening_to_the_west_country_men_desc: "A variety of people from the West Country, that of the southwestern portion of mainland England, are looking to endorse and fund our expansionist efforts. Several noted admirals and advisors are willing to serve our interest both out on the high seas and in lands close to home, promoting the identity of Great Britain as a whole and propagating its power in the vast trade routes of Atlantic Ocean. Listening to the advice these people have to offer will only help us more in the future."
 privateer_and_propagate_power: "Extended Influence through All Means"
 privateer_and_propagate_power_desc: "Whether it is through strict colonial organization or ensuring that taxes and tariffs are properly followed and collected, we must ensure that British influence spreads by any and all means. Sometimes it is through shady channels that some would find questionable, other times it is through proud and majestic endeavors, yet every single time we will strive to have our actions increase our reach in the world at large."
 lessons_of_a_new_model_army: "Reformation of Military Principles"
 lessons_of_a_new_model_army_desc: "The days of feudal levies and calling upon loyal nobles for service are declining; we are having to rely more and more on new ways of organizing our own military so that the empire is held together and defended properly. If we can begin to modernize our military and start up a system to professionalize those who choose to serve over time, we'll be able to keep up the pace with regards to military might. The French, Spanish, German princes, and even Italian states are sure to do this as well, meaning we will surely be evenly matched."
 reformation_of_redcoat_regiments: "Redcoats, Stand Firm"
 reformation_of_redcoat_regiments_desc: "The characteristic garb of our soldiers is increasingly becoming the red coats that they wear for service and ceremonies. Not only this, but the ever evolving military doctrines we are putting into place is giving our soldiers in red coats a distinct edge in battle since we have been open to embracing this new era of gunpowder weaponry. Making the red coats a standard in our regiments and ensuring they can flexibly follow instructions with muskets always at the ready will help bolster our overall military capability."
 refitting_the_royal_navy: "A Truly Royal Navy"
 refitting_the_royal_navy_desc: "What is an empire like ours if it doesn't have a proper navy to protect its shores? We are an island nation after all! Royalty like us and our great empire needs a truly royal navy and we will outfit ours with the smartest and most capable sailors we can find, alongside the strongest ship designs we can muster. The many pieces of our domain will be protected no matter what sort of enemy seeks to intrude on our plans."
 the_move_toward_abolitionism: "Enslaving Violates the Rights of Man"
 the_move_toward_abolitionism_desc: "Though we have been engaged in it prior to today, the slave trade is increasingly becoming a tense issue inside our empire. The people of Great Britain, especially the scholars and advisors close to the heart of power, are raising questions as to how morally right it is to be enslaving people despite them being of a different skin color and of a different language. They are human too, are they not? They deserve rights like any other man, do they not? This notion of abolitionism isn't going to stop anytime soon in our empire, so perhaps it is time we fully look into the matter and make a just and righteous judgement."

 maritime_republic_prominence_desc: "Our splendid republic is known by many names to many people and our prominence is far beyond that of many Italian cities. Our rivals in Venice know of our glory as well and they have coveted it for decades just like we covet their glory, yet our time in the sun is far from over. Genoa must keep pressing forward with its dutiful and grand navy guiding the way; we, the 'la Dominant dei mari' (the Dominant of the Seas), 'la Superba' (the Superb one), and the 'la Repubblica dei magnifici' (the Republic of the Magnificents), will be the one that encompasses all of the Mediterranean!"
 old_byzantine_trade_ties: "Byzantine Connections"
 old_byzantine_trade_ties_desc: "Old connections from when the Byzantine Empire was still a grand power in the east are around, even though Turkish traders and merchants have taken the place of Byzantine ones. Genoa's influence in the Aegean Sea remains there even after all this time has passed, though it is on the cusp of falling into disarray if we cannot maintain a good fleet nor good income. If we can manage to cement our hold over Lesbos, Azov, and our other territories in the east, then we can capitalize off of what old Byzantine trade ties we have still."
 providing_credit_to_others: "Credit where Credit is Needed"
 providing_credit_to_others_desc: "As politics continue to rumble around in the Holy Roman Empire to our north, various princes, bishops, and sometimes even emperors need sources of credit and funds for their campaigns both in the political and military realm. We of Genoa are all too eager to offer credit in these circumstances since we can profit off of these deals later, we just have to remember to learn from when these credit deals turn sour so that we can improve our methods of financing."

 genoese_banking_desc: "Perhaps one of the oldest banks in the world is found within Genoa, that which is called the Bank of Saint George. Founded in 1407 and still running now, it is a testament to our will to continue our banking prospects even as other states around us invest into banking as a whole. What makes us stand out in the respect is just how efficient our methods of banking are and how much fortune our noble families have amassed. These two aspects in tandem with each other gives Genoese banks the fuel they need to assess and evaluate economic matters in manner unmatched by anyone else, and it will help Genoa become one of the banking centers in Europe."
 indirect_genoese_governance: "Indirect Authority"
 indirect_genoese_governance_desc: "The nature of the Genoese state means that it does not have the power to govern its lands to the east and beyond Corsica in a direct manner. We have relied heavily on indirect governance methods for a long while and it has worked for us so far, but we are soon going to feel the strain that is keeping up with maintaining these far off lands underneath our decentralized way of governing. On the plus side, it does mean that Genoa can rule over more land as a whole as compared to other states around us."
 venetian_conflicts: "The Eternal Sea Rivalry"
 venetian_conflicts_desc: "Venice is undoubtedly our largest rival. Whether it is at foreign markets or along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the ships and merchants from Venice plague the power that stems from Genoa without end. We must not lose hope though, for we know that we can beat Venice eventually if we calculate our moves out and ally the right states against Venice. Our fleets will fit for any major clash at sea as well since we are actively learning from our defeats before and improving upon our naval tactics as the years go by."
 the_genoese_arsenal: "An Arsenal for Genoa"
 the_genoese_arsenal_desc: "The Venetian Arsenal is something we do not like to be jealous of, but we cannot help ourselves in this manner. It is famous for its ability to produce ships at an amazing rate, serving to prop up the Venetian fleet time and time again. Though we cannot have the arsenal directly, perhaps we can start building our own arsenal for Genoa and concentrate funds toward obtaining engineers and builders who know exactly what they are doing with regards to building ships for trade and war. If we eclipse Venice in the future, we might even be able to dismantle their arsenal and make ours the only one in all of Europe."

 #American Ideas#
 delegation_of_powers: "Delegate Central Authority"
 delegation_of_powers_desc: "Our former overlords were far too fond of central authority and placing it in the hands of either one person or just a few highly valued people. We must delegate some of these powers once entrusted to monarchs and advisors of said monarchs to specific branches of government. Once we have formulated said branches of government, we will be able to more effectively scrutinize incoming legislation and refine it before it is put into law."
 liberal_republican_outlook: "Above the Ideas of Monarchy"
 liberal_republican_outlook_desc: "In many ways we find the ideas of old monarchies to be archaic and ill-suited for the people of the United States of America. We can clearly see the ideas of this age and what they espouse as being rational in a variety of ways, and when compared to old traditions that our former overlords clung to, these liberal and republican ideas are better in almost every way at representing the people of this land fairly and justly."
 managing_imports_and_exports: "Balance Imports vs. Exports"
 managing_imports_and_exports_desc: "The coast of our up-and-coming state is vast, open to invasion and also open to a variety of trade routes. We would do well to take control of coastal areas through settlements and enforce more authority over both imports and exports so that we can reduce the chance of smugglers getting through whilst also helping encourage domestic trade between states along the coast. There are goods in the north that just aren't found in the south and vice versa."
 poential_states_for_statehood: "Accepting New States"
 poential_states_for_statehood_desc: "New land we acquire through settling new towns and villages on the frontier can quickly balloon in population size. Fertile and open land are especially popular with American families and thus, we are going to get fairly rapid settlements as the years go by. Now, we can give land grants fairly easily but we processing applications for statehood takes months to go through, meaning we need to formalize the process over the coming decades and ensure that states can have solid borders and a firm place in our nation."
 overarching_unifying_identity: "Unity Amongst the Varied States"
 overarching_unifying_identity_desc: "Our nation is not a nation of one single people. We have folks from all different walks of life that is true, but it is also true that we have folks from various cultural backgrounds and they can contribute to tensions inside these United States if we let them go unheard. We should instead strive to listen to what they have to say, and strive to give them representation in our government so that they feel and know their voices are heard."
 militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army: "Transitions of the Military"
 militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army_desc: "The military we used to get where we are was hardly a formal military force in comparison to our former overlords. From the days of being town-oriented militias to being something of a true standing army for these United States of America, we are well on our way to organizing a robust military that can protect the liberties we fought for."
 move_toward_freedom_of_religion: "Let Other Faiths Speak Freely"
 move_toward_freedom_of_religion_desc: "Religion is a tense subject inside our borders but we have a strong inclination toward being indifferent to religion as a whole. Many vouch for freedom of religion in our land, but there are strong religious communities and strongly religious officials in our government who refuse to let go of having a state-enforced religion. In this context we must work ever so slowly toward separating our politics from our personal religion; this is a land of liberty and freedom, not of religious conformity."

 #Welsh Ideas#
 rhodri_and_the_black_gentiles: "Rhodri and the Black Gentiles"
 rhodri_and_the_black_gentiles_desc: "Rhodri ap Merfyn was 'King of the Britons' according to the Annals of Ulster and through our own records, Rhodri attained a great deal of success for Gwynedd. He annexed Powys and Seisyllwg whilst also holding off invasions from vikings (called 'Black Gentiles' in our old sources), all of which gave a solid foundation for the coming Kingdom of Gwynedd. His military deeds and willingness to defend the Welsh people and their lands from invasions will forever be remembered, and he will be known as one of the greatest rulers in all of Welsh history."
 chronicle_of_the_princes_and_more: "Brut y Tywysogion"
 chronicle_of_the_princes_and_more_desc: "Brut y Tywysogion, or, the Chronicle of the Princes, is one of the finest and greatest sources of Welsh history that we have with us. It details the deaths of certain important figures, when eclipses happened, when plagues struck, and even events relating to religion in Welsh lands. Though some of our literary tradition has faded since the English annexed our land, we can still bring back the grandeur of Welsh literature and oral tradition for the future; we no longer have the English yoke over us and thus no longer have to abide by their demeaning laws."
 commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth: "Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth"
 commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth_desc: "The three principle places of Wales that held historical prominence to us of today are Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth. There were a great number of succession disputes and battles that took place in the lands of all three, yet Welsh people from all three lands came together time and time again to revolt against encroaching English authority in centuries past. We need to focus on this unifying identity of Wales and break down small community barriers so that we can be stronger and more robust internally, since exploiting internal Welsh feuds has historically been what the English did."
 eliminate_succession_questions: "Affirm Reformed Succession Laws"
 eliminate_succession_questions_desc: "The succession to power in Welsh lands has always been a tricky thing. Family members feel jealous that they did not get a cut of power or they are acting upon false information that ends up causing untold amounts of damage, all of this ends up hurting Wales internally and making it vulnerable to external influences. By refining our succession laws and ensuring that our heir is affirmed by multiple family members and court members, Wales can finally solve its internal disputes and do away with petty claims to the throne."
 celtic_christianitys_legacy: "Celtic Christianity"
 celtic_christianitys_legacy_desc: "The influences of Christianity in Wales are plain for all to see, but so are the influences from how Wales was before Christianity arrived. This sort of Celtic Christianity that developed in Wales and in other places nearby held slightly different views and laws that were not in line with laws set out by the Papacy, meaning that Celtic Christianity was in a sense more open to different views. At the same time, Celtic Christianity was shaped by Welsh people and being very community oriented made for a distinct form of Christianity that could identify foreigners to the subset faith fairly easily."
 regularize_welsh_yeoman: "Regularize the Yeomanry"
 regularize_welsh_yeoman_desc: "Yeoman have been in usage in England for quite some time and Welsh people have historically held the title of 'yeoman' in a variety of places throughout England, but what set Welsh folks apart from English yeoman was the increased usage of the longbow. Though the longbow is being phased out of usage, the Welsh yeoman population are still capable of military combat and should be formalized as time goes on. Giving them proper training and transitioning them to proper gunpowder weaponry with enough discipline will make the Welsh yeomanry a truly grand force."
 economic_independence_of_wales: "Economic Independence"
 economic_independence_of_wales_desc: "Another avenue of exploitation that the English used against us was in the way of the Welsh economy. We produce quite a few things like cattle, timber, horses, wax, cheese, and flannel, but we have historically impomrtated salt, wine, and wheat from places like London and Paris. Thus, the English could easily exploit us when they needed to, but now we are in a position to fight back! We have the measures to obtain true economic independence from the English and in time, we can even outclass them in the production of certain materials and resources. All of this relies on our efforts from here on out."

 ger_unification_of_german_people: "Unity Amongst German People"
 ger_unification_of_german_people_desc: "For too many ages, eras, and centuries the German people have been split apart into various tribes, princedoms, republican states, and also theocratic states. This time of uniting the German people into a singular state with new traditions and ideas at our disposal will prove to be a pivotal time for us. Through our actions here in this coming era of German unification, others around us will know the true power that lies within a German state that has broken down the petty barriers between the various groups such as Saxons, Bavarians, Swabians, and every other Germanic people."
 ger_authentic_military_traditions: "Culmination of Militaristic Traditions"
 ger_authentic_military_traditions_desc: "From the age of battling against the Roman Empire to the age of founding the Holy Roman Empire to the age of gunpowder weaponry making its way into European military strategy, the various people of Germany have been well versed in military matters regardless of where they are located. The German state we have cultivated can and will be the ultimate culmination of this extensive military tradition, and we will perfect the usage of gunpowder weapons both large and small in the field of battle."
 ger_iron_and_coal: "Industrial Might Rising"
 ger_iron_and_coal_desc: "The various lands we control in Central Europe are fertile with veins of coal and iron, but until recently both resources have been relatively hard to utilize on an industrial scale; mining, extracting, and refining these raw resources into more usable material just takes resources that previous German states could not muster up on their own. In our current state though, we have the financial power and the administrative power to start strong coal and iron industries throughout Germany. It will be through these industries that we will bring Germany into the industrial age! And it will be an age that we will come to call our own!"

 hab_concentrated_german_banking: "Concentrated German Banking"
 hab_concentrated_german_banking_desc: "Our foundations in German banking has never been in doubt. The Fuggers and Welsers have funded a great many projects in our land whilst bringing prosperity to the various German cities all throughout Central Europe. Not only this though, but the German banking families have helped us in regards to getting certain royal family members into key positions of power which goes to show just how influential and smart they can be. The more we can rely on them as opposed to foreign bankers, the better off we will be."
 hab_court_of_the_habsburgs: "The Grandeur of our Court"
 hab_court_of_the_habsburgs_desc: "The roots of our state are colored by the fact that diplomacy and marriages were just as key to our rise to power as military endeavors were, perhaps more so than other states around us. Thus, we rightfully take pride in the fact that our royal family is both desirable and influential in lands well beyond our current borders. The more we spread out and influence other nations through bonds of blood, the better off we will be."
 hab_holder_of_imperial_authority: "Imperial Splendor"
 hab_holder_of_imperial_authority_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire was an... Interesting experiment, let us say that much for now. Leading the Holy Roman Empire is something few are capable of doing, but the Austrian people proved to be the ones who were most capable of securing the position as emperor and sustaining it throughout time. It is these Austrian roots of ours and the reputation we have of keeping the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in our realm that helps give us diplomatic prominence."
 hab_routine_frontier_contacts: "Encounters at our Borders"
 hab_routine_frontier_contacts_desc: "It is never easy at the borders of a united German state like ours, yet our military is more versed in this matter than others would think. Austrians have traditionally been at the fringes of Germanic culture in the southeast, bordering the Magyars to the east, the Italians to the south, and the Balkan states in the southeast. So what does this long frontier do for our military personnel? It trains them over time and allows us to enforce more strict borders that are in our favor."

 frc_reversing_the_kleinstaaterei: "Reversal of the Fragmentation"
 frc_reversing_the_kleinstaaterei_desc: "In the centuries of the past, the Holy Roman Empire was the site of and the vehicle in which several once prominent Stem Duchies declined and fragmented into feuding princes and warring states. Now that the Franconian people have transcended these antiquated lines in the sand that were once drawn by petty dukes and bishops, we can promote a policy of harmonious assimilation of people we take into this new German state we have crafted. Taking in these fragmented states into our fold has been quite the task as it is, why should this history of ours not help shape our policy of expansion?"
 frc_strategic_usage_of_robber_barons: "Strategies with Robber Barons"
 frc_strategic_usage_of_robber_barons_desc: "People such as the infamous Eppelein von Gailingen of Middle Franconia are known as robber barons. They have plagued certain parts of the Holy Roman Empire in the past and even in our up-and-coming German state they are not unheard of since chivalrous knights of old who no longer have traditional work turn to the work of being robber barons. We have our work cut out for us to keep the ones inside our state at bay, but perhaps we can make deals with robber barons in neighboring areas just outside of German lands where lucrative trade routes cross into rural and unprotected land held by our rivals. It may be an underhanded tactic, but one that can easily net Germany a hefty amount of trade income."
 frc_centralized_franconian_circle_power: "Evolution of the Franconian Circle"
 frc_centralized_franconian_circle_power_desc: "The Franconian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire is no longer around in an official sense, but it helped cement the foundation for our rise to power and also helped solidify the resolve of many Franconian officials in the past. It is thanks to the foundations of the Franconian Circle that we have the military strength that we do, and also the capability of expanding our land forces through the development of regimental towns and organization."
 frc_come_to_terms_with_commoners: "German People of All Classes"
 frc_come_to_terms_with_commoners_desc: "The ages of time have not been the kindest to Franconian people nor the large states that German people have tried to cultivate in the past. Despite the odds against us though, we have managed to overcome the barriers in regards to state unification for the German people meaning that we can address issues in regards to the various social classes in a much more direct way. Whether they are issues concerning nobles of great status, merchants of various guilds, clergy of the various Christian denominations, or even commoners who work the vital farmlands of Germany, we will hear them all and reduce the desire to stir unrest throughout all of Germany."

 sax_reclaimed_glory_of_saxony: "Lost Glory, Found"
 sax_reclaimed_glory_of_saxony_desc: "Not since the Stem Duchy of Saxony and the early days of the Electorate of Saxony did the Saxon people have so much prestige amongst other German speaking people. Finally after so many conflicts and deals have the Saxon people been able to do what so many have strived for: unification of the Germans throughout all of Central Europe. Such a momentous occasion is symbolic to many and is seen as almost succeeding where the Stem Duchy of Saxony left off so long ago."
 sax_upper_and_lower_saxons: "Strength of the Saxon People"
 sax_upper_and_lower_saxons_desc: "Saxon people have played a crucial role in a myriad of politics concerning German states in the past and that is going to be no different as we go forward. Holding the strongest amount of power in Germany as of now and bringing a grandiose age of unity to these fair lands, it should be no surprise that Saxons from all walks of life are willing to defend what we have cultivated so far, much more so than Austrians, Bavarians, or even Franconians."
 sax_perfection_of_architecture: "Perfecting Architecture"
 sax_perfection_of_architecture_desc: "Many styles of architecture are around in Germany, but it is in the northern parts where Saxon people make themselves at home alongside Pomeranians and Westphalians that we see architecture reaching its absolute apex. Whether it is in the work of great cathedrals or in the intricate details of the sprawling castles of our land, we are always striving to perfect our architecture as time goes on. As we do so, we'll be able to attract bright minds from all across Europe and also refine just how exactly we build these structures."
 sax_strive_for_innovative_thought: "Innovation in German Minds"
 sax_strive_for_innovative_thought_desc: "Saxon land in the north has been seen by many as the heart of the Protestant Reformation and indeed it is this region that has bred many innovative minds with regards to philosophers and theologians. Cultivating this mindset and being open to new ideas instead of closing our doors to them should be what Germany strives for since such new concepts and bold claims could lead to radical discoveries that change the way we think about key matters."

 bav_quality_over_quantity: "German Quality"
 bav_quality_over_quantity_desc: "We Germans have usually sided with the quality side of things instead of the quantity side when it comes to a variety of matters, but this is no more clear than in our military structure. We focus on the discipline and merit of individual regiments and officers so as to ensure the staying power of our forces on the field of battle whilst also projecting the influence of Germany in the various conflicts we are involved in."
 bav_let_the_music_flow: "Let the Music Flow!"
 bav_let_the_music_flow_desc: "The Renaissance brought with it a plethora of wonderful innovations in the fields of philosophy, theology, natural science, and even music making. The subject of music making has been especially present in our core lands of Bavaria for some time and it is because of the foundation set up by the Renaissance that various Bavarian orchestras and composers have become famous all across Europe. Cultivating this musical tradition will grant us not only a lasting legacy far into the future, but it will also attract a great number of famous scholars and officials to our land."
 bav_stringent_production_regulations: "Regulations on Production"
 bav_stringent_production_regulations_desc: "Whether it is producing beer or producing gunpowder, we are keen on regulating the production methods in Germany due to the fact that we have witnessed what can happen when markets without regulation spiral out of control. Economic hardships as a result of unregulated markets is what we will avoid at all costs and the heartland of Bavaria in Germany will be the shining example of what an economy with firm and clear regulations can do."
 bav_reformation_of_holy_order_ranks: "Transition the Holy Orders"
 bav_reformation_of_holy_order_ranks_desc: "Age-old orders dedicated to the Catholic faith are finding themselves without purpose and without work as time goes on. Germany houses a fair few sectors of holy orders but increasingly they are becoming restless due to the age of religious wars being well and truly over. Perhaps we can set up a sort of administrative sector that can help transition these warriors of the faith toward a regular military career, for if we are able to do so, we will have the stalwart backing of courageous fighters that come from hallowed ancestry."

 pom_our_northern_ports: "Great Northern Ports"
 pom_our_northern_ports_desc: "Places in the north like Oldenburg, Hamburg, Lubeck, Rugen, and Stettin are where the majority of German sailors and traders come from as the maritime tradition of the north has had a strong influence on both politics and diplomacy. Emphasizing these northern ports and building up our naval prominence will help encourage merchants to come to our safe coastal cities and build them up to being economic centers."
 pom_focus_on_northern_trade: "Focus on Northern Trade"
 pom_focus_on_northern_trade_desc: "Historically the German people have rarely had homes in the south that bordered any sort of coast, thus not allowing us access to Mediterranean trade overall. The north, though, especially in the Baltic Sea, is where German people have been able to contest the likes of Scandinavians and Russians, so why would we not focus our mercantile matters here? Sharpening our metaphorical mercantile blade against our cultural neighbors will only breed German dominance in the markets of Europe."
 pom_defense_against_scandinavians: "Scandinavian Incursions"
 pom_defense_against_scandinavians_desc: "The greatest foreign rival to northern merchants and small German states like Wolgast, Rugen, and Mecklenburg has been the Scandinavian people. Denmark and Sweden in particular have skirmished with Pomeranian traders frequently over the centuries, meaning that Pomeranians are especially versed in how to deal with Scandinavian fleets. Perhaps if we eclipse our northern rivals in terms of naval strength, we can bring about a more efficient trade sector stemming from the Baltic Sea."
 pom_unparalleled_mercantile_dominance: "Silver, Gold, and Fiscal Responsibility"
 pom_unparalleled_mercantile_dominance_desc: "The combination of German banking with German mercantile methods is something that make European markets and trade centers the economic envy of the entire world. It will be a long road to get to this point since German banking is actively developing and the merchants of our land need to be worked with over time, but if we are consistent in this regard and set up the German economy to be oriented toward harnessing the power of cross-continental trade, Germany will be an unstoppable economic power."

 rhn_to_cross_the_rhine_river: "The Rhine River Crossings"
 rhn_to_cross_the_rhine_river_desc: "The mighty Rhine River is the river by which many communities make their living, and it is also the river where several battles in history have been decided. Germans and French people know the significance of this grand river all too well, and since it is in our control, we can practice crossing it routinely with our soldiers so that they know exactly what to do should they face a battle that involves any sort of river crossing."
 rhn_electorates_and_free_cities: "Legacy of Imperial States"
 rhn_electorates_and_free_cities_desc: "From electorates to free cities, the Rhenish people have held several grandiose positions of power in the Holy Roman Empire and have attained a reputation that is hard to surpass. With this in mind and also the fact that diplomacy was key to maintaining the semblance of power in Rhenish lands, we will be able to cultivate a German state that is capable in its diplomacy and in remembering its heritage."
 rhn_the_dreaded_french: "The Dreaded French"
 rhn_the_dreaded_french_desc: "If there has been one issue Germans have always faced since the inception of the Holy Roman Empire, it is the dreaded French. Whether through shrewd politics to adept diplomacy to firm military campaigns, the French have invaded eastward against German people for ages now and we have pushed back just as hard as they pushed against us. And who have always been at the front of these French invasions? The Rhenish people, that is who! Through the experiences the Rhenish people have gone through, we will be ready for whatever the French try to throw at us next!"
 rhn_economic_liberalization: "Liberal Economic Measures"
 rhn_economic_liberalization_desc: "The Rhine River is bountiful in what it gives to German people in terms of prosperity and opportunity. As we begin to cultivate a more financially adept and innovative state, Germany should look to the Rhineland to see how proper urban development should go. From these pivotal cities on the rise, we can make other cities in Germany just as grand in their infrastructure."

 swb_nucleus_of_many_leagues: "Swabian Political Formations"
 swb_nucleus_of_many_leagues_desc: "Several times in the past, Swabians have joined together to form decentralized yet connected leagues and political formations to stand up for what is just in the eyes of Swabians. This history of Swabians attempting to unite together for common political causes is what can help unite other Germans for over-arching political causes, especially in times of war since any threat to our borders is a threat to Germany as a whole. Swabians may be the nucleus of Germany today, but we must bring all Germans together to the common defense of the state."
 swb_numerous_swabian_settlements: "Numerous Swabian Settlements"
 swb_numerous_swabian_settlements_desc: "Swabian people have settled in their respective part of Germany, true, but there are several Swabian settlements in various other parts of Europe. Drawing upon these various Swabian settlements for extended regiments and to help defend parts of Germany is exactly what we should do in the future, and as we recruit from these numerous Swabian settlements they will stand as a patriotic example to other German people groups like Austrians, Rhenish, and Franconians."
 swb_where_opportunity_is_we_are: "Where is the Opportunity?"
 swb_where_opportunity_is_we_are_desc: "Opportunity is abound for Germans all across Europe, but this is also especially true in various parts of Germany. Now that we have broken down the cultural barriers between many of the German speaking people groups, we can extend the opportunities open to Swabians, Austrians, Rhenish, Franconians, and all other German speaking people and concentrate on bolstering our internal economy as well as our centralized administration."
 swb_swabian_financial_centers: "German Economics"
 swb_swabian_financial_centers_desc: "It is not enough that we have strong economic interests and are bold in our economic aspirations, no, we must strive to have true economic centers where banking and finances are taken care of in earnest. Employing the growing class burghers in Germany in respectable financial positions as well as educating our populace on innovative economic theories will help keep Germany on top of Europe's financial matters."

 wst_in_so_many_states: "Epicenter of Vast Power"
 wst_in_so_many_states_desc: "For centuries upon centuries, Germany and its various large cities have been the home of vast amounts of power. They gave their power to a number of states such as East Francia, the Stem Duchies that followed East Francia's fracturing, and of course the Holy Roman Empire, but most of all they can now give their power to a fully united German state. Perhaps the most prosperous cities of all are the Westphalian cities, but even the other cities throughout Germany can contribute to the administration in more ways than one."
 wst_religious_conflict_ends: "End of the Religious Line"
 wst_religious_conflict_ends_desc: "For far too long we've seen religion divide up German states into petty families and communities that spill blood over the slightest of theological differences. What good is this going to do the Westphalian people alongside every other German people group? We must work a neutral ground of sorts, one where we can work religious disputes in the proper theological circles whilst keeping politics separate entirely. It won't be an easy process for Germany, but with enough manpower and official support, we might just be able to rid ourselves of this religious strife."
 wst_attraction_of_cultured_folks: "Cultured German Society"
 wst_attraction_of_cultured_folks_desc: "We may not be as illustrious as the Italian Peninsula in what innovations we come up with, but we certainly have enough bright minds to uphold Germany as a pillar of technological prowess. By focusing our administration toward what Westphalian people have always been geared towad, that being the future and consistent modernization, we will be able to propel Germany to even greater heights."
 wst_route_to_modernization: "A Mind for Modernity"
 wst_route_to_modernization_desc: "Without having a mindset aimed at modernity and what it entails, the rest of the body will be anchored and stuck in the past. This is a fate Germany must never suffer as it is certainly sentencing our state to death by foreign powers encroaching in on a withering corpse. Gearing ourselves toward education and literacy whilst also focusing on building up a meritocratic administration will mean that Germany has what it takes to challenge others across Europe whilst keeping its own politics in check."

 low_look_to_the_globe: "The Global German"
 low_look_to_the_globe_desc: "The Age of Exploration has yielded unprecedented amounts of wealth for those of Western Europe, but us Germans have been left in the dust for far too long! Now that a truly unified German state is at hand without the barriers of the old Holy Roman Empire holding back the German people, we can utilize our great docks in the lands of the Flemish and Frisians to utilize charter companies all across the globe. Truly we do have the capability of being a global German state, we only need the will and strength to do so."
 low_on_land_and_on_the_water: "By Land, and by Sea!"
 low_on_land_and_on_the_water_desc: "As we extend our reach all across the globe, we must have our training camps and shipyards ready for any and every campaign we engage in. Through building up frontier outposts that can become training grounds, and through finding natural harbors that can foster strong settlements of our own people, we will exercise our authority all across the land we see and conquer."
 low_credit_to_germans: "The Spread of Banks"
 low_credit_to_germans_desc: "Banking is such a prominent part of economies now-a-days that it is a marvel that some economies function without the institution. German banking, especially the banking sectors in Flemish and Frisian lands, is of the highest quality in all of Europe and perhaps even the world, thus giving us a distinct advantage in the world of economics. Not only this, but emphasizing the banking sector of these lands in Germany will steer mercantile matters toward them."
 low_a_diamond_in_our_eye: "Unmatched Prominence"
 low_a_diamond_in_our_eye_desc: "To have a mind for diplomacy and trade is one thing, but to cultivate an economy that can reliably depend on both is another. We are doing just such a thing for Germany as a whole, and should our fellow states near and far fail in their economic aspirations or diplomatic endeavors, they can always turn to Germany for assistance in one way or another. So long as these situations help expand our influence elsewhere, we are always willing to help out."

 swi_canton_formalization: "Evolve the Swiss Structure"
 swi_canton_formalization_desc: "Swiss Cantons were always a spectacle to other states in the Holy Roman Empire and those on the outside. None could really emulate our structure of governance and yet, it has given up ample time to know what its strengths and weaknesses are so that we can fix where it falls short and double up on where it excels. In particular this government structure helps instill a strong sense of connected identity that refuses to be broken by even by the strongest of invaders, meaning that when called upon to right cause for all of Germany, we can bring together all German communities and exert unprecedented amounts of force."
 swi_memories_of_mercenaries: "Mercenary Memories"
 swi_memories_of_mercenaries_desc: "The age of mercenary troops dominating the fields of Europe is at an end and professional standing armies are becoming more common because of how technology and societies have changed. German society is moving right along with this change, but we are still affected greatly by how influential the mercenaries of our past were. Perhaps if we are able to obtain new contracts in the future for professional foreign armies or vice versa, we can engage in mutually beneficial relations with foreigners on a military level."
 swi_defensive_fighting: "Discipline in Defensive Fights"
 swi_defensive_fighting_desc: "Defensive warfare is not the ideal type of warfare for many states since it implies they are on the losing end usually, but Swiss people have been teaching other German people groups that defensive fighting is exactly what can chip away at enemy morale and manpower reserves. Bolstering our fortifications and having concrete exit retreat areas and strategies is what can help German people sustain fewer casualties whilst also keeping the enemy at bay."
 swi_swiss_lessons_on_unity: "To Unite is to Learn"
 swi_swiss_lessons_on_unity_desc: "The chronicles of the past for various German people groups are vast, but for the Swiss it is certiainly more focused on attempts at unification alongside what tests the will of people who dare to try and unite the various petty states into one mass. Others in Germany could stand to learn about this in earnest and helping teach the benefits of unification will bolster their confidence in our state over the coming decades. Swiss stories do seem to be timeless tales, do they not?"

 #Mughal Ideas#
 mansabdars_and_sowars: "Mansabdars and Sowars"
 mansabdars_and_sowars_desc: "Within our administrative structure, we need to form new positions of importance in the ranks of our military. The notion of mansabdars has been floated around by many in our administration, but it is only recently that many are waking up to the fact that such a system would do us very well. These mansabdars, who are traditionally in charge of military matters, high civil offices, and provincial governance, will serve the Mughal Empire well into the future and the system of ranks including that of the 'zat' and 'sowar' can be adjusted as time goes on."
 no_tribute_but_instead_new_agriculture: "A Closer Look at Agriculture"
 no_tribute_but_instead_new_agriculture_desc: "When we came upon the subcontinent, we found a distinctly old fashioned system of agriculture in place throughout the various areas past the Khyber Pass. We will be the bringers of a new age of agriculture to this subcontinent and do away with these ineffective old methods of collecting taxes and tribute through agriculture. It will take many months of hard work but instituting these agrarian reforms and placing an emphasis on meritocratic civil administration will help bolster production output and make it easier to develop rural lands all across our empire."
 the_ibadat_khana: "A True House of Worship"
 the_ibadat_khana_desc: "For a great many centuries, Muslims have ruled lands in Hindustan as minorities amongst Hindu populations. The various Muslim leaders and officials were right to not force conversions upon the Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists they came across, but they did nothing more beyond simply tolerating those outside of Islam in this diverse land. We will build upon this foundation of tolerance and build what is the first in the long line of such functional structures: a House of Worship, or, an Ibadat Khana. No matter their faith, let Muslims converse with Hindus, let Buddhists converse with Christians; all can be welcome into these theological and philosophical places of discussion."
 architecture_fit_for_our_empire: "The Pinnacle of Architecture"
 architecture_fit_for_our_empire_desc: "Coming across these vast lands of Hindustan with so many cultures and traditions that can be traced back thousands of years, it would certainly seem that we have our work cut out for us in terms of making an impact through new buildings like mosques, temples, forts, and palaces. Yet, we are ambitious enough to pursue these architectural goals as we have an influx of Persian influences from the west that are actively being combined with native Hindustani styles. This Indo-Islamic architecture that we are cultivating will be what future generations look upon in awe, and they will enhance our prestige to any foreigner that travels to our land."
 zamindars_and_marzabans: "Zamindars and Marzabans"
 zamindars_and_marzabans_desc: "Local rulers who are more used to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist populations than we are lay scattered around our empire, paying lip service to our administration whilst skirting around some regulations we have in place. This cannot stand if we are to continue to expand both internally and externally, which is exactly where the system of zamindars and marzabans comes into play. These zamindars and marzabans will be formalized as time goes on and will be given land grants and the right to collect taxes from their own local populations, but they will also be required to hold down the land with forces from the very population they rule over in accordance with mansabdari forces."
 transition_out_of_wars_for_the_throne: "Peace of the Mughal Throne"
 transition_out_of_wars_for_the_throne_desc: "For far too long we have suffered under the weight of pretenders rising up and trying to take the throne when the old ruler is close to death. Sons and cousins waging civil war to take the throne for themselves only causes needless suffering and stresses the administration of the Mughal Empire even further than what it already goes through. Thus, it is clear that we must reform the system of succession to our throne and give the sons, daughters, and even nieces and nephews of the current ruler a proper job throughout the administration or military."
 proto_industrialization_of_the_subcontinent: "Proto-Industrialization!"
 proto_industrialization_of_the_subcontinent_desc: "The years go by in our empire and throughout its growth, we are seeing villages turn into towns and towns growing into cities. Urban populations are growing like never before, new production techniques are being utilized by textile weavers, and industries such as shipbuilding and metalware and agriculture are growing at unprecedented paces. Whilst our administration might struggle to keep up with how high our internally development is growing, we will be sure to profit greatly from this rising tide of industrial output. We will have little need of outside imports if we can truly harness the power we have here in Hindustan."

 #Russian Ideas#
 independence_from_the_patriarch_down_south: "An Independent Russian Church"
 independence_from_the_patriarch_down_south_desc: "For decades now, our status as dependent on the Eastern Orthodox Church in the south at Constantinople has been loosening. The rising power of the Russian people is something that should push this forward so that we can secure ourselves as independent in all church functions, legitimizing our administration in more ways than one over time. Our reliance on outsiders is no more; Russia's rise is now at hand."
 the_siberian_frontier: "The Siberian Frontier Awaits!"
 the_siberian_frontier_desc: "Whilst we struggle with our efforts against the Polish, Lithuanians, Swedish, and Turkish enemies in our west, the east is rather empty beyond the likes of steppe nomads that seem to be on the brink of collapse half of the time. These vast lands of Siberia would be far more useful if we were to annex them into Russia, slowly developing them over time and extracting what resources they have so that the more prosperous parts of Russia (like Moscow, Novgorod, and Tver) can grow even more."
 taming_of_the_steppe: "Taming of the Steppe"
 taming_of_the_steppe_desc: "Whether it is the steppe near the mouth of the Dnieper River or the steppe that is east of it, we have been plagued by steppe nomads for ages now. Russian cities like Ryazan, Moscow, and Tver have seen countless raids by these fiends in the past and the old power structures were not able to withstand the onslaught of these ruthless marauders, but Russia... Russia is far different from those old states... We will utilize gunpowder weapons in whatever form they may take and we will, through sheer brute force or through skilled seizure of towns and villages, tame these unruly steppe hordes. There will be an end to their terror, and it will be the Russian flag that stands atop their burned out settlements."
 move_the_earth_with_cannons: "Moving the Earth with Cannons"
 move_the_earth_with_cannons_desc: "What we have learned from our experience with dealing with steppe nomads and also with our foes in the west is the fact that, cannons are the way of the future. They move the earth like no other siege engine before and are far better at breaking into fortifications than ladders, trebuchets, or tunnel digging. Russia's artillery henceforth become one of the strongest in all of Europe, just so long as we can afford to keep them in production and updated as new and better versions are invented by our engineers."
 serve_for_life_serve_to_die: "Serve for Life; Serve to Die"
 serve_for_life_serve_to_die_desc: "Russia is a vast empire, is it not? Our lands stretch from horizon to horizon in many places, which means we are going to need a hefty amount of soldiers to ensure that the land is secure when at peace, and also to expand said land when at war. Our solution to this issue is that of cheap soldiers that can be recruited for life; they need not be armed to the point of some other armies in Western Europe, they only need just enough equipment to fight and just enough money to keep them alive, nothing more. They will be cheap, large in number, and willing to fight and die for the motherland."
 do_away_with_the_old_boyars: "Old Boyars No More"
 do_away_with_the_old_boyars_desc: "We cannot cling to old social and societal traditions if we are to keep going as a strong and robust empire. Boyars of old noble families are righteous in some senses, but the issue at hand is their noble blood getting them high positions in society when someone more educated and more qualified is available. We need to actively work to break down these old traditions and instill a much more merit-based system of administration so that Russia as a whole can benefit from educated advisors, ministers, and governors."
 serfs_for_life_serfs_without_mobility: "Serfs for Life; Serfs in Place"
 serfs_for_life_serfs_without_mobility_desc: "Though we do appreciate the changes we have put in place for the higher classes of Russian society, the lower classes are not deserving of as much attention. They need to be working the land and being ready to serve Russia when they are called upon; serfdom is simply going to be the law of the land in the majority of our empire. It may be unappealing to outsiders, but we have no need of these peasants gaining social mobility, no, we need them to keep to their own social class with no objections."

 #Rostov Ideas#
 memories_of_sarkoya_gorodishche: "Memories of Sarkoya Gorodishche"
 memories_of_sarkoya_gorodishche_desc: "It is an old memory, but one that should not be forgotten in Rostov. Before the rise of our city, there was the fortified village of sorts named 'Sarkoya Gorodishche'. There are plenty of mysteries surrounding it but it remains one of the foundational pieces of history for our people and our capital city. Its purpose as a fortified village should be remembered and kept close so that, in the future when we expand Rostov itself, the city expands its own fortifications too."
 memories_of_rostov_suzdal: "Rostov-Suzdal and Vladimir-Suzdal"
 memories_of_rostov_suzdal_desc: "The power of Rostov crystallized some centuries ago as Suzdal and Vladimir rose to power with the fall of the Kievan Rus in the west. At first, Rostov-Suzdal took power as things tumbled down, and then Vladimir took Rostov's place and the state became known as Vladimir-Suzdal. And yet, Rostov stood by throughout that time as a strong economic city near the other two, thriving and prospering. We could actually use these old claims from Vladimir-Suzdal to enforce our own expansions throughout these lands, being a worthy successor to the old grand duchy."
 a_pillar_of_eastern_orthodoxy: "A Pillar of Russian Orthodoxy"
 a_pillar_of_eastern_orthodoxy_desc: "What helped Rostov transform from a small village of sorts into a bustling city of trade and wealth (before the Mongols came through) was the fact that Rostov was a center of Eastern Orthodoxy. From our city many places were converted around us and powerful bishops and archbishops came to be seated either in or very close to Rostov itself. Let us carry forth this religious legacy into the future no matter what happens to our internal politics."
 elevation_from_archbishops_to_metropolitans: "From Archbishops to Metropolitans"
 elevation_from_archbishops_to_metropolitans_desc: "The ambition of our religious figures are not political in nature, but rather they are clerical in nature. They seek to be the center of Russian Orthodoxy and to have the seat of our faith be in Rostov and Rostov alone. To have a Rostov Metropolitan Bishop is going to be tough as the metropolitan currently has his chair with Moscow, but with enough coercion, internal growth, and decisive political moves, we can get a future metropolitan move the chair to Rostov."
 build_a_kremlin_for_rostov: "A Kremlin for Rostov"
 build_a_kremlin_for_rostov_desc: "The Mongols left a number of harsh scars and memories with the Russian people, and it is from these scars and memories that they must learn from. Part of this is the fact that having a fortified city center is a must, especially for capitals like Rostov. If we can work to build up a proper kremlin in the heart of Rostov and ensure it is engineered to withstand any attack whilst also displaying our prosperity, we will earn more trust from our own people and cultivate a stronger capital city."
 revitalize_enamel_production: "Enamels of Rostov"
 revitalize_enamel_production_desc: "Vitreous, or, porcelain enamel is something Rostov has been manufacturing for many generations now. By fusing powdered glass to a basis of some kind through fiery temperatures, we create beautiful pieces of glass, metal, ceramics, or stone that many value to a high degree. Continuing this traditional work in Rostov and perhaps even building places specifically to house enamel artists could bolster Rostov's reputation and trade power abroad."
 rostov_veliky: "Rostov Veliky"
 rostov_veliky_desc: "Is it enough that Rostov is rebounding from the days of the Mongol Yoke? No, economic growth and political stability are rewards in their own right but they alone are not fit for Rostov and its great past. We of Rostov must look toward battling the other states of the Rus for hegemony over the land and uniting these separate cities such as Novgorod, Moscow, Tver, and Pskov. By the end of it all, the name that will be on the lips of our people and those near and far will be 'Rostov Veliky', Great Rostov"

 #Tverian Ideas#
 old_rivals_in_northwest_russia: "Old Rivals; Old Feuds"
 old_rivals_in_northwest_russia_desc: "From our very inception, Tver has needed its sword drawn and shield at the ready for whatever happened around it. Moscow, Suzdal, Novgorod, and so many others too, they were all and still are potential enemies of Tver. It is because of this tense and hostile history that we must reinforce our claims through war, not diplomacy."
 extreme_anti_tatar_sentiment: "Extreme Anti-Tatar Sentiment"
 extreme_anti_tatar_sentiment_desc: "From the Tver Uprising in 1327 to other smaller revolts, Tver has always been a haven for people who refused to obey the Mongol Yoke. It is, however, with great sadness that we remember how brutally our efforts were suppressed; so many civilians and righteous fighters killed as reprisals, and many in the royal family descended of Yaroslav III were executed. With these scars on our heart and our people ready for whatever could come next, Tver will fight for every last bit of land that it can."
 refuse_the_power_of_moscow: "The Russian Chess Board"
 refuse_the_power_of_moscow_desc: "The pieces that move around on the chess board that is the states of the Rus are trying to get whatever power they can in the shortest amount of time. Many see the rise of Moscow on this board as inevitable, but we of Tver refuse this notion altogether. We are ready to hold out in our small corner of the board, complete with fortifications and loyal soldiers at the ready. If we have to draw this chess game out for years and decades to defeat Moscow, we will do exactly that."
 rein_in_kashin_kholm_zubtsov: "Unification of Tver"
 rein_in_kashin_kholm_zubtsov_desc: "As the 1300s went on and Moscow continued to gain influence, they chipped away at the authority of Tver and made some of its neighboring lands semi-independent (Kashin, Kholm, and Zubtsov). This greatly reduced the power of Tver as a whole and made it into a mere pawn on the Russian chess board, instead of perhaps a bishop or a knight. Now is the time that we must rein in these autonomous lands that Moscow has sought from us; unification is not going to be an option for them, not after they helped bring about our decline in the past."
 exiled_princes_no_more: "No Longer in Exile"
 exiled_princes_no_more_desc: "Tver's time in exile because of the events of the past has been formative to say the least. We have learned much in the way of city building, succession laws, military organizing, and even diplomatic endeavors, all of this culminating in a more reformed and established Tver that cannot be pushed around like before. Learning from the past is not easy, but Tver has been forced to do just that."
 friends_in_hostile_places: "Look to Outside Help"
 friends_in_hostile_places_desc: "In the past, we have looked to outside states for help against the rising threat of Moscow. During the reign of Mikhail II, he strived to ally the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against Moscow and the Golden Horde, but unfortunately this led to the other princes around Tver invading and dismantling even more of Tver's base of power. Thus, it is these harsh lessons in outside diplomacy that we must learn from so that in the future, we are not hampered by unfortunate diplomatic circumstances."
 tempered_and_scarred_past: "The Rise of Tver"
 tempered_and_scarred_past_desc: "The scars of our past, the tempering of our ambition, all of it goes into the military force of Tver. We have not been able to rely on money and diplomacy like Novgorod, nor have we been able to rely on a stalwart administration to keep us afloat. What matters at the end of it all is military might and Tver has learned this after its failures in the past against not only Moscow, but against the Mongols as well. The rise of Tver is now at hand."

 #Yaroslavl Ideas#
 remembering_the_battle_of_the_sit_river: "The Battle of the Sit River"
 remembering_the_battle_of_the_sit_river_desc: "It was the fateful Battle of the Sit River in March of 1238 that decided the fate of many Russian people, including those of Yaroslavl. The death of Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal and the death of Vsevolod Konstantinovich of Yaroslavl meant that the Mongols were able to sack a great many cities, including our very own city that sits on the banks of the Volga River. Let us never forget this tragic battle and what blood we shed during it, for the blood shed back then has only strengthened our resolve for the future in the hopes of keeping Yaroslavl safe forever more."
 amidst_rus_dynastic_movements: "Dynastic Movements in the Rus"
 amidst_rus_dynastic_movements_desc: "There are several shifts in the dynastic matters of the Rus principalities. Whether it is a bride from Rostov marrying into Moscow or someone from Tver marrying into our own lineage and so on and so forth, we of Yaroslavl would be wise to keep track of these changes in who is married to who and which leader is allied to which state."
 revenge_against_moscow: "Revenge Against Moscow"
 revenge_against_moscow_desc: "We have not forgotten what Ivan I of Moscow did to our dear city back in the early 1300s. 1332 was that fateful year when he burned down part of our city under the order of the Mongol Khan at the time, thus weakening Yaroslavl in general. When we are able to, we will do just the same to Moscow and exact revenge on the princes of Moscow so that they may feel how we felt during that time of blazing destruction."
 from_wood_to_stone_buildings: "Lessons from Wooden Buildings"
 from_wood_to_stone_buildings_desc: "We would be mistaken if we thought that Yaroslavl's burning on multiple occasions was the fault of foreigners alone; part of it is because of our own design philosophy. We have made buildings out of wood for so long now that stone buildings seem almost strange to many of Yaroslavl, but we cannot deny the fact that if Yaroslavl is to grow and prosper, the wooden buildings need to be replaced with something less prone to fire. Thus, the easiest solution? Stone buildings."
 independent_identity_from_moscow: "Independent Yaroslavl Identity"
 independent_identity_from_moscow_desc: "Moscow's center of trade and culture pulls in many great minds, that is true, but Yaroslavl has its own perks and potential that can be realized over time if given the resources to do so. Managing as are, if we can keep our independent city away from Muscovite influences and cultivate a stronger Yaroslavl for both civilian and administrative purposes, we will surely be the envy of all other cities in the Rus in due time."
 appanages_of_yaroslavl_reined_in: "Enforce the Will of Yaroslavl"
 appanages_of_yaroslavl_reined_in_desc: "It is not by choice that pieces of Yaroslavl were taken away previously in order to be made into semi-independent principalities. Now that Yaroslavl is looking up in the world, we will look toward introducing these lands back into fold of Yaroslavl through more peaceful and diplomatic approaches; we would rather not expend more military resources than what is necessary if diplomacy works just as well."
 connecting_yaroslavls_pieces: "Stone Buildings, Stone Roads"
 connecting_yaroslavls_pieces_desc: "With the transition to stone buildings set in motion for Yaroslavl and its surrounding villages and towns, the work toward building a proper road network throughout our land is well under way. Stone roads instead of rough dirt paths will facilitate easier movement for anyone and everyone, meaning faster communication between communities and an even stronger administration stemming from Yaroslavl."

 #Perm, but really Komi, Ideas#
 weakened_novgorod_authority: "More Autonomy for the Komi People"
 weakened_novgorod_authority_desc: "As the authority of Novgorod weakened over the 1300s and 1400s, we, the Komi people, have come into our own. Our state is more autonomous than before and we are governing politics in a manner in which Novgorod would never have let happen previously. Now we must still fear the wrath of Muscovite princes here and there, but for now, the Komi people can look forward to a more prosperous future where they can handle their own military and political matters at a certain scale."
 ready_to_play_off_three_powers: "Ready Player 4"
 ready_to_play_off_three_powers_desc: "The three powers that have come to define the 1400s near us are Kazan, Muscovy, and Novgorod. Though we are on the outer perimeter of politics for these three powerful states, the Komi people are not without vision on what political shifts happen to their west and south. If we are to expand our power even slightly, we must be ready to play these three off of each other whenever we can as a subtle yet key 4th Player."
 amidst_forests_of_the_komi: "Amidst the Forests of the Komi"
 amidst_forests_of_the_komi_desc: "Forests and rivers are what dominate the landscape of the Komi. Our state has scattered villages and towns of course, but none can deny that if fights take place in our land, it is among the forests and woods and by the rivers and creeks. If commanders and soldiers don't know how to navigate these lands, they will die by those that do, and just who exactly are the masters of this kind of warfare? The Komi people of course."
 cultivate_river_trade_chances: "River Trade Chances"
 cultivate_river_trade_chances_desc: "We thrive off trade through the rivers that flow in our land; it is one of the key reasons why Novgorod kept us around as a tributary state of sorts in previous centuries. Thanks to their decline in influence and the steady rise of Komi power though, river trading has become more common and the profits are flowing into our pockets most if not all the time. Establishing more secure river crossings and outposts alongside the rivers will only increase how far we can send our merchants and how much they can bring back with them."
 offensive_advantages_stop_here: "Permafrost Defense"
 offensive_advantages_stop_here_desc: "Bolstering our defenses is not an easy thing to do since our lands are harder to develop as a whole. What helps us out in this regard is nature itself as the Komi people have come to partly rely on nature providing partial cover from projectiles and obstacles that large hulking armies can't move around easily. Knowing where these key points of defense are and building more defenses around them will be what can boost the Komi defense strategy by leaps and bounds."
 open_up_fields_for_grazing: "Southern Lands for Grazing"
 open_up_fields_for_grazing_desc: "The lands to the south of our capital are warmer and have less trees in general, meaning they are fit for a different kind of lifestyle. Grazing herds of horses and cattle are much more suited to these conditions as opposed to up north, which is why we will sponsor segments of our population to settle the southern lands and open up more proper fields for grazing herds of animals. These herds should be able to help supply our military with horses and baggage animals alike."
 land_of_the_endless_towers: "Endless Wood for Endless Defenses"
 land_of_the_endless_towers_desc: "We are already making use of the natural defenses given to us by nature, and we utilize the cold weather as well as our own expertise in forest combat to our advantage, but what else can we do to keep the Komi people safe and to keep our state safe from invasions? Why, we can begin to build outposts and towers to dot the landscape, intricate in their design and sturdy in their construction so that they cannot be toppled or broken down without a great amount of force. With the amount of timber ready to use too, these fortified outposts and towers will be the bane of any enemies that dare set foot in our land."

 #Beloozero Ideas#
 once_ruled_partly_by_khans: "How Beloozero Began"
 once_ruled_partly_by_khans_desc: "Beloozero was rife with growth in the times before 1400. What began as a principality detached from Rostov around 1238 grew into a prosperous place ruled by Prince Gleb who married Sartaq Khan's daughter. In this sense, Beloozero was partly ruled by khans of the past and can easily call upon this partial heritage to drum up support for conquests around the Rus. It won't be easy considering how strong Moscow and Novgorod remain as of the 1400s, but Beloozero has seen more drastic shifts in power before."
 the_rural_north_of_the_rus: "The Rural North"
 the_rural_north_of_the_rus_desc: "Where we are situated, there are far fewer towns and villages than there are when compared to southern places like Smolensk, Moscow, and Chernigov. This isolation is ideal for a defense-oriented warfare which Beloozero's military is already trained in. If our enemies cannot reach the heart of Beloozero without losing a few hundreds or thousands of troops to the cold and forested terrain, we will have far greater chances of eliminating them altogether."
 what_moscow_gives_we_accept: "Benefits from Moscow"
 what_moscow_gives_we_accept_desc: "The Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery and the Ferapontov Monastery were built in 1397 and 1398 respectively, and both are key points of interest to the pious Eastern Orthodox folks who travel to Beloozero. Maintaining these monasteries that were granted to us by descendants of Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow will keep the name 'Beloozero' in the minds of many, in a positive way of course. If Moscow were to give us even more funding for additional prestigious structures, we would only be happy to accept such offers."
 a_hand_in_northern_trade: "A Hand in Northern Trade"
 a_hand_in_northern_trade_desc: "The rural northern lands of the Rus are not completely desolate or isolated; Novgorod has shown us and many others that there are trade routes that run through these lands so that fur can be transported to more western and southern markets. If Beloozero can perhaps build more markets and designate more clearings for traders to pass through, its trade power in the north will rise as time goes on and perhaps even replace Novgorod's trade power."
 raise_up_beloozeros_family: "Northern Royalty"
 raise_up_beloozeros_family_desc: "Though some would look upon our royal family with a shrug or a roll of the eyes, they aren't as weak as some would predict. The monasteries and markets that they hold sway over have given Beloozero a higher sense of worth and influence all around the northern parts of the Rus, meaning that more and more high minded people are making their way toward our capital city. Let us make room for these intellectuals in our own court, for their skills are exactly what can give Beloozero the edge it needs in the politics of the Rus."
 the_borael_forests_shield_us: "The Great Boreal Forests"
 the_borael_forests_shield_us_desc: "Much like in the eastern principality of the Komi people, Beloozero is rife with forests that are just waiting to be used for defensive purposes. Though we should avoid building all our structures out of wood for fear of fires being able to spread easily, constructing scattered yet connected defenses in the form of outposts and towers would help keep Beloozero's core safe from harm."
 organizing_all_of_the_northern_trade: "Seize All Northern Trade Routes"
 organizing_all_of_the_northern_trade_desc: "With unprecedented growth happening all throughout Beloozero, it is only right that we seize all of the trade routes in the north so that we may control all the income that stems from such trade routes. And if southern powers or towns think they can strike at Beloozero's economy in some way (like through embargoes), we can easily cut them off from the vital northern trade routes that supply us. A great deal of the Rus depends on the profits of the fur trade, and us having a powerful grip over it means we will have a powerful grip over other states in the Rus."

 #Novgorod Ideas#
 rivals_on_two_sides_of_novgorod: "Threats in Moscow, Vilnius, and Krakow"
 rivals_on_two_sides_of_novgorod_desc: "For many decades Novgorod now we have faced threats coming from our southwest and our southeast. The Poles and Lithuanians seek to take over the Baltic whilst Moscow seeks to end Novgorod altogether, and yet we still stand here, ready to defend our state and our principles and what territory that we have fought for in previous centuries. The time is now for us to expand our military arsenal for the coming years of war since we know very well that our traditional rivals are not going to stop fighting against us until they are firmly dead."
 sustain_novgorods_economic_importance: "Retain Economic Importance"
 sustain_novgorods_economic_importance_desc: "Whilst the people of Novgorod participated in economic matters such as catching fish for food, obtaining salt for a number of matters, and growing crops like flax and hops, what has been the life-blood of Novgorod since its inception has been the fur trade. Even as it declines slowly over time due to new sources of fur opening up to European markets, we can still strive to maintain our economic importance by building up markets and towns so that merchants can make more of a profit off of various resources that come from Novgorod. This should go hand-in-hand with keeping control over the northern trade routes of course."
 memories_of_the_struggles_against_catholics: "The Wall Against Catholics"
 memories_of_the_struggles_against_catholics_desc: "Ever since the Teutonic Knights and the Catholic Scandinavians started to look eastward in the 1200s, Novgorod was the one staunch barrier to spreading Catholicism in what was then fairly fresh Eastern Orthodox grounds. This wall against Catholicism has remained stalwart ever since this time period and was shown off in magnificent fashion in the Battle on the Ice in 1242. Like how Alexander Nevsky led Novgorod's forces on that day, we will do so in the future and preserve Eastern Orthodoxy against all Catholic incursions."
 development_without_the_mongol_scourge: "Artistic Talent of Novgorod"
 development_without_the_mongol_scourge_desc: "Unlike the cities of Suzdal, Rostov, Tver, and Moscow, Novogorod boasts considerable fame for its artwork of various kinds, from that which is done by the hands of a single artisan to that which is done by a team of engineers. Prominent boyar families in our land have and still do commission detailed and elaborate icons and also churches and cathedrals around our land have many detailed icons that show off just how much prowess we have in terms of artistry. So long as our grand state lives on, so too will our artistic endeavors."
 let_all_classes_in_novgorod_read: "Manuscripts and Books for All Citizens"
 let_all_classes_in_novgorod_read_desc: "We do not see our peasants and merchants like how Moscow or Krakow see their own. Novgorod is not keen on keeping knowledge from its peasantry, or, at least not to the level of our neighbors. The manuscripts written by either men or women in our land may be read by peasants, merchants, or boyars, all should be able to as time goes on and as more are produced. Some will find this aspect of Novgorod strange, but, we see it as a righteous endeavor; knowledge shouldn't be limited to just those of prominent status."
 the_importance_of_neva: "Expand our Baltic Sea Influence"
 the_importance_of_neva_desc: "Whilst we have not been the greatest at projecting our influence out at sea due to various matters keeping our attention geared toward the mainland, the time is coming where we can finally pay more attention to the place wher most of our sea trade goes: The Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden, and the Hanseatic League will still be thorns in the side of Novgorod's trade sector, but the more time we dedicate to building trade ships and establishing trade relations, the more influence we will obtain over time."
 protests_spur_political_development: "Listen to the Reasons of Peasants"
 protests_spur_political_development_desc: "Numerous times since we have existed as an independent political entity there have been peasant protests and some serious revolts. These revolts weren't like the ones we see in the monarchies of Europe though, as they were more aimed wanting better ruling from the upper classes. Thus, when we encounter future protests and riots, we shouldn't meet these people with executions at every turn, we should instead look to what they have to say and learn to compromise at points with those who are, for better or for worse, the majority of the population in our state. Novgorod is not one to oppress its population, not like the princes of Moscow."

 #Odoyev Ideas#
 bordering_the_steppe_to_our_south: "Precarious Circumstances..."
 bordering_the_steppe_to_our_south_desc: "Since our inception, Odoyev has been subjected to various raids, skirmishes, and conquests from both the steppe and from the settled people of the Rus. We have not sought to cut down our enemies because we know we are not powerful enough (for now, that is), but we will seek out is good trade deals with both our steppe neighbors and our Rus relatives. Guarding these trade routes along the Oka River also gives us a great deal of practice in manning the walls and fortifications we have already built."
 caught_between_lithuania_and_moscow: "... Necessitates Several Compromises"
 caught_between_lithuania_and_moscow_desc: "In the early 1400s, our small duchy was the subject of debate and conquest by Lithuania whilst Muscovy's power in the east was on the rise. Though we were snatched by Lithuania firstly in those early decades of the 1400s, Muscovy struck back later on and thus the influence of both powerful states clashed in and around Odoyev itself. If we are to save our lowly capital from destruction akin to what happened in May of 1407, then we must be ready to negotiate at all times with Muscovite princes and Lithuanian grand dukes."
 lending_and_receiving_troops: "Border Region for Two Giants"
 lending_and_receiving_troops_desc: "Being that Odoyev is a sort of border region for Lithuanians and Muscovites, it is fitting that we see a fair deal of troop movements across our territory. These troops of course are not always ours as some are clearly mercenary bands hired by either power for their own purposes, but that does not stop Odoyev from perhaps offering these mercenary bands a better deal. They're roaming our land from time to time anyways, why not buy them out and perhaps ensure our own safety?"
 tribute_in_exchange_for_land_was_our_status: "What Belongs to Odoyev Princes"
 tribute_in_exchange_for_land_was_our_status_desc: "In the treaty of 1427 between the House of Novosil and Odoyev with the Grand Duke of Lithuania at the time, Vytautas the Great, our leaders would be the subject of the Lithuania and given land within Lithuania itself, so long yearly tribute was paid. This treaty is long since gone due to new leaders and new officials coming to power, but we can still easily press claims we have on Lithuanian land and maybe even land we lost in the east. Tribute for land can be a dangerous deal sometimes, it's just hard to see how bad it could be in the future."
 transition_from_novosil_to_odoyev: "No Longer of Novosil"
 transition_from_novosil_to_odoyev_desc: "Whilst in the past we styled ourselves as 'Dukes of Novosil', this has become relatively outdated as we have come to center ourselves not at Novosil, but instead at Odoyev. Fully moving our seat of power to Odoyev in every sense would instill a greater amount of trust in our people and, as Odoyev continues to develop, bring forth more prosperity to our own royal house."
 defenses_of_the_oka_river: "Oka River Defenses"
 defenses_of_the_oka_river_desc: "The very river on which we derive our life and prosperity is that of the Oka River, this is no secret to anyone. Defending it with whatever we can though is something that is becoming increasingly clear to our own population, this motivation of which we are only too happy to indulge. Whether it is stronger and more deeply laid garrisons or thicker walls for our fortifications, we of Odoyev will be the righteous defender of the Oka River no matter what."
 southern_stronghold_rising: "From Lowly Outpost to Stalwart Bastion"
 southern_stronghold_rising_desc: "For many decades now, Odoyev has been looked at as a mere border region, a land that was merely in reserve for any large power capable of holding it down for an extended period of time. But is that time of conquest truly coming? We simply won't wait to find out as there are too many things to get done in Odoyev! We are a rising bastion of defended trade routes and prosperous state mixed with Russian, Lithuanian, and Tatar people. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Odoyev continues to be a southern bastion of greatness no matter what is imposed on us from any direction."

 #Chernhiv Ideas#
 what_once_was_chernigov: "What was the 'City of Legends'"
 what_once_was_chernigov_desc: "It was during the 1000s to early 1200s that the Grand Principality of Chernigov was at its peak. Striving for power against Kiev in many instances whilst also holding its own power and even helping Kiev at times when it suited Chernigov as a whole, our history is rich with stories of conflict, affection, and prestige. Upholding this heritage of ours and building up Chernigov into a strong power in the region once more will earn us the respect and loyalty of the citizens we rule over."
 kievan_dependence_on_chernigov: "Second Only to Kiev"
 kievan_dependence_on_chernigov_desc: "While Yaroslav the Wise ruled over Kiev and Novgorod from 1019 to 1054, Mstislav ruled over Chernigov from 1024 to 1036 and helped cultivate it into an important center of trade, administration, and Eastern Orthodoxy through religious patronage. Though after Mstislav's death Chernigov was integrated back into Kiev for the duration of Yaroslav's reign, the mark Mstislav made was never undone as Chernigov remained a viable competitor to Kiev's administrative power. In time we will make this known once more and re-establish order throughout the old lands of Chernigov as well as all of the Rus."
 developments_of_chernihiv_cities: "Confluence of Many Developments"
 developments_of_chernihiv_cities_desc: "Our capital city was decimated by the forces of Batu Khan in 1239; this drastic event started a long period of hardship for all who called Chernigov home. Still though, there is life in this old city and in the royalty as well as courtiers who still reside in Chernigov and its nearby villages. Promoting developments in agriculture, infrastructure, and even simple road building will go a long way in restoring Chernigov's internal power and authority whilst also ensuring that its economic prospects rebound upward from those lowly times of the 1200s and 1300s."
 compound_on_our_religious_importance: "Religious Heart in the South"
 compound_on_our_religious_importance_desc: "One of the most outstanding places in all of Chernigov is the Transfiguration Cathedral, commissioned by Mstislav and then finished by Yaroslav the Wise in the mid-1000s. Renovating the cathedral itself, promoting more religious development through the construction of monasteries, and establishing firm authority for our Orthodox leadership will help cement Chernigov as a bastion of Eastern Orthodoxy in the south of the Rus."
 militarized_frontier_area: "Frontiers of Chernigov"
 militarized_frontier_area_desc: "Few would say that Chernigov is a truly peaceful place; time and time again its lands are crossed by roving bands of cossacks and mercenaries alike. In a sense, these militarized groups have forced our hand in militarizing Chernigov as a whole, even more so than when we faced threats from the Cumans and Kievan civil wars. Formalized training measures, loyal and brave commanders, and a robust system of command that is developed properly over time will give Chernigov the edge it needs to sustain itself, regardless of the threats that come forth."
 adaptation_to_steppe_warfare: "Learning from Steppe Hordes"
 adaptation_to_steppe_warfare_desc: "If it was not for the steppe hordes to our south and southeast, where would Chernigov be? Perhaps much better off or perhaps integrated fully into the Kievan Rus, but that would take away the valuable lessons we have learned over the generations in regards to how they fight. Unlike the traditional shield walls and heavy infantry/cavalry charges our northern neighbors were used to, we have grown up around both those tactics and steppe horde tactics being used on us extensively. Utilizing these tactics in the form of an organized light cavalry arm that can skirmish effectively will put Chernigov well ahead of other states in the Rus."
 an_understanding_with_jews: "Recognize Religious Minorities"
 an_understanding_with_jews_desc: "We are not exactly fond of Muslim minorities or Jewish minorities in the lands of Chernigov as our ecclesiastic authority dictates that we should be bringing their souls to God through conversions, but we cannot hide from the fact that these communities of religious minorities in Chernigov contribute a fair amount to our economy as it is. Angering them through forced conversion would simply cause undue tension and unrest and slow down our economy, so in the interest of our state as a whole instead of just the clergy themselves, we will take steps to formally recognize these minorities and protect them."

 #Polotsk Ideas#
 the_great_vseslav_of_polotsk: "Vseslav of Polotsk's Legacy"
 the_great_vseslav_of_polotsk_desc: "The reign of Vseslav of Polotsk is legendary to many for good reasons. Excluded from grand princely succession due to how the lineage lined up in dynastic matters during the days of the Kievan Rus, he took matters into his own hands and pillaged parts of the Kievan Rus, laid siege to Pskov without success, pillaged and burnt Novgorod for the benefit of his cathedral in Polotsk, and he even came close to cutting off the sons of Yaroslav from valuable northern trade. During the Kiev Uprising of 1068, the crowds freed Vseslav from his captivity (since he lost the Battle of the Nemiga River in 1067) and placed him on the throne, though only for a single year. Still, he made Polotsk into a serious force to be reckoned with and we will follow in his very footsteps!"
 from_scandinavia_to_russian_lands: "The Flow of Trade Kept Safe"
 from_scandinavia_to_russian_lands_desc: "From Scandinavia and from the Rus, trade flows back and forth across the lands of Polotsk and its surroundings. Keeping to our traditional heritage of securing these valued trade routes so that merchants from all around us are safe is what will garner Polotsk more and more revenue and influence."
 the_heavy_fortifications_of_polotsk: "Embrasures, Towers, Walls!"
 the_heavy_fortifications_of_polotsk_desc: "During our shining period under the rule of Vseslav of Polotsk, our capital was described by Norse sagas at the time as one of the most fortified towns in the entire Kievan Rus. Though this is very much not the case anymore since the Kievan Rus is long dead and Polotsk has witnessed a staggering decline since Vseslav's generation, we can still make an effort to rebound upward and fortify our capital once more. It will take years of manpower and money, but it will be worth it in the end so that we can promote a strong and cultivated capital city."
 lessons_on_dyanstic_bonds: "The Lasting Bonds of Marriage"
 lessons_on_dyanstic_bonds_desc: "Polotsk made several ties to local communities and polities near the Baltic coast, but these dynastic bonds did not stop the incoming tide of crusading knights from the west that plagued our various allies and family members. Still though, this period of mingling with and forming relations with foreign states taught us the value of dynastic bonds. They can be useful far into the future and can help promote influence in lands still controlled by hostile forces, such as the Teutons in our case."
 the_cooler_cathedral_of_holy_wisdom: "The Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, but Better!"
 the_cooler_cathedral_of_holy_wisdom_desc: "The Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in Polotosk was not that noticeable prior to what Vseslav did during his reign, but afterwards, it was something to marvel at. In his raiding and pillaging of Novgorod, he looted Novgorod's own Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and took its bell as well as other decorations back to Polotsk. Even though some from Novgorod petition us to give back these holy relics and prestigious decorations, we have no need to do so; they make our grand cathedral even more beautiful and allow for more relations to be fostered with Christian states that aren't inside the Rus."
 beat_back_teutonic_incursions: "Teutonic Incursions Turned Back"
 beat_back_teutonic_incursions_desc: "Ever since the Teutonic knights invaded the Baltic lands and forced their ways upon the people there, it has become a haven for Catholic, anti-Rus sentiment that must be put down sooner rather than later. We are lucky that both the Teutonic range of influence is shrinking more and more thanks to the work of the Polish, Lithuanians, and even some Teutonic administrators themselves. Soon enough it will be Polotsk's turn to stick a blade into the bleeding knight trying to hold on to what influence it has; it is only a matter of time."
 crossroads_of_eastern_europe: "The People of Polotsk"
 crossroads_of_eastern_europe_desc: "We have in our land a great many people from various cultural backgrounds: some are from Denmark and Sweden, others are Lithuanian or Polish in descent, and yet still others are Livonian or Estonian. All of these languages and cultures flowing into Polotsk's borders means that there will be a great deal of cross-cultural dialogue and tension, but we can start to mitigate the latter by recognizing and extending rights to those who do not speak our own language or practice our own traditions."

 #Smolensk Ideas#
 a_veche_worth_listening_to: "A Veche Worth Listening To"
 a_veche_worth_listening_to_desc: "The popular assembly (also called the 'veche') in Smolensk is by no means as powerful as it is in places like Novgorod or Pskov, but it still has a decent amount of influence throughout Smolensk as a whole. We cannot disregard everything it brings up as that would grind politics to a halt and leave Smolensk decaying internally. Instead, we will seek out compromises with our veche when and where possible whilst aiming to have the highest authority figure have the final say."
 spared_from_fire_but_not_from_servitude: "Costly Survival"
 spared_from_fire_but_not_from_servitude_desc: "Whilst we were not burned to the ground during the invasion of the Mongols from the east, we were subjugated by the Lithuanians to our west and made to pay tribute on multiple occasions. This time of being forced to work the land for a different nation wasn't all bad though as it helped us develop a stronger and more robust infrastructure as well as a greater understanding of how to plan out our capital's expansion. With this knowledge in mind and more innovations coming our way, Smolensk will be set for a bright future in terms of economic development."
 hardened_by_vyutautas_invasions: "Vyutautas's Lessons"
 hardened_by_vyutautas_invasions_desc: "The grand duke of Lithuania in the late 1300s and early 1400s, Vyutautas the Great, he was the one who captured Smolensk on three occasions: 1395, 1404, and finally in 1408. We were integrated into Lithuania after this point on, but now that we are free from that old integrated past, we can utilize the lessons that Vyutautas imparted onto Smolensk's military. A stronger and more capable military with confidence in itself and enough dedication for Smolensk itself will serve to cement our military's potential for the future."
 knowledge_of_lithuanian_governance: "Influences from Lithuania"
 knowledge_of_lithuanian_governance_desc: "Not only is our military influenced by Lithuania's own, but our government itself is too. From the way we organize our provinces and towns to the way we handle things like taxes, trade income, deficits in spending, and collecting tribute, it all has influences from the old grand duchy itself. We may not care much for Lithuania as of today, but we cannot deny the foundation they gave Smolensk as a whole."
 central_kremlin_of_smolensk: "The First Step of a Strong Capital"
 central_kremlin_of_smolensk_desc: "Yet, even as we have been influenced by Lithuania, we have our own traditions imparted to us by the Kievan Rus and the states of the Rus to the east. Perhaps the most shining example of these traditions will be the kremlin in the heart of Smolensk itself, fit for a proper monarch who rules the splendid and prosperous land that is what we hold. It will be a functional and detailed kremlin of course, not just a simple palace or fort with nothing more to it."
 revamped_heavy_fortifications: "Insurance Against Future Invasions"
 revamped_heavy_fortifications_desc: "Much like how Smolensk was during the days of the Kievan Rus, we will begin to emulate the central strength of Smolensk outward through heavy fortifications that utilize not only muskets thick walls, but also defensive artillery too. Cannons that are able to be mounted on certain wall pieces for fortifications would do greatly in terms of helping protect against future sieges."
 wall_between_the_plc_and_the_rus: "The Value in Smolensk"
 wall_between_the_plc_and_the_rus_desc: "For ages now Smolensk has been valued as a trade hub, an administrative center, a haven for Christians going west or east, and also a vital point to capture when wars break out throughout Eastern Europe. As we cultivate our land further and further, this value in Smolensk is only going to grow further which is why we will capitalize on said increasing value by seeking out better diplomatic deals with whatever neighbors are near us. Survival is not only done by fighting, it is also done by diplomatic means."

 #Nizhny Novgorod Ideas#
 in_the_model_of_novgorod: "Looking up to Novgorod"
 in_the_model_of_novgorod_desc: "In the north, Novgorod stands as a bastion of art and glory that we aspire to be like. Whilst their Veche is far too powerful for our liking, the citizens of Nizhny Novgorod are slowly coming to realize just how valuable the position of the city is. Soon enough, the trade routes that flow into and out of Nizhny Novgorod will be flourishing! It just takes careful cultivation and a delicate grasp on politics, both of which we reach for time and time again."
 kurmysh_fortress_and_others: "Kurmysh Fortress"
 kurmysh_fortress_and_others_desc: "Founded in 1372 and perhaps unremarkable to those outside Nizhny Novgorod, our people realize it for what it is: a defensive landmark that proves we can survive and thrive out here in the border region of the Rus and the steppe. In time, we can work toward expanding it through new towers, walls, and even transitioning it from being partly made of wood to being entirely made of stone. If we give it a few generations of work, Kurmysh Fortress will be a Russian symbol of might in the border region."
 learn_from_edigus_destruction: "Edigu's Destruction"
 learn_from_edigus_destruction_desc: "Even though we tell ourselves that we are mighty and strong, able to withstand many blows before giving in, the past tells a different story. 1408 saw the White Horde's leader named Edigu leave a trail of misery and destruction through Nizhny Novgorod, setting its people back decades in terms of prosperity and economic progress. We have come far from this bloody point in our past and we have learned much in the way of organizing our communities so that they are better prepared for invasions and better able to rebuild from disasters that befall them."
 repel_the_tatar_advances: "Build up the Defenses!"
 repel_the_tatar_advances_desc: "And as we continue to shape our communities so that they are fit for this border region between the Rus and the steppe, we will ensure that our walls and garrison spaces are well prepared for whatever cavalry army comes their way. Muskets will be stocked up and ready, gunpowder will be safely stored, and the gates to each fortification will be secured with multiple layers of defense. We simply cannot let our past be written again by yet another steppe horde seeking to reinstate the old yoke upon the Russians."
 regular_movement_of_regiments: "Steppe Lessons on Mobility"
 regular_movement_of_regiments_desc: "There are some aspects of warfare with the steppe hordes that we cannot deny would be good for the military of Nizhny Novgorod. One of these aspects is that of swift movement across the steppe, something they have mastered and we are lagging behind on. If we can incorporate some of the easier to defeat hordes into our domain and utilize their military leadership in our own ranks, we could start to develop a stronger sense of direction and pace for when we move across these vast stretches of land."
 make_the_east_livable_and_likable: "Hard Work Toward Habitability"
 make_the_east_livable_and_likable_desc: "The steppe is by no means an easy place to settle down in. Sure there may be small villages and towns here and there, but mostly it is made of nomadic communities that have lived like this for centuries. What we can do as we steadily make way into the steppe is work toward tilling and changing the land over the decades so as to make it more livable and more capable of supporting farms and settled communities. It won't be an easy task for the peasants doing this, but we are willing to fund the efforts as the results will be worth it in just a couple generations."
 at_the_edge_of_russia: "At the Edge of the Rus"
 at_the_edge_of_russia_desc: "To some back in Novgorod, Tver, Poltosk, and other Russian cities, Nizhny Novgorod is at the edge of civilization as they know it. Their knowledge of the lands beyond our frontier are scarce and lacking, but perhaps that is for the best for us. Nizhny Novgorod has been founded and raised up in these border region conditions, next to the steppe and consistently at the front of hostilities between settled and nomadic states. Learning to govern both types of people is by no means an easy task, but who is more capable than we are in this regard? None, that is who."

 #Ryazan Ideas#
 burned_twice_but_still_alive: "Burnt to Ash; Risen from Ash"
 burned_twice_but_still_alive_desc: "We have been invaded on multiple occasions even before the Mongol hordes came through and ravaged our land. Whether it was from Vladimir-Suzdal in the north or Cuman hordes in the south, Ryazan knew very little peace in its history; this reached a new level of destruction though when Batu Khan invaded and devastated our capital in December of 1237. But even despite all of these hardships we have been through, the people of Ryazan carry on and righteously defend what is their own. They know to never give up without a fight, not even when the odds are stacked against them in every direction. Men and women alike are ready to serve until death in defense of our independence."
 ready_to_relocate_the_capital: "A Mobile Capital"
 ready_to_relocate_the_capital_desc: "In the past, when Ryazan was sacked and burned by invading forces, we have had to move our capital to a different nearby town and go through the process of relocating nobility, peasants, and even things like stacks of manuscripts and valuable materials. This sort of 'life-on-the-road' mentality that has seeped into Ryazan is what helps our people and our administration build up infrastructure and suitable towns into more viable centers of administration; and should Ryazan be invaded so terribly as it was before, we might just need to move our base of operations once more."
 vladimir_suzdals_courageous_resistance: "Courage from Vladimir-Suzdal"
 vladimir_suzdals_courageous_resistance_desc: "Even though the old Grand Duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal invaded us on multiple occasions, they were one of the main sources of power in the Rus that stood up to the Mongol hordes in various battles, losing time and time again. Despite these losses and prior bad blood, Ryazan at times fought with Vladimir-Suzdal in order to preserve the independence of Russian people. It is this courage and valiant attitude that we will strive to emulate as we move forward, fighting on even if there is no clear victory in sight."
 the_skirmishes_against_pronsk: "The Old Feud with Pronsk"
 the_skirmishes_against_pronsk_desc: "Ryazan's feud with the town of Pronsk is an age-old one that refuses to be settled in courts or in diplomatic meetings. Skirmishes and open combat have been common throughout our history shared history, but still Pronsk sees itself as independent of Ryazan's politics and influence. In time, we will end this pretentious little area of ours and secure it through military occupation if need be, and the various battles we've fought against Pronsk will be remembered fondly by our military."
 mongol_military_influences_on_ryazan: "The Cavalry Arm of the Rus"
 mongol_military_influences_on_ryazan_desc: "Being that we are perhaps the closest to the wide open steppe, Ryazan is more suited to fielding cavalry-based armies than other places like Moscow, Novgorod, Tver, or Smolensk. Taking what we can learn from our experience with the devastating Mongol hordes and other steppe khanates, Ryazan's military has the potential to become something of a dominant force in the Rus and along places like the Don River and the Lower Volga."
 ready_to_take_the_don: "Settle the Don River"
 ready_to_take_the_don_desc: "A near and dear to the people of Ryazan and the steppe people near us, the Don River is vital for a number of reasons: trade, map making, fresh water, and even fortification construction. If we of Ryazan can take hold of the majority of the Don River and settle it with our own towns and villages with protections via constructed fortifications, the power we wield will grow immensely!"
 steppe_contacts_for_ryazan: "Steppe Contacts toward Ryazan"
 steppe_contacts_for_ryazan_desc: "Increasingly we are being contacted by steppe hordes from the east who are curious at the development of Ryazan as a whole. Gone are the days where strong khanates like the Golden Horde or the Khanate of Kazan would threaten the lands of the Rus without end, so now we are looking forward toward this new era of tense but good cooperation and diplomatic relations. The better friends we are with these steppe states, the more cavalry will be available to us in general and we will perhaps be able to expand our influence to new heights across the vast and open stretches of land to our east."

 #Pskov Ideas#
 daumantas_give_us_strength: "Daumantas Give Pskov Strength!"
 daumantas_give_us_strength_desc: "Glory be to he who is known as Timothy in Christianity, but in Pskov is known as the great Daumantas! Arriving in 1266 and dying in 1299, Daumantas had a bloody history with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the point when he arrived in Pskov. He rose to power quickly in Pskov and led the Pskovian military to victory against Lithuanian forces by the Daugava River. His story streches for years after this great battle what with Novgorod even being unable to rein him in during his lifetime and it is undoubtedly a life history that will be told without end in Pskov. Let his legacy give us strength and valor so that we may live to see an independent future!"
 the_pskov_charter: "The Pskov Charter, Reaffirmed"
 the_pskov_charter_desc: "The Pskov Charter has been around since 1397, but it is not an unchanging document. With input from the veche and princely decrees, it has changed shape over the decades to become a staple part of our state and must be protected by all in the administration. Within the documentation, it protects private property (feudal matters included), court examination of land disputes, and it also issues regulations for trade relations (such as buying, selling, loaning, and hiring people for work)."
 bridge_to_europe_outpost_of_russia: "As a Bridge, and an Outpost"
 bridge_to_europe_outpost_of_russia_desc: "Pskov sees itself in an interesting position when it comes to international politics since we are both a bridge and an outpost (the former being when viewed by Russians and the latter when being viewed from the west). What this helps ensure though is that Pskov has plenty of lucrative trade chances with Scandinavians, Germans, Russians, and Balts. So long as we don't disturb international politics too much, this situation should continue on without much of a hassle."
 the_bridge_that_is_fought_over: "Taking the Brunt of Wars"
 the_bridge_that_is_fought_over_desc: "Trade is not the only thing that comes to the heart of Pskov, for war is quite common for our area as well. Danish incursions in Estonia right to our west, Rus states battling it out our east, and the Baltic realm being thrashed by Teutonic and Lithuanian forces alike; all of this makes for Pskov seeing a great amount of action and being viewed as a strategic location for many monarchs and commanders. Perhaps we can leverage this view on Pskov for the better and ally ourselves with some strong states to help protect us as these wars rage on."
 stone_wall_the_capital: "Protecting Pskov's Heart"
 stone_wall_the_capital_desc: "We are not a fragile state since we have been hardened by repeated wars, but we are not nearly as strong as neighboring states, that much is clear. As such we need to ensure that our defenses (especially the ones around our capital) are well built and numerous, even when it comes to layered walls. If we have to build two, three, or even four stone walls around our capital to keep it safe from desolation, then we will do it!"
 flowering_of_mixing_art_styles: "Artisans of Pskov"
 flowering_of_mixing_art_styles_desc: "It is thanks to our history, geographic location, and special attention to trade over making military invasions elsewhere that Pskov is become a true center of artistry in a variety of forms. Whether it is in new structures built with a blend of styles from east and west, or whether it is the growing population of icon-makers in Pskov, we know just how valuable our artisans are to the prosperity of the state. In time, these works of art and beauty will bring in more profitable business for us whilst also ensuring a lasting legacy for future generations."
 refusal_of_estates_in_favor_of_the_republic: "Affirmation of the Republic"
 refusal_of_estates_in_favor_of_the_republic_desc: "How far we have come is a sign of Pskov's effective way of governance and attention to its citizens. Other states around us find it necessary to rely on unruly nobles to handle affairs around their realm, but Pskov is truly following in the model of Novgorod and utilizing the veche and other tactics to give the people of land a rightful say in politics. We must not let these principles go, not ever, not so long as Pskov lives on."

 VOL_ideas_start: "Galicia-Volhynia Traditions"

 playing_christian_religious_politics: "Nothing Wrong with Two Faces"
 playing_christian_religious_politics_desc: "Pope Innocent IV had Daniel I of Galicia crowned as king of the Rus in 1245, yet still the lands he governed over remained firmly independent of the Holy See in terms of ecclesiastic matters. Eastern Orthodoxy was still the religion of the people despite this gesture of goodness from the Papacy in the west, so what does that mean for our own future? It means we can play off both Catholics and Orthodox clergy through delegations and careful internal political assertions."

 the_link_between_north_and_south_desc: "We occupy a very crucial piece of land that stretches between Ruthenia and Poland, so it is understandable that both Poles and Ruthenians and even Hungarians and Lithuanians would want our land for themselves. When we are not at war with any of these states, it would be wise for us to capitalize on the flowing trade in these transition towns and cities; they're lucrative and full of potential if they are protected with a firm military and a competent administration."
 composite_literature_making: "Many People; Many Literature Styles"
 composite_literature_making_desc: "We have in our lands people from all around us: Hungarians, Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, and of course, Russians. Not only this, but we are seeing new populations slowly arrive inside Galicia-Volhynia too, meaning that they will bring their traditions of literature with them. Encouraging this growth of book writing and book publishing will help all facets of our society and it will even help our administration become more attuned to new innovations that spread across Europe."
 routine_hostilities_on_all_sides: "The Web of Friends and Enemies"
 routine_hostilities_on_all_sides_desc: "Since the inception of Galicia-Volhynia into a single state under Roman the Great (1152-1205), we have been tangled up in a web of hostile and friendly relations that switch around from time to time. Playing off the Polish to our north, the Hungarians to our southwest, the Lithuanians to our northeast, and the Tatars to our southeast has been nothing short of tiring to those of Galicia-Volhynia and indeed holding this geographical region down is a test for any serious ruler. Perhaps in time though, when we have another Roman the Great on our throne, we can exert ourselves once more and strike at our enemies, asserting our old claims as true and valid."
 the_mistake_of_andrew_ii_and_lev_ii: "Assurances of Heirs"
 the_mistake_of_andrew_ii_and_lev_ii_desc: "The mistake of Leo II and Andrew II during their lifetimes that doomed Galicia-Volhynia completely was the fact that neither left an heir in place for the state! Sources disagree on how and where they died in 1323, but the fact that they did effectively left the state to be governed by boyars and also partitioned by those surrounding the state. As we look toward a new future in this ever changing world, we must find a concrete way to get new heirs and ensure that the dynasty of Galicia-Volhynia is never in danger of dying out completely. If this can be done, more faith can be put into the state and its administration from the people."
 variety_of_populations_of_the_nation: "Come One Come All!"
 variety_of_populations_of_the_nation_desc: "Just as we are engaging in a blooming of new literature that combines elements from a variety of different cultures, we should also be engaging in taking a regular census for our cities and also looking to recognize the various people of Galicia-Volhynia. If we cannot or will not accept certain portions of people who have come to our land seeking refuge or opportunity, then how do we expect to survive as a growing state that comes to encompass vast swathes of people?"
 the_red_is_rigthfully_ours: "End the Contention"
 the_red_is_rigthfully_ours_desc: "We have come far in our journey from being set free once more. Whilst we still face a variety of threats around us, Galicia-Volhynia can and should become stronger than it ever was prior to the Mongol invasions. Settling contentions on our borders, especially over the Cherven Cities, is what should be our main goal now since the Polish, Lithuanians, and Hungarians are starting to realize that they can no longer push us around like they used to. It is time to play our hand!"

 #Golden Horde Ideas#
 revitalized_with_golden_vigor: "Revived, Renewed, and Ready"
 revitalized_with_golden_vigor_desc: "After the reign of Jani Beg ended in 1357, a steep decline took hold of the Golden Horde and civil strife consumed all parts of the administration. Whilst Tokhtamysh brought back some stability to the Golden Horde from 1381 to 1395, the precedent was set that unrest and breaking away from central authority was going to continue without end. These times of breaking down and being unable to control politics must be rectified if we are ever to become as strong as we once were; we must learn to control how succession works, how feuds are handled, and how politics stretching from town to town and region to region are handled. Our ancestors may not have been able to do this, but we certainly can."
 a_failed_past_for_a_brighter_future: "Stains in our Golden Past"
 a_failed_past_for_a_brighter_future_desc: "The old style of deciding politics and having sons or brothers flee to neighboring lands to ask support to retake the throne is something that was disastrous for our past khans. The latter part of the 1300s is rife with examples of how our khans could not keep a firm grip over things, but we are better than them in more ways than just one. Our borders are becoming more concrete, our administration is becoming more streamlined, and how we integrate new people into the lands of the Golden Horde is following in line with how those of the great Mongol Empire used to. Soon, none will be able to stop our advances in any direction."
 sweeping_cavalry_formations: "The Unleashed and Unbound Horde"
 sweeping_cavalry_formations_desc: "The resurgence of the Golden Horde is an alarming thing to many in Europe for a variety of reasons, but perhaps the most feared reason is that of our mighty cavalry armies. Even if we must strive to use gunpowder siege weapons alongside muskets, the military of the Golden Horde has its emphasis on what has carried its nomadic ancestors through the ages: cavalry. Few if any states around us can even come close to matching our mastery of cavalry tactics and that will be to our distinct advantage."
 what_sarai_imposes_on_us: "Sarai Berke, Emulated"
 what_sarai_imposes_on_us_desc: "New Sarai, or, as we call it 'Sarai Berke' was the heart of the Golden Horde in the past, serving as a trade hub and a political center in the steppe that could effectively govern a great amount of land in the hands of the right people. Though it has fallen from grace due to negligence and disruptions in politics throughout the decades, we can and will build it up once more. Not only this, but we will emulate its majesty and might in our other largest cities where we find trade and wealth thriving."
 sedentary_life_calls_to_us: "Settle the Land; Settle for the Future"
 sedentary_life_calls_to_us_desc: "In the days of old, Sarai Berke helped solidify the notion to many nomadic folks that settled life was the way forward. It called to many in the Golden Horde's administration for them to settle down and to cultivate a more rigid and robust state that could expand development internally, but unfortunately not everyone saw it this way and thus, diverging views sparked tension over time. At least today the facts of the matter are more clear than ever to the Golden Horde viziers and commanders: settled life is simply what will become the standard for more and more people inside its borders."
 islam_but_not_completely: "Steppe Version of Islam"
 islam_but_not_completely_desc: "Though the introduction of Islam to the Golden Horde was somewhat violent thanks to Oz Beg Khan killing Jochid princes and Buddhist lamas that opposed his adoption of Islam, it helped gather support across the state for his campaigns against the Ilkhanate in 1319, 1325, and 1335. After this adoption of Islam though, it wasn't enforced heavily through imams and strict legalist approaches; not even alcohol was banned by the Golden Horde back then. Just as it was back then, we too will take this relaxed approach to Islam as a state religion; we will not enforce it as heavily as some other states do, and we will not take every single doctrine of Islam to heart. Prosperity can be had even with kafirs and infidels."
 usage_of_the_yam_system_again: "Rekindle the Yam System"
 usage_of_the_yam_system_again_desc: "Relay stations for messengers, that is in essence what the old yam system was. It allowed for armies, communication, civilians, and officials to travel to and from places efficiently so that the administration could keep up with the pace of conquests going outward from the Mongol Empire. We of the Golden Horde would be fools not to use such a system again for the vast stretches of land we have across the steppe; we could even improve parts of it when and where see fit, just so long as the funding is available."

 #Aragonese Ideas#
 legacy_of_the_catalan_company: "Legacy of the Catalan Company"
 legacy_of_the_catalan_company_desc: "Mercenaries, an age-old concept that has graced the bloody fields of battle for generations upon generations. For us of Aragon, the Catalan Company had a great deal of influence on our rise as they were formed because of almogavar veterans that were unemployed after the War of the Sicilian Vespers. They did not serve us at every single point, but they left us of Aragon a true legacy to live up to in terms of hiring and continuing alongside mercenaries in general. Whenever we need an extra bit of impact in a war of any kind, we can always pay for a bit more backing."
 western_mediterranean_dominance: "Western Mediterranean Dominance"
 western_mediterranean_dominance_desc: "Situated as we are and with how influential we have been over places like Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and especially Iberian coasts in the east, we stand to benefit from focusing greatly on our naval prowess so that we can dominate the sea for trade purposes. Of course others will contest our dominance in this part of the Mediterranean, but if we employ capabal sailors with strong ship designs, few will be able to actually dethrone us from where we sit as holder of the 'Consulate of the Sea'."
 learn_from_the_union_of_aragon: "Lessons from the Union of Aragon"
 learn_from_the_union_of_aragon_desc: "The late 1200s saw perhaps the greatest devolution in crown authority for Aragon as a whole. The Union of Aragon was formed as a result of Peter III's annexation of Sicily and Pope Martin IV taking firm action against him, leading to a great deal of chaos that included the nobles of the land rising up and forcing his successor, Alfonso III, to accept conditions that let lesser nobles take part in the traditional power structure of the Crown of Aragon. It was disastrous and let the state lapse further and further downward, something we wish to never see again for the good of all of Aragon. If this means we have to cut down the power of the nobles in a variety of ways and through various laws, then we will do so and seek to empower the crown altogether."
 core_kingdoms_into_one_crown: "Core Kingdoms, One Crown"
 core_kingdoms_into_one_crown_desc: "We are not a singular kingdom in reality. Under the Crown of Aragon there are constituent kingdoms that form our basis of power, some of them being: The Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and of course, the Kingdom of Aragon itself. The more we can tie these kingdoms into one nice and neat power structure under one crown, the more secure our people will feel no matter where they are."
 petty_kingdoms_for_economic_gain: "Petty Crowns"
 petty_kingdoms_for_economic_gain_desc: "Whilst we have core kingdoms in Iberia and such, Aragon is not without its need for lesser crowns beneath it in places such as the Italian Peninsula. Formalizing the obligations they have to the Crown of Aragon and ensuring that they serve our economic interests instead of others is what will be the focus of them, and if the Papacy or some other force seeks to break them away from us, we will retaliate with the utmost force from the shores of Iberia and all other lands we hold."
 utiliz_the_fueros_in_conquest: "Fueros?"
 utiliz_the_fueros_in_conquest_desc: "To govern local life, especially in recently conquered land, is something that is very hard to do in any state. A strong and sound administration alongside a ready and willing military force is key to locking local places down, yet giving them some autonomy and formalizing local laws is also needed so as to keep them productive and at least somewhat happy. That is where the fueros of Aragon come into play as we have used them before when conquering lands in Iberia, but they were less formalized than what we truly want. Making it an ongoing process to keep the fueros in a state of refinement so that local communities are not suppressed will integrate people to a much faster degree into our state."
 aragonese_protectionism: "Instill Protectionism"
 aragonese_protectionism_desc: "Being flexible on our diplomacy and our trade policy is key to maintaining the prominence of Aragon in Europe, but is it enough? Mercantile matters are increasingly becoming the focus of our administration since we can make a great deal of money off of the flow of trade which is why many in our court are suggesting we instill some sort of protectionism for Aragonese lands as a whole. It would be a dangerous experiment sure since it could mess with how much income we see from trade overall, but it could also grant us untold amounts of influence."

 #Castilian Ideas#
 from_border_region_to_kingdom: "The Past of Castile"
 from_border_region_to_kingdom_desc: "Origins can feel like distant memories to many, but for us of Castile, they are foundations on which we build our current reputation and might off of. Castile's origins lay in it being originally a militarized border region between the Kingdom of Asturias and the Muslims of al-Andalus, but it was the work of Fernan Gonzalez that paved the way for Castile to become a power to rival that of Leon later on. We must never forget these turbulent yet fruitful years of our foundation, not when we still have enemies in many directions to contend with."
 dynastic_bickering_remnants: "Castile's Dynastic Interests"
 dynastic_bickering_remnants_desc: "Inside of Castile and outside throughout Europe, dynastic fluctuations are impacting the great states of Europe without end. Even when we think we're safe, we can see the minor dynasties inside Castile moving their metaphorical chess pieces around so that they might undermine our authority or gain more power for themselves. Instead of looking to crush these minor dynasties outright and trying to smite down any sort of local authority figures, we should work with them and gain their trust and loyalty. The more we can placate them into a soft and submissive stance, the better off we will be internally and externally."
 utilize_the_religious_orders: "The Orders of Calatrava, Alcantara, and Santiago"
 utilize_the_religious_orders_desc: "The rise of the Castile and its ever faithful monarchs throughout the centuries has meant that Christian holy orders were bound to rise up as well. The Order of Calatrava (founded in 1164), the Order of Alcantara (founded in 1166), and the Order of Santiago (founded in about 1170) all play minor but crucial roles in the administration of Castilian land and the enforcement of religious matters across our land. Though they are not quite an inquisition of sorts, they routinely prove to be useful for our religious efforts, especially when we are at war with heretics and heathens alike."
 ordained_to_expand: "By God's Will!"
 ordained_to_expand_desc: "Some may not see us as being chosen by God or chosen by the Holy See to expand overseas and across to different places of the world, but we do not need this recognition from other European monarchs and states. Castile's own royalty and administration know full well that Christians both near and far approve of our expansion both near and far; getting special approval from the Holy See is merely the official seal on things that will make the point stick even harder."
 local_councils_of_cabildos: "Cabildos of Castile"
 local_councils_of_cabildos_desc: "In these new lands that we conquer and colonize, we must work toward establishing a sort of local administration that can organize matters so that officials of higher status can administrate things properly. Forming these sorts of 'cabildos' in freshly taken lands will help satiate things for the time being, but we should always be on the lookout for how we can improve them for the future."
 enforcement_of_christian_supremacy: "All for the Church; Nothing outside of the Church"
 enforcement_of_christian_supremacy_desc: "If it isn't bad enough that the rest of Europe outside of Iberia seems to be in the midst of religious civil war, we must also contend with the fact that some of these heretics think that Iberia is place where their ideas might be welcome! This simply cannot stand and we will work to enforce religious order in Castile via something not many would expect out of us, considering we already holy orders at the ready: An inquisition! And one that officially backed by the Castilian administration at that! Through this religious arm of ours, we will be able to maintain absolute Christian authority in these lands of ours."
 settle_a_formal_capital: "Which Capital of Castile?"
 settle_a_formal_capital_desc: "Since Castile's founding, it might be embarrassing to say but... We haven't had a formal capital in a long time. Traditionally the capital of Castile has been wherever the king chose to stay at; if he chose to stay in Madrid, Toledo, or Burgos, the cortes was there and so was the capital. Since we are growing larger than ever before and we are starting to expand several parts of our administration to handle the vast stretches of land we hold, it would be wise to settle down a formal capital for ourselves so that administrative matters can be more streamlined and we don't have to worry about travel issues and having to move suddenly if the current monarch suddenly dies."

 #Ashikaga Ideas#
 ashikaga_takauijis_legacy: "Legacy of Ashikaga Takauji"
 ashikaga_takauijis_legacy_desc: "Male descendant of the Seiwa Genji line and destroyer of the Kamakura Shogunate, Ashikaga Takauji was originally a general of the Kamakura Shogunate. He served valiantly in the Genko War of 1331, but later on he helped banish Emperor Go-Daigo and seize Kyoto itself after becoming disillusioned with the Kamakura Shogunate. After taking Kamakura (the city) itself, he established the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1336 and increasingly earned respect and prestige for the shogunate during his lifetime. Though his life is long gone by now, we still channel much of his prowess in diplomacy and military in order to garner favorable support from our subordinates."
 reduction_of_imperial_power: "Imperial Threats No More!"
 reduction_of_imperial_power_desc: "We lack the established land holdings that the Kamakura Shogunate did before us, yet our base of power is set up in Kyoto itself instead of elsewhere so that we can ensure there is very little the imperial court itself can do against us. With the emperor weakened and no longer a threat to the Ashikaga Shogunate in general, we can pursue other prospects for our military-oriented administration and know that we are safe from ever breaking down into a period akin to the Nanboku-cho Period."
 higashiyama_and_kano_painting: "Higashiyama Culture & Kano Paintings"
 higashiyama_and_kano_painting_desc: "The earlier style of Kitayama Culture is fading away and the new wave of Zen Buddhist aesthetics is coming upon our land. Emphasizing aspects like chado (the tea ceremony), ikebana (flower arranging), Noh drama, and sumi-e ink painting, this new era of Higashiyama Culture alongside the emerging Kano school of painting will help give new cultural life to the shogunate whilst also attracting a great deal of artisans from all walks of life."
 shugo_and_bugyo_reining_in: "The Shugo and Bugyo Positions"
 shugo_and_bugyo_reining_in_desc: "From positions of local authority to provincial governors themselves, these bugyo and shugo positions of power have been a source of constant tension inside the Ashikaga Shogunate. Time and time again our shoguns have had resources siphoned away by these local authorities who would rather serve their own purposes than that which the shogunate desires. As each one dies out or becomes a target of corruption, we should replace them with officials that stem from the Ashikaga Clan or those from our cadet branches who are actually loyal to Kyoto."
 the_five_mountain_system_strengthened: "The Five Mountain System"
 the_five_mountain_system_strengthened_desc: "The Five Mountain System is a system of Buddhist temples in Kyoto and Kamakura (five in each for a total of ten) that greatly help in administrating the land we directly control. From Tenryu-ji to Jomyo-ji, these temples have disciplined and skilled monks that aid in the running of Ashikaga affairs whilst also helping keep the clan itself together. With these temples and our continual patronage toward the Rinzai school of Buddhism that they follow, we will be able to properly keep our personal land in check."
 organizing_the_hokoshu_and_bugyoshu: "Hokoshu & Bugyoshu Reformation"
 organizing_the_hokoshu_and_bugyoshu_desc: "Military officials loyal directly to the Ashikaga Shogunate itself, these are the Hokoshu; magistrates and officials appointed directly by the Ashikaga Clan, these are the bugyoshu. For too long these positions have been few in number and lacking in their discipline, meaning that effective control over local affairs in our own land and the guarding of our land from invaders has been lacking to a great degree. Instituting a series of reforms to enlargen these posts with a greater selection of strong-willed and skillful people will open the doors to more functional Ashikaga domains."
 build_upon_shikimoku_and_goseibai_shikimoku: "Shikimoku and Goseibai-Shikimoku Revisions"
 build_upon_shikimoku_and_goseibai_shikimoku_desc: "In the beginning of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Ashikaga Takauji put forth the Kenmu Shikimoku and the Goseibai-Shikimoku as law codes to govern the land of the new shogunate. Being largely based in the Kamakura Shogunate's era of governance, these law codes are becoming more and more outdated with each passing year. Gathering a proper council of sorts to pass new legislation with regards to reforming these old law codes, or perhaps even drawing up new law codes in general, could breathe new life into our administration for the coming generations."

 #Punjab Ideas#
 five_rivers_of_the_great_indus: "Five Rivers into One Indus"
 five_rivers_of_the_great_indus_desc: "There are five rivers in the north that flow into one main heart that is the Indus River, going southward and giving fresh irrigation to a variety of people and communities that have thrived here for centuries without end. Punjab can be said to be where the Indus River starts its journey, and it is here that some of the most valuable lands by the Indus River are found. Thus, we will have an easier time developing them upward into something resembling an urbanized region as we go on."
 gateway_to_bharat_and_iran: "Into and Out of Punjab"
 gateway_to_bharat_and_iran_desc: "Punjab is a place of movements into and out of Bharat's northwestern sector. Being that it is lucrative for development, trade routes, and military strategies from various states in general, it would be wise to capitalize on these alluring aspects of our region. We can take in new ideas from afar and bolster our own revenue stream if we simply play our cards right in the various shifts of international politics."
 honest_work_of_sufi_saints: "Through Spiritual Works"
 honest_work_of_sufi_saints_desc: "Our proximity to Iranian lands has been met with hostilities at times, yet it has also allowed for a great deal of sufi saints to make their way into Punjab. These various sufis are hailed by many locals as hard workers, benevolent individuals, and graciously pious in their ways despite whatever political shifts happened above. Despite how Punjab has developed around Sikhism today, we should still give honor and thanks to the sufis of the past and present as the work they do is still very key to having Punjab stay together."
 cultivate_this_granary_of_bharat: "'Granary of Bharat'"
 cultivate_this_granary_of_bharat_desc: "Various foreigners and merchants have given the name 'granary of Bharat' to the Punjab region and that isn't without merit; we do produce a great amount of crops every single year and it was helps us influence the trade routes around us. If we can get the farmers and their respective plots of land to use more innovative irrigation methods whilst we of the administration reform how we deal out plots of land as a whole, we will be able to ensure that the production of various goods in Punjabi lands is never in doubt."
 militant_sikh_communities_in_use: "Rise of Militancy"
 militant_sikh_communities_in_use_desc: "Firearms, centralization, and even religious tensions growing ever more intricate, all of these factors and more play a role in how Punjab's communities are developing as a whole. We are seeing widespread militant ideas coming to the attention of our administration and often times skirmishes in rural areas near foreign borders with Punjab are taken care of by these militant communities instead of our actual regiments of soldiers. We need to reach out and work with these militant Punjabis so as to prevent unintended future conflicts and to bolster our own military ranks."
 centralization_instead_of_confederacy: "Common Causes and Common Customs"
 centralization_instead_of_confederacy_desc: "Once we have established a firm grasp on the militant locals and religious matters inside Punjab, making these various Punjabi people and their neighboring cultures see eye-to-eye is something that will take a very long time. Yet it is a project spanning generations of time that we of Punjab are willing to undertake so that we can have a formalized administration without the need for harsh reprisals or increasingly shady ties through advisors and royal families."
 to_defend_sikhism_is_to_defend_punjab: "Defenders of Sikhism; Defenders of Punjab"
 to_defend_sikhism_is_to_defend_punjab_desc: "It has never been in doubt that Sikhism is what underpins much of the Punjabi unity we enjoy today. It is a small religious movement compared to the pious giant that is Islam and the wise titan that is Hinduism, but it is not without its vehement supporters and ardent defenders. Going forward, Sikhism will continue to play a central role in Punjabi affairs both on a local and administrative level, and the Sikh warriors that vow to defend the faith will be welcomed into Punjabi military ranks as well. Their discipline is not just for the movement founded by Guru Nanak, it is for all of Punjab."

 #Afghanistan Ideas#
 loya_jirga_of_ages_past:  "Loya Jirga"
 loya_jirga_of_ages_past_desc: "Within our tribal system of loyalties and hierarchy, the loya jirga is a special assembly convened in the case of a sudden and unexpected change in governance (death, rebellion, code of laws being changed, etc.). Through consulting the loya jirga regularly when we know there is a major shift in governance happening, we will secure a much stronger base of loyalty amongst our various people as they know intrinsically that such an assembly of the people is needed in order to properly ordain that which rules the Pashtun people."
 pashtunwali_stays_true: "The Code of Life: Pashtunwali"
 pashtunwali_stays_true_desc: "What has been the main part of our way of life for centuries upon centuries now is something that all Iranians should look to for guidance to some degree. Pashtunwali stipulates four main principles: Hospitality, Asylum, Justice, and Revenge. There are other facets of Pashtunwali that we adhere to like arbitration and respect, yet those first four are the foundational principles that we should go by. And when an invader seeks to do us wrong by tarnishing our land and our state, we will enact righteous justice and revenge upon them."
 practice_hit_and_run_in_the_hindu_kush: "Hit-and-Run!"
 practice_hit_and_run_in_the_hindu_kush_desc: "We cannot rely on large standing armies full of professional soldiers; our land and our state is simply not built for such measures. What we are much more inclined to do is to levy troops from various tribes for battle and call upon tribal mercenaries when we can for extra support, and what both groups tend to specialize in is hit-and-run tactics. The introduction of firearms has made doing such hit-and-run maneuvers much easier, thus allowing our military forces to strike quicker and more deadly blows against the enemy."
 ghulams_spread_throughout: "Ghulams Far and Wide"
 ghulams_spread_throughout_desc: "They are stretched far across our homeland and beyond, serving as mercenaries or slave-soldiers for various political entities who can give them money, aid, and work; they are the ghulams. Pashtun leaders are no stranger to ghulams as they have become integral to making sure that the heartland of the Pashtun people stays safe, and integrating them bit by bit into our growing Pashtun state will help reduce the cost of hiring them for future campaigns."
 internal_disputes_without_end: "Never Ending Issues"
 internal_disputes_without_end_desc: "Despite what we do to cultivate a strong state for the Pashtun people, tribal feuds and disloyal locals continue to plague our administration. Often times we have tried to reason with these tribes of our land since they are also Pashtun most of the time, but we have seen quite a few of these attempts fall through and result in outright violent uprisings against us. Such revolts in the future will be seen as enemies of the state entirely and we will use every resource available to us to rein in these misguided fools."
 remember_to_consult_the_tribal_council: "Never Forget the Origins"
 remember_to_consult_the_tribal_council_desc: "What must never be forgotten as time goes on is to consult the tribal council itself that is central to whatever Pashtun state rules over the land, for it is from the tribal council that partly where the administration derives its power from. By including the tribal council on various decisions from economic policies to trade deals and military spending, the Pashtun people will know that they are being listened to in full."
 masterful_defensive_plays: "The Hindu Kush Defense"
 masterful_defensive_plays_desc: "We do not live where it is easy to thrive and succeed, but rather where life is tested to its very limits with each passing generation. Some valleys are rife with life and opportunity, yes, but most places in the Hindu Kush mountains are hard to traverse, full of blazing heat, thin air, and sometimes even biting cold. Such conditions will make our defensive positions in the Hindu Kush mountains all the more favorable, and enemy seeking to root out the Pashtun people will need to shed more blood than they ever thought possible in order to do so."

 the_spread_of_qizilbash: "To Tame the Qizilbash"
 the_spread_of_qizilbash_desc: "The spread of Shiite Islam throughout Mesopotamia and Iran has had a great amount of influence on not only politics across the land, but also on the local people who arm themselves and fight for various dynasties. Coming into our service as of late are the so-called 'Qizilbash' who are mainly Turkoman in origin and Shiite in religion; their weapons lent to the various sufi orders of the land have helped them become prominent forces all throughout Iran. Utilizing their military prowess throughout our land is what can and will propel us further than ever before, yet we must be wary of how influential they truly are as our politics evolve."
 pahlevani_and_zourkhaneh: "Pahlevani and Zourkhaneh"
 pahlevani_and_zourkhaneh_desc: "Iranian wrestling and various forms of close combat have had a place in Iranian culture for centuries upon centuries; even the invasion of Arabs in 637 could not stop Iranian people from practicing this sort of martial training despite the targeting of places where Iranians would practice in private. Though it has changed quite a bit as of today with Islamic elements being now integral to the practices of pahlevani inside our many zourkhaneh (translated as 'houses of strength'), these various forms of strength training for military and our civilians is what will help sustain our martial skill as time goes on."
 details_within_evolving_archiecture: "The State Evolves with its Style"
 details_within_evolving_archiecture_desc: "There is no denying that as the Iranian people continue to thrive and take in new ideas from every direction, changes in politics and philosophy will come about that reflect the changes on the societal level. Yet, it is not just the intangible that changes as we Iranians do, but it is also the tangible elements of architecture that change too. Our mosques and gardens utilize local materials and local traditions to help give the structure a uniquely blended style, adding to the flourishing culture across all of Iran. Consequently, this usage of local materials and traditions also cuts down on the expenses we need to use for taking on such ambitious building projects."

 per_edge_defense_instead_of_inner_defense: "Defenses at our Edges"
 per_edge_defense_instead_of_inner_defense_desc: "The mountains of Iran are not invincible; the Arab invasion of 637 proved that fact to us. Still, they are a great natural barrier to invaders coming through, and the edges of our state are at a far greater risk of enemy invasion than the heart of our land in cities like Tehran and Isfahan. Establishing a stronger presence in these far territories of ours and keeping the locals in these far reaches under a closer watch will help keep our state alert and ready in the future."
 per_the_growth_of_carpet_making: "Unmatched Carpet Quality"
 per_the_growth_of_carpet_making_desc: "The weaving of carpets has been in Iranian history for generations as we all know, but we are now witnessing perhaps one of the greatest explosions in creativity for the art of carpet weaving. New patterns include carpets with spiral/tendril designs, floral ornaments, the depiction of flowers and animals, and some even achieve a mirrored design for an added layer of beauty. Truly these works of art are going to be sold for great amounts and this streamlining of the carpet making process is going to ensure that our economic prospects are never in doubt for the future."
 per_gholams_tofangchis_shahsevans_and_artillery: "Gholams, Tofangchis, Shahsevans, and Tupchi"
 per_gholams_tofangchis_shahsevans_and_artillery_desc: "We have a great amount of Christians from the Caucuses inside our state and they have proven to be useful as a special military branch called the 'gholam', but we must be wary of how they influence our state politics across generations. If we create other branches to go alongside the gholam, then we will be able to balance things out politically and also incorporate more gunpowder weapons into our military. Three other main branches can and will be put forth: the Shahsevans (friends of the king), the Tofangchis (musketeers), and the Tupchi (artillery-men); through these four branches, we will become a truly modern military power."
 per_safe_travels_and_safe_visits: "Travel in Peace"
 per_safe_travels_and_safe_visits_desc: "Throughout the lands of Arabia, Anatolia, the Levant, and Iran too, the various caravanserais make it so that people can travel for long stretches and make periodic stops to trade goods, get food and water, and also identify where exactly they are in the region. Those of our land, however, are larger in scope and placed in strategic locations across our lands alongside guards who collect road tolls so that traders and visitors passing through have an easier time getting from place to place in peace. It can be said that if one ensures the safety of traders and travellers throughout their land, prosperity in turn is also ensured."

 lur_kurdish_allies: "Ally the Tribes"
 lur_kurdish_allies_desc: "To our west in Mesopotamia, we see a variety of changes taking place over time. Kurdish tribes migrate, Arabian bands of people move around, and even Turkic people move through and sometimes settle down. What we observe regularly though is the increasing presence of Kurdish tribes in the region thanks to us securing the heartland of Iran to the east of Mesopotamia. If we can reliably ally these Kurdish tribes and bring them closer to our administration, we will have a great source of devoted fighters for our future conflicts, especially in western areas like the Levant and Arabia."
 lur_rigid_defensive_stance: "Staunch Iranian Defenses"
 lur_rigid_defensive_stance_desc: "The gates into Iranian heartland are marked by high mountains and narrow paths that snake through the elevated slopes and passages. If one is to truly invade Iranian cities like Isfahan and Tehran, they will need to break through these natural gates of stone that nature has put forth for us. It is in this grand defensive nature that we can find refuge in the most dire times."
 lur_diminshed_religious_rigidity: "Fluidity in Religious Practice"
 lur_diminshed_religious_rigidity_desc: "We can learn much from the more spaced out people of Iran such as the Lurs. For far too long now there has been a sense of strict religiosity across the lands from Tabriz to Herat; it causes divides and struggles between muftis, imams, and whole communities that could otherwise be avoided entirely if a more practical approach to religion was taken. As we come to power in future decades, we will take steps to emphasize local practices and traditions with regards to religion so as to dampen the flames of religious zealotry in our land. If we can garner the loyalty of our own faithful people regardless of their exact theology, then we will be able to bend the greater religious institutions to our own will."
 lur_open_to_different_politics: "Politics of a Different Sort"
 lur_open_to_different_politics_desc: "Being that Iran has a variety of different Iranian branches of people encompassing its greatest cities and its halls of power, it would seem natural that different politics arise in the various areas under our authority. Indeed this is what we see as some places retain a tribal hierarchy and some places retain a much more theocratic hierarchy. Learning to adapt these politics toward our central administration and meeting the various people half way with regards to what can and should be done for them will help bring a sense of peace and stability to our lands."

 maz_cradle_of_iranian_agriculture: "Emphasize Iranian Agriculture"
 maz_cradle_of_iranian_agriculture_desc: "Many think of the land of the Iranian people as deficient in agriculuture and food production, but those people do not know about the lucrative lands at the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. These lands are havens for farmers and land owners alike as they produce some of the most valuable crops in all of our land, all whilst remaining productive at regular intervals year after year. Cultivating this region further with new technologies will only serve to bolster our grain reserves and food markets."
 maz_dabuyid_memories: "Dabuyid Descendant Memories"
 maz_dabuyid_memories_desc: "The transition out of the Sassanian Empire and into the era of Islam for Iranian people was one rife with chaos and instability. For those of the north, the Dabuyids and their descendant dynasties that were the Qarinvandids and Bavandids resisted the invasion of Muslims for generations before finally losing it all in their revolt agianst the Abbasid Caliphate around 783. Despite their losses and the fading grandeur of the Dabuyid descendants, we still revere the efforts of these noble lineages through tombs and monuments alike. Recognizing the greatness of our own past in recent times will ensure the populace that we are not ignorant of their extensive history."
 maz_caspian_trade_routes: "Look to the North"
 maz_caspian_trade_routes_desc: "Trade in the southern reaches of what is traditionally held as Iranian land is becoming harder and harder to profit from since Arabian tribes and foreign powers are making life for traders less than lucrative. In the north, though, we have untapped potential in trade routes across the Caspian Sea. Building a few more ports and sustaining a few more docks on what we control of the Caspian Sea could land us some very prosperous trade deals compared to what we can obtain in the south."
 maz_old_autonomous_tributary_status: "Knowledge of Subject Obligations"
 maz_old_autonomous_tributary_status_desc: "Though the descendants of the Dabuyids were subjugated by the Abbasid Caliphate, the caliphs neglected to truly make the lands of the Qarinvandids and Bavandids subjects of the caliphate; instead the lands were almost completely autonomous and pledged fealty to the caliphate in name only for generations without end. It is this kind of fully autonomous subject-overlord relationship that we must overcome in the future if we are to cultivate stronger diplomatic and administrative influence. We will be unlike the Abbasid Caliphate of the past as they tried to rein in Iranian lands; we will rectify what subject-overlord contracts we must to ensure we get what belongs to us."

 kur_independent_kurdish_fighting_experiences: "Complex Battle Memories"
 kur_independent_kurdish_fighting_experiences_desc: "From the Shaddadids to the Marwanids, and from the Hasanwayhids to the Ayyubids, Kurdish people and indeed the western edge of Iranian people in general have cultivated great amounts of influence in places across the Islamic world, but the light of these western expansions has been halted for a great amount of time now. Still, the memories of intense warfare and struggles for power remain in the various tribes and groups of Iranian people in the west; we would do well to harness their might in the form of an expanded military wing focused on securing and expanding into places like the Levant, Arabia, and Egypt."
 kur_various_interpretations_of_religion: "Religious Interpretations Spread"
 kur_various_interpretations_of_religion_desc: "The way various people of our land interpret theology, philosophy, and even morale values themselves is subject to change depending on where one goes. In some places, Shiite Islam under a certain school of jurisprudence may reign supreme; in others, Yazidi beliefs permeate the scattered people of the land; and yet in still other places, Christianity is spread alongside Islamic and Jewish beliefs. Recognizing and attempting a policy of cooperation with these various religious communities that do not follow what our state holds as true can and will lead us to greener pastures in the future, but we cannot falter in this effort for unity and recognition."
 kur_the_writing_of_old_stories: "Old Tales, Materialized"
 kur_the_writing_of_old_stories_desc: "So many people of Iranian descent have stories passed down to them from generation to generation, but where can these stories be found if say, a Kurdish person wished to learn about a story from a Baluchi person? Currently there is no place to learn such stories, but that will soon change! We will undertake an effort to start writing down these legends and myths of old into tomes and books so that future generations may read them without trouble, and so that the memories of ancestors can be preserved despite the loss of elders over time."
 kur_refine_the_handicrafts: "Iranian Wares Refined"
 kur_refine_the_handicrafts_desc: "Whilst we are experts in crafting certain objects and goods for trade purposes, we can get complacent in this lofty position of artistic flourishing. We should work toward patronizing more artisans and looking toward new ways of making certain goods that we are known for making so that we can continue to be on top of the world in terms of valued commodities. From new ways to refine wood to new methods of securing dyes from plants, all of it will go toward bolstering our expertise in artisan goods."

 kho_the_emirs_put_to_work: "Record Keeping & Internal Dynasties"
 kho_the_emirs_put_to_work_desc: "The lands of the Iranian people have a long history of internal dynasties of nobles and rulers, some of which have died out as the generations passed them by. Still though, we see several dynasties that rule parts of our land that can trace their ancestry all the way back to the times of the Abbasid Caliphate and before! Truly these families deserve a great degree of attention and respect, but they also deserve a great amount of work to keep them from usurping our hold on power. With the great dynasties inside our realm under lock-and-key, we shall be all the more centralized as time goes on."
 kho_distribute_forces_evenly: "Four Directions, Four Paths"
 kho_distribute_forces_evenly_desc: "Iranian land is but an island surrounded by paths of conquest and invasion, is it not? Westward is the lands of Anatolia and the Levant; southward is the land of the Arabs; northward is home to the herders of the steppe; and eastward is the gateway toward Hindustan itself. Maintaining our presence on all four fronts is going to require a serious amount of logistal support and road building, both of which we Iranians are adept at working toward should internal stability grace our administration."
 kho_muftis_imams_and_sufis_of_iran: "Sufi Orders & Foreign Patrons"
 kho_muftis_imams_and_sufis_of_iran_desc: "Religious figures in Iranian history are widespread and Islam's interesting history with Iranian people over the generations has given birth to a myriad of interpretations and schools of thought. The sufi orders in particular are perhaps some of the most well known parts of our Islamic history. From the Chishti Order to the Ni'matullahi Order, and from the Shattari Order to the Safaviyya Order, they have followers all across our land and beyond, particularly in the lands to our east in the subcontinent of Hindustan. Wealthy patrons from there including sultans and nawabs alike fund the sufi orders of our land via patronage for sufi members to visit and settle down, thus invigorating the religiosity of our state even more."
 kho_cross_continent_traders: "Lucrative Trade of Iranian Land"
 kho_cross_continent_traders_desc: "With our religious fervor rising, our affinity for stable income rises as well. The stability brought forth by our state in recent times has given rise to a rising amount of traders coming from the east and west, meaning we are gaining influence in both directions with regards to influence. If we can build more roads and keep our lands free from devastation in future decades, we will likely never run low on wealth in general, nor will we ever see an end to our growing influence."

 afg_the_four_tribes_that_dominate: "The Sarbani, Bettani, Gharghashti, and the Karlani"
 afg_the_four_tribes_that_dominate_desc: "Within the lands of the Hindu Kush and the general region that is known for harboring Pashtun tribes, there are four tribal confederacies that dominate politics: The Sarbani, Bettani, the Gharghashti, and the Karlani. Despite them having feuds and differences that broke down relations in the past, we have been able to resolve a great many of them since our unification into a single state, meaning we can recruit intellectuals and well read individuals from each group. So long as we continue to respect their traditions and their highest ranking people, we will have their support."
 afg_pashtunwali: "The Code of Life: Pashtunwali"
 afg_pashtunwali_desc: "What has been the main part of our way of life for centuries upon centuries now is something that all Iranians should look to for guidance to some degree. Pashtunwali stipulates four main principles: Hospitality, Asylum, Justice, and Revenge. There are other facets of Pashtunwali that we adhere to like arbitration and respect, yet those first four are the foundational principles that we should go by. And when an invader seeks to do us wrong by tarnishing our land and our state, we will enact righteous justice and revenge upon them."
 afg_poetry_and_literature_of_iran: "Upbringing of Iranian Literature"
 afg_poetry_and_literature_of_iran_desc: "As we learn about new ideas and innovations from far off lands, they become integral to both rural and urban parts of Iranian society. Not even the remote places in the Hindu Kush are safe from the coming tide of new assets and commodities, yet what is done with them by the writers and poets of our land is what will help these changes last forever. Encouraging the writing and copying of various Iranian books and manuscripts so that more may learn about various fields of study like agriculture, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy will be key in solidifying our place in the world."
 afg_a_prepared_empire: "Establish Iranian Dominance"
 afg_a_prepared_empire_desc: "We have trudged through generations of factionalism and civil strife, but Iranians have always seen a light at the end of this daunting tunnel. We must take solace in the fact that we have overcome so many challenges and hardships, and as we recover our strength through building up towns and developing our own infrastructure, we will set our sights on the various regions where Iranian people once dominated. We will not be denied what rightfull belongs to us! We will follow in the steps of our ancestors and usher in a new age of Iranian dominance!"

 bal_emphasis_on_logistics: "Supplies and Logistics"
 bal_emphasis_on_logistics_desc: "If there is one thing that living in this region has taught us, it is that going without an assured supply of food, water, and materials is a death sentence. That is exactly why we are so keen on providing our own soldiers and civilians checkpoints and rest areas so that they can gather what they need before moving on. If we can maintain our own health internally, we will be better prepared to strike against our enemies when the time is right."
 bal_swift_skirmishing: "Skirmish to the End"
 bal_swift_skirmishing_desc: "Arid lands like ours (save for the southern edge of the Caspian Sea) are rife with opportunities to have small, compact battles of a few thousand soldiers instead of massive armies ranging in the hundreds of thousands. It is this upbringing of ours with regards to emphasizing skirmishes over pitched battles that has led to how we fight today for Iranian land: swift movements, lightly armored cavalry, and putting our infantry in key positions so that they can be withstand the massed attacks of our enemies."
 bal_tombs_to_the_past: "Mausoleums and Tombs"
 bal_tombs_to_the_past_desc: "The influences of previous conquerors and leaders who came through Iranian land ensured that we would be a region of regal art and architecture. Yet, these structures honor not only the divine and the currently living, but they also are fit for our past rulers who made our state what it is. Whether they are made of sandstone, limestone, or even marble, we will make sure that the various graves to our ancestors are revered by all in our state and that they are safe pilgramage sites for generations to come."
 bal_moving_toward_non_religious_politics: "Religious and Secular Matters"
 bal_moving_toward_non_religious_politics_desc: "Islam's influence across the various Iranian people who survive to this day is unmatched. Zoroastrian traditions are scattered throughout various pockets of our land too just as Hindu celebrations and ceremonies fill in niche parts of our eastern, but all too often these various religious influences clash due to zealous clerics and nobles try to force their faith on to others. Perhaps it is time we work to cleanse our politics of these religious tones and bloodshed; it could help stabilize the state and serve as a catalyst to help resolve age-old disputes that were emboldened by official religious backing."

 aze_tumultuous_arab_iranian_history: "Arab-Iranian Conflicts"
 aze_tumultuous_arab_iranian_history_desc: "With how the Sassanid Empire of the past fell to Arab invasion, it should not be surprising that the remnants of the old Zoroastrian state that held out elsewhere gave it their all to resist encroaching Arab invaders. Through centuries of victories and defeats on both sides, dynastic lineages have crossed over and several claims to legitimacy are hazy at best, but that does not impede our progress as a unified Iranian state. These conflicts that in turn bred the mixing of Arabian and Iranian cultures has given us ample fuel for conquest both in the form of claims and in the form of methods of governance."
 aze_relations_between_turks_and_iranians: "Turkic-Iranian Relations"
 aze_relations_between_turks_and_iranians_desc: "Being at the crossroads of various invaders, Iranian land has been home to the Mongols and the Turkic people as well in the past. The Turkic people created the Seljuk Empire some centuries ago, yet their population did not come into steep conflict with Iranian people like how the Arabs did; instead there has been a sort of intermingling of sorts in several areas we call our own today. It is thanks to this intermixing of Turkic and Iranian people in several areas that we can say with confidence that we can and will work with the Turkic communities of our land to keep politics from unfolding in the future."
 aze_fluidity_in_moving_people: "Mass Movements of People"
 aze_fluidity_in_moving_people_desc: "We have seen huge fluctuations in demographics across the whole of our heartland in the past. Places like Isfahan, Herat, and Tabriz have been the host of several different rulers and communities, the latter of which have either moved on to different places or have integrated into these growing urban centers. Perhaps we should look into how and why people engage in these mass movements of sorts and utilize these demographic shifts to shape our state into something more to our liking. It won't be without blood or protests, but it might be a cost we should pay."
 aze_guardians_of_fire: "Guardians of Fire"
 aze_guardians_of_fire_desc: "For what seems like ages we have seen the lands of Iranian people desecrated by invaders and outside forces, but still the memories from olden times live on in the hearts of our people. Through good governance, righteous decisions, a healthy amount of piety, and more than enough military strength, we have and still are proving ourselves to be guardian of the Iranian people. Our muskets and cannons shall be the protectors of the collective fire that burns within all Iranian people, ranging from those in Shirvan and Tabriz to those in Herat and Kabul. It is only through our leadership that we can prevent that fire from ever dying out."

 wes_ary_hajj_ports_and_trade_cities_desc: "In the lands of the Gujarati people, there are several ports with lively urban centers and thriving dockyards that see ships coming and going from across the western waters. These places are important places of trade, yes, but they are also important places for Muslims going on Hajj as they are easy to access comparitvely safe to travel from. Ensuring these 'Hajj Ports' are safe year-round will open them up to not only increased population movement, but also increased trade revenue."
 wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation: "Lively Cultivation Measures"
 wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation_desc: "The fertility of Bharat's land is varied as many know if they travel around, but that doesn't stop taxes from flowing and crops from growing. Technology advances ever more in Bharat's land and we should be using this technology to streamline the cultivation of crops, organize the division of labor from area to area and region to region, and refine the taxation practices handed down to us from generations before."
 wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors: "Warriors across Bharat"
 wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors_desc: "Warfare has shaped several parts of Bharat's history in ways similar to how the interactions between religions in its past have come to shape its intellectual stances. Whilst warfare is becoming more oriented to organized armies with gunpowder at the ready, we must never forget the soldier at the bottom of the list: the peasant soldier. In dire times they have been relied on for the defense for various communities and states across Bharat's long history, but today we can shape them into a sizable population ready for recruitment and ready for training."
 wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion: "Regardless of Religion"
 wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion_desc: "Philosophy and theology, two subjects intertwined from their roots to their branches in Bharat! An extensive history of religious dialogue is found across the subcontinent stretching all the way back before the times of Satavahana Empire and the Gupta Empire. Whether it has been Jain ascetics interacting with Shaktists, Shaivists interacting with Mahayana Buddhists, or even a Vaishnavist interacting with an Ibadi Muslim, Bharat has and will continue to be a grand home for religious dialogue across several spectrums."
 wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas: "Gunpowder Arm of Bharat"
 wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas_desc: "The vastness of Bharat's land means there are several autonomous communities that our government has a hard time keeping track of, and it is in these autonomous communities that we find several instances of 'purbiya', mercenary soldiers skilled with gunpowder weapons (and mainly of Rajput origin). Though enforcing more laws on these communities where they live is going to be hard and expensive, we can at the very least work to integrate the purbiyas into Bharat's military as a more elite gunpowder arm to bolster the effectiveness of our armies, albeit at the cost of a little bit of money here and there."
 wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures: "Mercantile Voyages Westward"
 wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures_desc: "Since the fall of the Chola Empire centuries ago, these lands of ours have rarely seen extensive mercantile voyages to far off lands in search of opportunity both for trade and for increased political influence. Whilst the latter is certainly harder to achieve for now, the former is looking more and more likely thanks to the safety we project across our coastal cities. Adventuring traders of Saurashtri, Tamil, Tamil, and Bengali heritage are petitioning our administration to charter voyages across the ocean so that they can bolster our trade influence and line their own pockets; why haven't we funded them earlier?"
 wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all: "Honor Every Ancestor"
 wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all_desc: "One facet that Muslim dynasties helped bring to the attention to Hindu, Jains, and Buddhists alike is that of monumental buildings. Truly the places built to honor the dead ancestors of these dynasties are magnificent in their size and beautiful in their details, just like how several temples of Hindu and Buddhist origin are intricately designed and built to honor various deities or key figures. Going forward from here, constructing similarly monumental structures for revered ancestors would go a long way to showing our respect for others in our land, not just our own core people."

 south_supremacy_of_architecture: "Unrivaled Architecture"
 south_supremacy_of_architecture_desc: "All across our land, we can see that there are many buildings that have been erected by people of various times, faiths, and cultures, but what are we to do in light of these accomplishments? Why, we should attempt to build more monuments when and where we can so we can take our place amongst the giants of our past! From temples to statues to palaces, all of Bharat will know just how much effort we put into everything we construct."
 south_rocketry_of_india: "Rockets in Action"
 south_rocketry_of_india_desc: "Gunpowder weapons have been used across our subcontinent for a while, but refining the usage of them into muskets alone has taken quite a while. We struggle sometimes in using these now standard weapons effectively, but with time we will master them both their smaller and larger forms; muskets and rockets alike will become the backbone of Bharat's military. Eventually, if we develop the larger weapons over time, we could be seeing rockets used in pitched battles as well!"
 south_malayali_poetry_in_action: "Blossoming of Poetry"
 south_malayali_poetry_in_action_desc: "The Tamil and Malayali people have a very extensive history of literature in general with poets writing poetry many hundreds of years ago. This appreciation for literature that our ancestors bestowed upon a very sizable portion of our population is strong even to this day, so much so that we would be foolish to let it grow on its own. Building libraries, sponsoring poets, and encouraging education for our general populace so that they too can take part in the rich literary tradition of Bharat is something we are obligated to do."
 south_dialogue_across_religions: "Speak Clearly; Act Softly"
 south_dialogue_across_religions_desc: "Religious divides have struck down several regions before; we have even heard of the turmoil that has gone on inside the Iranian lands to our west ever since the fall of the House of Sasan. Yet, our home subcontinent has been home to a plethora of religious traditions stemming from some common sources, none of which were actively hostile to each other like how sects of Islam or Christianity were to each other. Fostering this attitude of peaceful and insightful religious dialogue will be the driving force for Bharat's theological and philosophical inner peace."
 south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade: "From Cuttack to Ahmedabad"
 south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade_desc: "All across the waters around us, trade ships flow back and forth bringing valuable materials to distant people and ports. We are the center of this crossing since we have several ports along the coast where these oceanic ships dock at to conduct trade. Building up these docks and coastal towns will only grow our advantage even more and attract wealthy merchants from East Africa, Sumatra, and beyond."
 south_rough_terrain_movements: "Paths Across the Subcontinent"
 south_rough_terrain_movements_desc: "A varied landscape, this subcontinent we call home is nothing short of wondrous in terms of the beautiful natural sites all across, but often times these places are hard to traverse for humans and animals alike. Carving out paths through jungles and hills throughout our land so that civilians and military caravans can get through will save time when going from place to place and also bolster the amount of trade that can happen between our various cities."
 south_lets_dance_the_night_away: "Let's Dance the Night Away"
 south_lets_dance_the_night_away_desc: "Wonderful music, elaborte dances, glorious festivals, and unrivaled blending of cultures together, that is one of the many facets that Bharat brings to the world stage. We work toward a cultural understanding across languages and across religions so that in the future we may live a more harmonious and a more prosperous life; whether it is people practicing Garba or people dancing at the Festival of Colors (otherwise known as Holi), we will bring people together in uplifting celebration."

Bharat is perhaps the first instance of state that has fully unified the subcontinent in its entirety and it is the prime directive of Bharat to manage, integrate, and come to peace with its great variety of people."

 hindu_confluence_of_several_matters_desc: "Religious ideas, trade routes, and conquering lords, all three have come through the subcontinent throughout its extensive history. This storied past makes it a central hub for the mixing of various cultures and religions in general, but who are we to say one is inherently more valuable than the other? Though we patronize Hindu traditions the most, we should always be aware of the influence and the value other groups (both religious and cultural) have imbedded within them."

 hindu_the_many_languages_of_bharat_desc: "When a foreigner comes to visit Bharat, they often are mystified not only by the religious traditions, but also by the languages our people speak as well. They seem as plentiful in variety as there are colors visible to the human eye, and we of Bharat are keen on seeing them used in their local communities instead of being replaced by one courtly language. Respect for the mother tongue of others is what will grant Bharat a step up in the administration of far flung pieces of land."

We must not only keep ourselves armed and ready for these uprisings, but also work to compromise with these locals; understanding their plight and attempting to meet them halfway with certain requests can go a long way in ensuring Bharat's stability."

 hindu_layers_of_defense_desc: "Fortifications are nothing new to Bharat, just like they are nothing new to our neighbors to the far east and to our direct west. What stands out in this observation though is the fact that many fortifications across Bharat are unequal in construction quality and how up-to-date they are. Enacting a series of sweeping defensive reforms to help bolster these fortifications to more modern standards will keep the core regions of Bharat safe from harm. Bharata Khanda will never be exposed to the harsh outside elements of the world like in the past, not again."

What is clear to all in the administration of Bharat is that the Bengal Delta must become the virtual heart of the oceanic trade around our homeland; building markets, promoting shipbuilding, and developing the land so that traders from afar come to us instead of others, that is what will garner Bharat a lavish income."

Bharat has a mutualistic relationship with most Nepali communities, thankfully, and their defensive posture is exactly what Bharat needs with regards to protecting itself. New fortifications, stronger building materials, and defending at the right points across the land, that is what Nepali advisors focus on for now, and it is what we will listen to for the good of Bharat."
 east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people: "Forgotten, but not for Bharat"
 east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people_desc: "Often times there are so many people caught between major states in history, particularly when it comes to terrain that is harsh and divided with ravines and mountains. Bharat is no stranger to such lands and people, meaning that there are a great number of forgotten people that are still integral to making various districts and states functional. Working to recognize them as a whole, and integrating them within our current administrative framework will yield more cooperative local communities and also a stronger base of loyal citizens."
 east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions: "Input from the Three Traditions"
 east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions_desc: "The main three religious traditions that have influenced Bharat so far in its formation are Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. There are certainly other, smaller traditions, but these three present the most pertinent groups of interest that we must address going forward as a nation. Instead of promoting one over the other, or trying to play one group off of another, we should be working to facilitate cooperation between the three so that Bharat can focus on other matters in general."
 east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three: "Respect for the Three Traditions"
 east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three_desc: "In working to ensure cooperation between our three main religious traditions, we have learned to respect all three in equal amounts. Through meeting with various imams and emirs, brahmins and pandits, and also monks and ascetics alike, we are growing our knowledge day by day alongside the loyalty of our people. There are rough patches, of course, but we seek to address them in the light of day instead of invoking one religion over another to stifle dissent and unrest."
 east_ary_assimilation_over_time: "Hospitality and Understanding"
 east_ary_assimilation_over_time_desc: "We can learn a lot from seeking out the history of some of the lesser known people of Bharat, and one of those people groups are that of our northeast, where the Ahom Kingdom once lived. Their own history is very much that of rises and falls intermixed with heavy amounts of assimilation of other people groups from the outside as they moved to be near the Bhramaputra River. If we can learn from this, and other histories that we are looking into, and have a focus on assimilation of people that come into the fold of Bharat, then we will undoubtedly have a more righteous reputation with outsiders."
 east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas: "Rigor of the Himalayas"
 east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas_desc: "Bharat must be protected by a firm military, as every state in this ever-changing world is finding out, yet the training for Bharat's own soldiers are scattered and ill-defined. Promoting more centralized training aimed at the Himalayas (or really any other mountainous region) will help get our soldiers used to harder conditions in general. It might take longer to get suitable soldiers through the process in general since the mountains can be rather deadly at times (which is why we do not use elephants up there), but the end product will be well worth the effort."

 cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past: "Making History by Writing"
 cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past_desc: "There are hundreds if not thousands of tales of lineage and descent across the lands of Bharat, but they are passed down not in the writings of scholars or scribes but instead in the hearts and minds of various royals of both small and large dynasties. Learning about these tales as we thrive and prosper leads only to a stronger understanding of who actually makes up Bharat and what has helped shape it into the very state it is today. Let us chronicle these tales in official texts for future generations, for they deserve to be known by all."
 cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics: "Tropical Upbringing"
 cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics_desc: "Geography has blessed Bharat with plenty of rain and rivers for growth, yet that has also been a menace to some states and people as tropical weather and terrain makes movement and development difficult. But over thousands of years, Bharat's many people groups have carved out livings in the various environments around the subcontinent not least of which is the humid and tropical regions. Taking advantage of these regions will only enhance how Bharat can fight in future wars what with knowledge of rough terrain and environments being inherent in us already."
 cen_ind_nature_will_provide: "Recognition of the Smallest Faiths"
 cen_ind_nature_will_provide_desc: "Hidden within the densest jungles and driest deserts of Bharat, there are communities of people that hold strange beliefs and customs. They contribute to our nation via taxes and production of materials, yes, but the enforcement of various religious laws upon these isolated and hard-to-reach communities has been very hard for many generations even before Bharat became unified. Perhaps it is time we give recognition to these small sects and traditions instead of trying to root them out; they could bring a degree of theological insight that our scholars have yet to come across."
 cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements: "Shift the Ground, Reap Rewards"
 cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements_desc: "Bharat is a nation of the earth, the very earth that gives us plentiful crops, foundations to build upon, and paths for rivers to flow across. It is through the development of villages, cities, and fortifications in various terrain types that has allowed previous states across the subcontinent to flourish, and that knowledge of how to cultivate the land for both economic growth and defensive positions is what is granted to our own nation today."
 cen_ind_fight_to_survive: "The Many Edges of Destruction"
 cen_ind_fight_to_survive_desc: "What is certain about the past eras of the subcontinent is that peace was never destined to last. Whether it was the Gupta Empire fighting against nomadic invaders or the Ghurid invasion along the Ganges River or the Delhi Sultanate conquering southward past Gulbarga, these lands have been the subject of conquest after conquest with Hindu and Muslim states struggling to survive. Our upbringing prior to Bharat was no different, struggling to survive in a maelstrom of various polities vying for dominance across generations. That tenacity, that deep-seated struggle for survival, it still lives within Bharat to this very day."
 cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education: "Literacy in the Deepest Areas"
 cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education_desc: "Whilst we marvel at great cities like Delhi and Cuttack, we have other villages and towns completely shrouded in mystery due to them being so isolated in jungles and forests. Yet, our development of the land has revealed a great many of these previously isolated communities, and our introduction of innovations in city building has led to rising amounts of literacy across the nation. Promoting the building of schools and libraries even in the deepest and most isolated areas of Bharat will serve to strengthen the administration far into the future and bear out new innovations later on."
 cen_ind_without_absolute_authority: "Consultation with Others"
 cen_ind_without_absolute_authority_desc: "Absolute authority in Bharat is an impossibility, dictated by the facts other empires that came before us on the subcontinent knew all too well. Ranging from several different people groups to various religious sects scattered throughout and even just handling the geographic challenges alone for communication, it all makes for a nation that needs to gover by several tiers of administrative processes. Much like how several familial groups in Bharat see the family unit as part of a larger whole, so to will these tiers of administration be part of the larger, all encompassing nation itself."

 wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes: "Western Trade Routes, Secured"
 wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes_desc: "Routes to the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and East Africa have been plentiful across the western waters, but they have usually been controlled by petty dynasties stemming from Sindh, Gujarat, and the Deccan. Now that we have secured these lands firmly and let trade centers begin to cultivate a prosperous, undisturbed existence, we can begin the recruitment of foreign and domestic talent for the likes of the Hindustani administration."
 wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation: "Urban Centers of Hindustani Growth"
 wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation_desc: "In places like Delhi, Ujjain, Thatta, Bidar, and Dhaka, cities are growing with such speed that in just a single century, some cities double in population alone. It is staggering how we are able to see such growth in our unified subcontinent, yet we must always be on watch for how we can refine how we develop the infrastructure in these growing cities. Not only this, but looking to how economics change thanks to farmers utilizing new tools and selling to new markets alongside how cities start to change consumption patters will give us new insights into how to manage our own finances."
 wes_ary_deccani_subjugation: "From Maharashtra to Tamilakam"
 wes_ary_deccani_subjugation_desc: "From the lands of the Marathi people to the lands of the Tamil people, the Deccan and Tamilakam itself have been hard to conquer and maintain true control over. Hindustan is a thriving state, yes, but it is one with tension as well as the Deccan is home to various people groups that compete with each other and have their own interests and bases of power. If we can concentrate these people groups toward working in our military through a variety of military developments and projects, then we will be able to not only have a fighting force that is high in quality but also plentiful routes for supplies and movement (civilian and military-wise)."
 #wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion: #SAME AS THE ONE USED IN BHARAT'S WESTERN ARYAN VERSION##
 #wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion_desc: #SAME AS THE ONE USED IN BHARAT'S WESTERN ARYAN VERSION##
 wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military: "Noble and Honored Families, Subservient"
 wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military_desc: "It is not in question that there are dozens upon dozens of royal families all across Hindustan. Some lead righteous and noble communities, others lead smaller and secluded lives, but all of them have a stake in Hindustan's health, economically and militarily. Whilst we have largely sorted out how they will pay taxes and bring forth goods like dyes, fruits, and manufactured goods to our vast internal market, we have yet to sort out how they will be contributing to our military. Now is the time to do as such, with a strong system of organized ranks and regiments to go along with these still prominent royals."
 wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly: "Oceanic Domination"
 wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly_desc: "The power of Hindustan is apparent in many places around us, perhaps most of all in the trade routes going by our coasts and sailing across the waters that surround our subcontinent. Extending our reach into these trade routes that are aided by seasonal monsoon weather will only bolster our economy and give us an even better chance at extending Hindustan's influence into places like Sumatra, Java, the Arabian Peninsula, and East Africa."
 wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world: "At Peace with Iranian Influence"
 wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world_desc: "Ghazanvids, Ghurids, Bahmanids, Ilyas Shahi, and more; all of these dynasties that have had (or possibly still do have) considerable influence throughout the lands that Hindustan calls its own now. With each new dynasty and especially with the advent of the Delhi Sultanate's rise and collapse, Iranian culture seeped into the various pockets of the subcontinent. Sufis, emirs, and nawabs alike intermixed and played pivotal roles in introducing this wondrous land to various aspects of Iranian culture, and it is in Hindustan that the cultural blending crystallizes into its greatest form."

 south_lively_culture_and_festivals: "Sing, Dance, and Celebrate!"
 south_lively_culture_and_festivals_desc: "Across Hindustan we see various celebrations and festivals going on every single year, yet some puritanical and zealous members of our faith insist on cracking down on some of these purely Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist events. We are wise enough to turn these demands down as the wondrous music played and the dances performed ensure that the populace is happy and content to some degree. Perhaps our ruler will even join in on occasion, or personally sponsor some of these colorful events."
 south_elephants_and_gunpowder: "New Uses for War Elephants"
 south_elephants_and_gunpowder: "War elephants are by no means unheard of across Hindustan, but the usage of them has been in decline for decades now. Gunpowder weapons are making it so that war elephants are more of a liability than a nearly unstoppable force, but we can change this! If we use our elephants from range with some light artillery pieces, they will be able to effectively support our troops from high up in the field of battle. Plus, the high position allows for a better chance at hitting the enemy instead of firing through our own soldiers just to hit the enemy."
 south_resource_monopolies: "One State to Rule Them All"
 south_resource_monopolies_desc: "Undoubtedly our control over the southern reaches of the subcontinent has garnered us immense profits from taxation alone, but we also must take into account the resources produced too, like various spices and tropical wood. Working with local Malayalam communities will help ensure that our production quotas are always met and that our hegemony over ocean trade is never in jeopardy."
 south_southern_martial_arts: "Promoting Martial Arts"
 south_southern_martial_arts_desc: "Close quarters combat is something well known across the subcontinent, but our main base of power stemming from the southern reaches means that an emphasis on martial arts is certainly present. From the Tamil weapon-based Silambam to the Malayalam Kalaripayattu and more, we will be encouraging the usage of these various combat forms for both recreational purposes and to help harden our military force when they are not on active duty."
 south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions: "Mutualistic Internal Relations"
 south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions_desc: "Tamil people are very influential across Hindustan now that it is a unified state. Coastal cities and lively urban centers often have at least a small and noticeable Tamil population in them, and as they continue to spread out and influence our internal politics, we should do our part and give them respect. Hiring Tamil traders, using Tamil soldiers, and integrating the Tamil language as a whole, it is all part of the active internal cooperation Hindustan strives to foster."
 south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths: "Minority over Hindustan"
 south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths_desc: "Islam is by no means the majority in Hindustan and it never has been. Hinduism and its many traditions combined with Jainism and Buddhism vastly outdo our faith in terms of number of adherents, yet that has not stopped us from unifying the land under one flag and one administration. Learning from this step-by-step experience on conquering and integrating various communities across the subcontinent has made us keenly aware of how we should and should not reconcile differences between faiths on both the large and small scale."
 south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making: "Weaving Greater Industries"
 south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making_desc: "Hindustan is a grand exporter of dyes, woven clothes, and precious jewels that nobles all across the world would love to have. These outside demands need to be met somehow, or we might be left struggling to compete against our neighbors who are also making leaps to promote their own products on the slowly expanding global market. Investing in new technology that can help our weavers, miners, and farmers get their job done efficiently is exactly what Hindustan needs to secure its place in the globe."

 hindu_raise_up_great_monuments: "Superior Designs of Prestige"
 hindu_raise_up_great_monuments_desc: "From Delhi to Kannauj, and from Chittor to Bidar, monuments are scattered across the subcontinent just waiting to be cultivated even further. Not only this, but new monuments that are both prestigious and functional are waiting to be built by our artisans and engineers. Who are we to stop this march of greatness into the future? And who are we to stop the world from gazing upon our work with amazement?"
 hindu_ganges_river_focus: "Heart of the Ganges River"
 hindu_ganges_river_focus_desc: "Bringing fertility to so many stretches of land across the northern part of our nation, the Ganges River is holy to more than just Hindus alone for good reason. By building up more communities around the river itself, promoting proper irrigation of various fertile lands, and building decent roads beside the river itself, we will ensure a consistent stream of food, taxes, and tradable material."
 hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions: "Many Minds with Many Truths"
 hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions_desc: "The northern part of Hindustan (especially from Delhi to Dhaka and Thatta) has been subjected to a myriad of Muslim rulers over the past centuries, yet before then it was a haven to Hindu rulers alongside Buddhist and Jain folks who were widely influential on politics. These seismic shifts in power across the ages has yielded a plethora of outcomes, though we have benefited from the theological and philosophical one mostly. Breaking down the barriers between these religious traditions is perhaps one of the greatest gifts upon Hindustan itself."
 hindu_professional_upcoming_military: "Higher Standards for Hindustan"
 hindu_professional_upcoming_military_desc: "Gunpowder is a good resource for our military to use, but in an unorganized and decentralized military force, gunpowder won't do much of anything. What Hindustan needs is to refine how its weaponry are made, how they are distributed, and most importantly to us going forward, how they are used in battle. It is not going to be easy getting thousands of recruits to know how to handle, clean, reload, and fire a musket properly, but Hindustan will drill them into knowing allof it better than any other military around the world."
 hindu_militant_punjabi_communities: "Rein in Militant Communities"
 hindu_militant_punjabi_communities_desc: "The rise of a centralized military structure and a more adept administration across Hindustan is seen by many as a good thing, but some communities of people wish to retain autonomy in various ways. Instead of cracking down on these communities of people (who can and have fought back against our attempts to rein them in), we should be striving to work with them and making compromises. For example, they can serve in the Hindustani military sector in exchange for increased local autonomy... For now."
 hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion: "Unrivaled Urban Expansion"
 hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion_desc: "Our policies regarding taxation, constructing functional buildings inside growing cities, and simply having a degree of peace settle across the landscape has resulted in an unprecedented growth in the size of urban centers. Though this growth is causing tensions with regards to housing and the growth of the merchant class itself, we cannot deny the benefits we have gained so far."
 hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan: "Logistics of the Subcontinent"
 hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan_desc: "Getting troops, supplies, money, even animals for farms and markets across the subcontinent has proven to be difficult over the past centuries. Roads are often of varied quality and dirt paths are often the norm instead of gravel or stone roads that are easier for everyone to move across. The time has come for drastic changes if we are to rectify the logistical situation of Hindustan; in the future, we will be able to supply our military and our cities with ample grain and materials thanks to our emphasis on solid road networks."

 east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta: "The World around the Delta"
 east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta_desc: "The Bengal Delta is truly a magnificent gift for the people of Hindustan, both great and small. All of our nation benefits from the trade going on in the Bengal Delta as we do business with merchants from Java, Japan, Arabia, and also East Africa. By reinforcing our focus on the Bengal Delta over time and building more harbors as well as docks to service the incoming merchants from abroad, we will emphasize our position as a true trade hub on the world stage."
 east_ary_lessons_of_nepal: "Lessons in the Mountains"
 east_ary_lessons_of_nepal_desc: "Going through and conquering the various parts of the Himalayas that are inhabited by various Nepali people has been trying to say the least. Attrition and infantry-oriented tactics make for a much different playing field, one that has instilled into Hindustan mindset keen on its infantry as the source of military power, and effective siege equipment to deal with dug in defenders."
 east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions: "Religious Movements in Hindustan"
 east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions_desc: "Whilst Hindustan changes throughout its life to face new challenges internally and externally, we must never let our guard down when it comes to the growth of theological challenges too. We are seeing the slow rise of new religious sects and movements in both Hindu and Islamic sectors, but are they truly threats that need military action? The zealous among us say yes, but we are more understanding than they are thanks to our own roots prior to becoming Hindustan; let us speak with these new religious movements and come to terms with them instead of provoking them into conflict."
 east_ary_respect_the_school_of_elders: "The School of Elders, Respected"
 east_ary_respect_the_school_of_elders_desc: "Theravada Buddhism, or, the School of Elders as it is formally known as, is highly influential in certain parts of Hindustan, especially in the east and amongst the Sinhalese people. Though it has several tenets that a mufti or imam of ours would fine strange, the School of Elders shouldn't be shunned in the slightest in Hindustan, for it is this very land we call our home from which the original form of Buddhism arose from and flourished. Respecting the scholars, ascetics, and proponents of Theravada Buddhism will garner us more loyalty amongst citizens and also greater insight into theological issues."
 east_ary_improve_upon_gajapati_organization: "Old Oriya Militarism"
 east_ary_improve_upon_gajapati_organization_desc: "The apex of Oriya power prior to us was that of the Gajapati Empire. A complex and militaristic empire that stretched along the eastern coast, its downfall should not mean Hindustan cannot learn from what happened in its past. The military organization of the Gajapati Empire is one we could actually attempt to improve upon as it had thoroughly defined divisions to work with. If Hindustan can improve upon what was done in the past, it will seem familiar but perform better to those who are used to the old way of things and grant us a greater amount of flexibility militarily."
 east_ary_brahmaputra_and_ganges_authority: "The Ganges and Bhramaputra Rivers"
 east_ary_brahmaputra_and_ganges_authority_desc: "The two main northern rivers by which the Hindustan economy relies upon are the Ganges and the Brahmaputra River, but the Indus River is vital as well despite it only feeding a smaller section of land. What the first two rivers do for us though is undeniable: they feed into the Bengal Delta and provide immense amount of productive potential in the land all along its banks. This means that if we can adapt the usage of various technologies to the wetter conditions of the Bhramaputra as we have done with the Ganges, then we will be an unstoppable economic force on the world stage."
 east_ary_cultural_caste_systems: "Knowing the Many Castes"
 east_ary_cultural_caste_systems_desc: "Throughout Hindustan, there are several versions of what is commonly known to outsiders as the 'caste system'. It is not a 'one size fits all' system when one looks at various communities around the subcontinent with increased focus as certain castes may change in what they do from one region or another, or change in how they are represented from one culture to another. If Hindustan is to sustain a stable administration from the top down, it must look into the castes and not break them down, but rather catalogue and work with them."

 cen_ind_more_than_just_blending_in: "Strictness of Islam, Lifted"
 cen_ind_more_than_just_blending_in_desc: "If one simply takes the Quran and puts it side-by-side next to the Vedas, there is going to be several concepts and ideas in conflict, no? In that same vein, if we were to put the laws dictated by Islam next to the laws dictated by the traditions of the subcontinent and all its diverse people groups, there would be conflicts without end in Hindustan! That is why we have adjusted our laws so heavily to compromise and craft a more stable state, one that cares much less about the actual religion of an advisor or merchant and more so about the inner qualities of the person in question."
 cen_ind_the_good_will_of_sufis: "Sufi Saints of Hindustan"
 cen_ind_the_good_will_of_sufis_desc: "Since our upbringing as a Muslim minority ruling over a Hindu majority, the sufis of our nation have done work in so many fields that we would be a dead state without them. Sponsoring more to come in from the lands of Iran and Arabia will only help Hindustan flourish far into the future, and they will also continue to help bridge the gap between Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, and Muslim communities."
 cen_ind_mastery_of_ruling_through_others: "Networks and Systems of Subjects"
 cen_ind_mastery_of_ruling_through_others_desc: "One perk we have gained from our upbringing is that of knowing just how to rule through other administrators such as viziers, emirs, nawabs, and even rajas. Governing the scattered lands of Hindustan is by no means an easy task for any ruler, but these various advisors and courtiers help see to it that even the communities in the furthest reaches such as those of the Garjat Hills and the Thar Desert are never out of our reach."
 cen_ind_rework_revenue_streams: "Revenue Refinement"
 cen_ind_rework_revenue_streams_desc: "Rebellious sentiment can easily build up in Hindustan if our administration is too relaxed on how it conducts simple things like collecting taxes or conducting trade, which is why we should take the time to carefully examine how we are doing both in with our most rural provincial officials. Refining these parts of our administration especially will help keep rebellious sentiment in check and also keep our revenue in order for the future."
 cen_ind_indirect_expertise: "Learn the Land, Master the Earth"
 cen_ind_indirect_expertise_desc: "Mastering the land itself is something that takes generations to do, but the results of it are immense in every positive sense of the word. Our fortifications will tower over the land yet be positioned in such a way that they make the enemy suffer much more during long sieges. Our cities as well will eventually be ordered in such a way that civilians and military personnel are able to move through with ease thanks to paved roads, proper drainage, and well taken care of logistics."
 cen_ind_firearms_of_the_tropics: "Weather Adapted Weapons"
 cen_ind_firearms_of_the_tropics_desc: "One thing that has plagued gunpowder weapons in Hindustan for generations now is the humidity and the rain; they just won't work if things are too wet! That is why our engineers have been out in the tropical areas where the Gondi and Jharkhandi people live, testing new devices and designs that mitigate this problem somewhat. These new firearms are not the greatest and perhaps only have limited usage in certain wet conditions, but they will give an advantage if we distribute them properly and train enough troops with them."
 cen_ind_pragmatism_over_zealotry: "Pragamtic Administrators"
 cen_ind_pragmatism_over_zealotry_desc: "If there is one word that sums up how Hindustan handles much of its politics, it is this: pragmatism. Handling so many things in a realistic sense rather than a perhaps religious or militaristic sense has granted Hindustan many perks and favors over the years, and it is because of this pragmatic attitude that we are able to do without things like building restrictions on certain religious communities or militarization of certain areas that are better suited for other purposes. We are a sensible nation, looking to do sensible things internally with our own people."

 #Orleans Ideas#
 one_of_the_richest_french_cities: "Three Key Cities of France"
 one_of_the_richest_french_cities_desc: "The Loire River provides France with immense amounts of water, yes, but it also provides France with immense amounts of dangerous river crossings. The bridges required to cross the Loire River are not plentiful and because of this, only a few cities across France have been able to propser besides the Loire River. Paris and Rouen have been the other two key cities that have been instrumental in French economic growth as of late, yet Orleans is certainly not counted out of this set of cities, not when business is looking up."
 she_made_us_famous: "Joan of Arc"
 she_made_us_famous_desc: "8th of May, 1429, that was the fateful day where Joan of Arc (with the help of royal generals Dunois and Florent d'Illers) was able to enter the city to help lift the siege from the Plantagenets during the prolonged Hundred Years' War. Her efforts and her memory last on in Orleans to this very day and veneration of her is not uncommon throughout the city and its rural areas. We would be foolish to let this memory go to waste when teaching and training the soldiers of Orleans, no, we should use her example to invigorate the commanders and soldiers alike!"
 exports_of_saffron_from_orleans: "Agriculture in Orleans on the Rise"
 exports_of_saffron_from_orleans_desc: "The Hundred Years' War took a great toll on the economies of both England and France as the prolonged warfare meant that levies and taxes had to be taken from peasants and nobility across multiple decades for little return. Orleans was affected by this as well, unfortunately, but the rebound we are experiencing now is something we should be focused on! Farming is on the rise, structures in the city center are coming together, and most importantly, saffron is being grown once more. Such a delectable spice being resurgent in Orleans is sure to attract hungry merchants from across Europe!"
 chatelains_of_orleans_know_fashion: "Chatelains, Keepers of Style"
 chatelains_of_orleans_know_fashion_desc: "The chatelains (castle keepers) of Orleans are snobbish and stuck-up a lot of the time, but there are instances where that arrogant nature benefits us as a whole. They were eccentric and unique clothing styles compared to other chatelains throughout French lands and they can often times be found idly chatting about the latest trends in what other nobles and royals are wearing. It may be a meaningless subject to peasants or soldiers, but to courtiers and royalty, being of high prestige and uniquely good appearance helps make for good relations."
 invigoration_in_our_university: "Philisophy and Theology in Orleans"
 invigoration_in_our_university_desc: "Established with the oversight of Pope Clement V in 1306, the University of Orleans has been a central facet of our growth as a city and more recently, as a state within French lands vying for power and influence. Though the Catholic Church may look down on us for hosting theological and philosophical debates regarding a myriad of topics, we will not stand in the way of progress when it comes to exploring new ideas. The university is where these ideas will be tested with rigor so that only the best ones are used in the administration of Orleans."
 hoc_venant_lilla_corde: "'Hoc Vernant Lilla Corde'"
 hoc_venant_lilla_corde_desc: "'It is by this heart that lillies flourish'. Such a motto is slowly becoming what many advisors and courtiers say about Orleans as a whole. Increasingly we are seen as an integral part of the idea of 'France' on a political map and as a concept to strive; if claimants to the French throne do not have influence or ties with Orleans, they are likely to be on unstable ground if and when they ascend to the throne itself. We should use this amount of influence we have wisely, for every step we take in diplomacy and politics is noted by royals not just in French lands, but in English, German, Italian, and even Iberian lands."

#Ming Ideas#
 MNG_ideas: "Ming Ideas"
 MNG_ideas_start: "Ming Traditions"
 MNG_ideas_bonus: "Ming Ambition"
 plays_in_the_transitional_zone: "Yuan's Pretenders; Ming's Lessons"
 plays_in_the_transitional_zone_desc: "The Yuan Dynasty has remnants scattered throughout the northern lands that are the steppes and desert as many descendants of the Yuan Dynasty are still vying for power. These attempts at gaining power do include raiding and intruding on what is rightfully territory of the Ming Dynasty, meaning that we have had to double up our fortification efforts along the Great Wall. Not only this, but the encounters with cavalry-based militaries of the Yuan pretenders has also taught a great portion of our military how to deal with their tactics, thereby granting us an edge against them in future conflicts."
 joint_administration_on_the_frontier: "Double Standards"
 joint_administration_on_the_frontier_desc: "Minorities living at the edges of our realm are something we must always be aware of; if they are mistreated or abused by local magistrates and governors, then they can easily foment unrest in hard-to-reach areas and cause great deal of strife later on. We should work to have two standards in place since our core populace of Han Chinese are often times living with or nearby these minority communities: one set of standards for those of Han Chinese classification, and another set of standards for those of non-Han Chinese classification (with further sub-divisions of laws for various minorities given the exact region/area)."
 commissioning_of_texts: "Commission New Texts"
 commissioning_of_texts_desc: "The Red Turban Rebellion set in motion the transition from one dynasty to another, that much is clear to all by now, but what wasn't clear to us just after the rebellion was what would happen to the literary tradition and legacy we have before us. Now that things have stabilized and the Ming Dynasty has solidified its place in the world, we can work on commissioning new texts around philosophy, metaphysics, administration, astronomy, agriculture, mathematics, and more. The texts will undoubtedly serve to promote our wealth and grandeur whilst also spreading innovative ideas around our realm."
 contending_with_piracy_in_the_east: "Proper Naval Measures"
 contending_with_piracy_in_the_east_desc: "The lucrative trade alongside our coast makes for a wide open and vast target for piracy which has historically been an issue previous dynasties had to deal with. We are no different in this sense and must work toward outfitting our ships with better fierarms, robust designs, and coastal fortifications that can support our fleets when they need it."
 dealing_with_multi_ethnic_and_corrupt_armies: "Varied Troops with Corruption"
 dealing_with_multi_ethnic_and_corrupt_armies_desc: "It is not secret that in the lands of the Ming Dynasty, being in the military is looked down upon by the rest of society. It isn't prestigious nor noble like some foreigners would normally think since most soldiers are illiterate and not under the command of civil officials, leading to immense corruption at times; this can be further amplified by the multi-ethnic status of our military. What we must do is work toward educating parts of the military and in essence giving it a slightly higher place in society. A healthy dose of civil authority and measures to shed some light on this shady sector of the Ming Dynasty will go a long way to improving the overall quality."
 our_art_surpasses_the_song_and_yuan: "Evolving Artistic Styles"
 our_art_surpasses_the_song_and_yuan_desc: "The Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty had their respective zeniths with regards to artistry and much of it is still exemplified today, but the question remains as to how will we impact this legacy of artistic endeavors. Whether we patronize sculpting, monument builders, or perhaps even portrait painters, we will take up the artistic legacy left to us and usher in a new cultural flourishing that will make neighboring tributaries lust like never before."
 toward_the_three_divisions_and_beyond: "Innovating from Weisuo"
 toward_the_three_divisions_and_beyond_desc: "The Hongwu Emperor set up for us the 'weisuo' system of military organization which was similar to the 'fubing' system of the Tang Dynasty, but we are realizing more and more that it is becoming outdated. Firearms both big and small are making it so that new military divisions are overtaking the old ones, so much so that the new three core divisions are becoming too integral to do without; these three divisions are: Shenjiying (Firearms Division), Wujunying (Five Barracks Battallion), and Sanqianying (Three Thousand Batallion). Transitioning to these divisions fully will take time, but it will ensure that the Ming Dynasty is ready to innovate on its own military for the future."

#Nagpur Ideas#
 lessons_on_understanding_differences: "Coming to Know Every Community"
 lessons_on_understanding_differences_desc: "We know the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi people very well, but those outside of our cultural sphere are seen as strange or foreign throughout the heart of Nagpur. In our expansion outward, we will put forth programs and policies to help integrate these foreign people coming into Nagpur. Their culture will be respected, their language will be known, and their customs will be seen as integral to all of Nagpur over time, even if it takes a few generations to do so."
 regarldess_of_religion_you_work: "Communal Work Ethic"
 regarldess_of_religion_you_work_desc: "Even our own practices that are regarded as Hindu in nature is seen as strange by those of Shaivism, Shaktism, and Vaishnavism. Often times our own people have integrated Hindu, Buddhist, or even sometiems Islamic customs into local followings and traditions, meaning that our core set of people know exactly how to deal with outside religious differences. In overcoming these religious differences, Nagpur can and will see a stronger push for a communal work ethic that can bring about great works within towns and cities."
 raiding_through_swift_cavalry: "Swift Raids of Nagpur"
 raiding_through_swift_cavalry_desc: "The location of Nagpur being in the heart of the subcontinent means that prolonged sieges and pitched battles have been less common throughout its history. Instead what we see skirmishes and sieges shorter in length alongside the raiding of villages and towns for resources; at times, successful raids could even turn into conquests. We of Nagpur carry forth this tradition into the future as we focus more on mobility for raiding and striking at the enemy when they least expect it; if these tactics also yield bountiful plunder for our treasury, that is merely icing on the cake."
 welcome_the_maratha_warriors_inside: "Integration of Maratha Families"
 welcome_the_maratha_warriors_inside_desc: "The Marathas are ambitious in their own right as they have struggled under the leadership of various rajas and sultans alike, but we should not succumb to the pressure they put on Nagpur as a whole. Integrating them into our military and our warrior caste will bolster Nagpur's reputation with the large Maratha population throughout the Deccan whilst also emboldening others who look up the Maratha warriors to pledge fealty to the Nagpur military."
 heart_of_subcontinental_conflict: "In the Firey Heart"
 heart_of_subcontinental_conflict_desc: "The land which we call home has seen conquest after conquest by various rulers and dynasties. From the Satavahana Dynasty to the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, and from the Kalachuris of Mahishmati to the Delhi Sultanate, our very existence is within the heat of the furnace that is this subcontinent. Picking up our weapons to defend our own borders and to settle old feuds is nothing new to any family in Nagpur, so let us formalize this militant attitude of ours with officers and soldiers that can go toe-to-toe with any enemy."
 aiding_and_striking_rebels_down: "Land of Shades and Secrets"
 aiding_and_striking_rebels_down_desc: "Within our heartland are hidden paths and barely charted villages that hide out in the tropical areas where movement is tough and conducting battle is even worse. It is in these parts of Nagpur that political exiles have kept themselves at times so that they can wait for the right time to return to their own land, but what if we could use them for our own purposes? And what if we could actually garner knowledge on these remote communities within our own borders? Such information would mean that striking down our own political exiles and rebel leaders would be much easier."
 monsoon_knowledge_and_regularity: "Aged by the Monsoons"
 monsoon_knowledge_and_regularity_desc: "The weather of Nagpur is very seasonal what with the rainy season producing any number of results for our people depending on how much comes down. It is this consistent monsoon cycle that we need to catalogue, predict, and learn to work with so that the goods of Nagpur are not compromised by unprepared workers and families. The more time we invest into this matter, the better off we will be in the future when new technologies change how we cultivate certain crops like cotton and fruits."

#Lan Xang Ideas#
 the_terror_inside_lan_xang_for_12_years: "12 Years of Anarchy"
 the_terror_inside_lan_xang_for_12_years_desc: "From about 1428 to 1440 there was almost no internal cohesion within Lan Xang. The death of Lan Kham Daeng ushered in a period of strife so great that few nobles and monks could tell who was actually the ruler of Lan Xang; even Vientiane revolted against the fractured administration. Thankfully we have stamped out the flames of anarchy from back then and are well on our way to establishing Lan Xang's dominance across all internal domains. The next time regicide and revolt are threatened against Lan Xang, we will be far more prepared."
 mandala_established_by_fa_ngum: "Reinforce the Mandala of Lan Xang"
 mandala_established_by_fa_ngum_desc: "The concept of the mandala on a political level is much older than Lan Xang itself, though that does not mean that Lan Xang should be subjected to its rules at every single point. There are times where we will need to enforce our mandala over the others surrounding Lan Xang and assert proper authority over places ruled by Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai, and even Burmese people alike. If we can get these various people groups around us to recognize the central mandala established by Fa Ngum in 1357, they will be all the more willing to serve us through tribute and service."
 sacred_is_the_phra_bang: "Sacred is the Phra Bang"
 sacred_is_the_phra_bang_desc: "Our palladium, our grandiose image of grandeur and legitimacy that is greatly revered across most of the heart of Lan Xang is called the Phra Bang. It's symbolism is not lost on any peasant, monk, or noble of our land that sees it, for it has been with us since the inception of Lan Xang itself by Fa Ngum. With it safely in Luang Prabang, it is seen as a sign generally as the right to rule over Lan Xang as only a venerable and virtuous ruler and their administration may be the caretaker of such a sacred image. So long as Luang Prabang and its inner areas are safe from harm, Phra Bang is assured safety and so are we."
 translate_the_classics_into_lao: "Buddhist Classics, Translated"
 translate_the_classics_into_lao_desc: "with our growing power and influence, the rise in the number of people that can read and write is certainly being felt all across Lan Xang. Lao people from lower classes are picking up manuscripts and attempting to read them whilst those fortunate enough to have the capability are trying to integrate writing into their daily lives. It is here that we can improve on the religious foundation of Lan Xang by translating the old Buddhist texts like the Tripitaka from Sanskrit or Pali into Lao. In doing this, we will be seen as publicly encouraging literacy and intrigue into new and old ideas alike."
 master_the_mekong_river: "Masters of the Mekong River"
 master_the_mekong_river_desc: "Through the heart of Lan Xang is the mighty Mekong River, a bountiful though dangerous asset to have for any state wishing to wrest control over the region. Much like the Khmer to our south, we are in the midst of learning how to properly master the Mekong's various crossing points and seasonal shifts. If we can do as such and ready ourselves for when heavy rain is coming or for swift movements where the river is calm enough, we will be one step ahead of our enemies in terms of mobility and defense."
 muang_and_vieng_classifications: "Muangs and Viengs"
 muang_and_vieng_classifications_desc: "The classification of 'muang' and 'vieng' are not set in stone, but they are generally seen as meaning major cities, towns, or settlements with fortified walls. Defining these terms more clearly and putting our resources into building up walled settlements that can withstand both enemy sieges and natural weather will mean that we can rely on a strong defense whilst our offense is getting ready."
 blended_buddhism_within_lan_xang: "Old Traditions Never Die"
 blended_buddhism_within_lan_xang_desc: "Despite the heavy presence of Theravada Buddhism throughout Lan Xang, old beliefs persist throughout the hills and highlands where communities are more isolated in general. We should not try to openly convert these communities in the hills as they can easily become unreachable havens of rebel sentiment. Working with them and respecting their beliefs is a much more harmonious way of approaching the situation as even though they still practice old beliefs that are not Buddhist in nature, they do integrate several Buddhist traditions alongside their own."

#Dai Viet Ideas#
 from_ruler_to_favorite_son: "From Ruler to Favorite Son"
 from_ruler_to_favorite_son_desc: "It is a practice dating all the way back in the Tran Dynasty (1225-1400) and continued into the era of Dai Ngu (1400-1407), bequeathing the throne to a designated son is what is normal within Dai Viet. We do not let petty sons fight over the throne with various armies assembled across the state for that only leads to horrible civil wars. Instead we will continue the practice of knowing which child is ordered to succeed the throne so as to instill a greater sense of legitimacy at court and amongst landed elites."
 satisfy_ming_pride_whilst_being_independent: "Orderly Tributary Status"
 satisfy_ming_pride_whilst_being_independent_desc: "Coming out of the Fourth Chinese Domination of our lands (1407-1427), Le Loi established a formal tributary relationship between Dai Viet and the Ming Dynasty. Things may have changed since this time as politics in the Ming Dynasty change just as much as they do within Dai Viet, but we are keen on being seen as a reputable and trustworthy diplomatic partner in this regard. Whether it's being a faithful subject or a benevolent overlord to other tributaries, we of Dai Viet know what a master-apprentice or a liege-subject relationship entails; let us never dishonor such relationships without proper reasoning."
 engineering_of_ho_nguyen_trung: "Engineering Inside Dai Viet"
 engineering_of_ho_nguyen_trung_desc: "We have a recent legacy with firearms both big and small and part of it comes from the likes of Ho Nguyen Trung (born in 1374). He attempted to defend Dai Ngu from the Ming Dynasty in the past and contributed to the manufacture of early 'eruptor cannons' as well as other firearms within our own lands. Despite him living out the rest of his life in exile in service of the Ming Dynasty, the legacy of firearms especially with regards to siege-oriented ones is something we will always try to live up to."
 grounded_neo_confucian_outlook: "Grounded within Confucianism"
 grounded_neo_confucian_outlook_desc: "Whilst we have a very long history with Buddhism as well as various other influences from old beliefs and even Hindu-oriented traditions, Confucian influences stream into Dai Viet from the north at a constant rate. It's becoming more and more prominent in Dai Viet as time goes on and we are seeing the fruits of this come about in our administration. Less Buddhist temples (like pagodas) are being built and fewer pieces of land are being granted to Buddhists in general, whereas we are seeing a stronger emphasis on education through helping people learn to read and write before studying regular subjects like mathematics or geography."
 foreigners_are_beneath_dai_viet: "Shun the Foreigners"
 foreigners_are_beneath_dai_viet_desc: "Though we are not immune to foreigners, we do hold them as distinctly secondary to those at the heart of Dai Viet: the Vietnamese people themselves. Whether they are Lao, Chinese, Cham, Khmer, or some other foreign culture altogether, the Vietnamese people and their way of conducting both religious and political matters will be enshrined as unique and above others. Though we may have some traits like those surrounding us, we will never be exactly like them and neither can they be exactly like us."
 the_arts_of_dai_viet_flourish: "Artistic Explorations"
 the_arts_of_dai_viet_flourish_desc: "After being freed from the Chinese in 1427, the spark of artistic exploration was slow in how it came back to life. Thankfully though, it is due to our policies and efforts on all fronts that our own people are once more reaching out into the artistic world to explore what they can do once again. Artistic forms like hat tuong (a form of Vietnamese opera), cheo (a form of satirical musical theatre), and ca tru (a form of musical storytelling done by a female vocalist) are all being attempted and refined in more than just a few towns and cities. This development of our culture over time is something to be celebrated; it separates us from the rest of the surrounding states and puts us on our own shining pedestal."
 expansion_of_the_confucian_examinations: "Testing is now in Session"
 expansion_of_the_confucian_examinations_desc: "Late 1426 saw a small Confucian examiniation held in Dong Kinh by Le Loi. Though small in scope, it set a precedent going forward to continue having Confucian-like examiniations so that the administration of Dai Viet could have a strong set of educated officials to work with. As we grow as a state with more aspects to worry about, we will need to expand these examinations over time to encompass more towns and more provinces. Thus, the more educated officials at the disposal of Dai Viet, the better off the state will be with regards to it's functions in every respect."

#Khmer Ideas#
 at_our_very_end_we_still_fight: "Pushed to the Edge"
 at_our_very_end_we_still_fight_desc: "Time and time again our state has been pushed back by revolts, invasions, internal strife, and even natural disasters that stormed across our land. The worst of it was perhaps the Fall of Angkor in 1431 wherein Ponhea Yat fled and had to establish a new capital at Phnom Penh. In these bloody and sorrowful memories of our past, there is a solid notion that we should take to heart: Khmer people and those of the state itself will never give in to the enemy no matter how bad it gets. Our glorious capital may fall into ruins, but the spirit and people will always live on."
 we_are_no_devarajas: "Lack of Divine Blood"
 we_are_no_devarajas_desc: "Though Hinduism has had a very long history in these lands of ours, it is clear that traditional Hindu notions of society and authority are no longer what is right for Khmer. Our past rulers recognized this after the transition from Hinduism to Buddhism in the middle of the 1300s and with that transition came the fall of the idea that our ruler was a god-king, or, a devaraja. In doing this, our rulers are more human than some others around us; they can relate to the common people more so and are more humble than surrounding rulers most of the time. In continuing this more human view of the ruler, we will ensure a more concrete connection to the Khmer people."
 retake_the_river_trade: "The Issue of Mekong River Trade"
 retake_the_river_trade_desc: "The decline of our state has led to the rise of Lan Xang in the north and the growth of Thai power in the west, though the former is what threatens our heartland most in terms of monetary value. The Lao of Lan Xang actively attempt to hinder our trade efforts downstream through incursions and backroom deals, yet we still control the southern part of the Mekong River which is most vital. If we can continue to capitalize on our core region of the Mekon River and promote growth around it via markets and safe villages, we will be able to claw back what power was taken from us by Lan Xang."
 lacking_in_firearms_but_not_elephants: "Warfare in the Wetlands"
 lacking_in_firearms_but_not_elephants_desc: "The humid air of the region makes for less than ideal travel conditions, let alone conditions for using firearms. Though there are periods of time when it is dry enough to use firearms, we know that these are few and far between when compared to places like the Indian Subcontinent or mainland China. Thus the armies of Khmer and other nearby states still rely on elephants to do much of the heavy lifting and cavalry charges, and we are more than ready to continue to use massive elephant charges against our foes in any region."
 the_thai_khmer_rivalry: "The Rivalry Continues"
 the_thai_khmer_rivalry_desc: "We will never forget what the Thai have done to us in their destruction of our power and our formerly glorious capital at Angkor. Despite our losses and setbacks time and time again, we can still fight and make things right once more by retaking what belongs to us and putting all surrounding people groups in their proper place: subservient to Khmer. Let this fire that burns in us to bring justice for past transgressions never die out!"
 rekindle_those_long_lost_trade_ties: "Lost Trade Ties, Renewed"
 rekindle_those_long_lost_trade_ties_desc: "Previous centuries saw our glorious state connected to old states in the south like Srivijaya and Majapahit, but just as those states decayed into fractured realms fighting for old titles and glory, so to did our realm. Once we regain our footing and are able to assert military and economic dominance in our own lands, we should look to rekindle the trade ties in the south that we valued so much in the past."
 concentrated_effort_to_rebound: "Back from the Brink!"
 concentrated_effort_to_rebound_desc: "There is no doubt in the mind of any ruler from Lan Xang, Dai Viet, Sukhothai, or Ayutthaya that the lands we hold are very valuable with regards to fertility, strategy, and diplomacy, but to hold it down would mean dismantling most parts of the state we are culivating at this very moment. They could not do it before and they will not do it anytime soon as we are growing stronger than ever before thanks to our recent efforts. It has been a long and tumultuous road so far, but it was all worth it in the end as we are seeing the fruits of that labor come about day by day, month by month, and year by year."

#Oman Ideas#
 temporal_spiritual_imam_authority: "The Imams of Oman"
 temporal_spiritual_imam_authority_desc: "Ibadi Islam has a fiery history that dates all the way back to the Muhakkima, one of the supporters  of Ali in the First Fitna (though they later revoked this support). Ibn Ibad's teachings that were developed later by Jabir ibn Zayd helped form the theological basis by which the first Ibadi state would be established in Hadhramaut, but after it failed during the Umayyad Caliphate, Ibadi teachings settled in Oman in the mid to late 700s. Part of the basis for Ibadi Islam that is quite different from other branches is that the imam that leads the people (and has control over spiritual and temporal matters) is to be elected, not divinely chosen. Granted this is not easy to do for Oman today, we do try to stick to the initial and guiding teachings of Ibadi Islam."
 contesting_south_arabian_trade: "South Arabian Shootouts"
 contesting_south_arabian_trade_desc: "There are very valuable trade ports that have been utilized for centuries across the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. There are a few key trade goods found here that valued by various people ranging from Catholics to Hindus and many others, meaning they must come to either us or any number of other polities on the coast for business. What this also means is that we need look toward cutting down the other polities on the coast leading down to Yemen so that they do not infringe on our trade deals. Let the musket fire ring out across the deserts!"
 azd_nabhani_hinawi_ghafiri_tribes: "Maintain Omani Authority"
 azd_nabhani_hinawi_ghafiri_tribes_desc: "There are a great deal of tribal connections throughout Oman, let alone the entirety of the Arabian Peninsula. From the Azd to the Nabhani, and from the Hinwai to the Ghafiri, these tribes seek political authority and autonomy within Oman as time goes by, but we need to make sure their demands do not throw the state into chaos. Maintaining a firm grip on power through diplomacy and military force if need be is what is going to keep Omani lands safe and sound."
 defending_muscat: "Through Muscat, Oman Lives"
 defending_muscat_desc: "For centuries Muscat has been known as a valuable trade port and it has attracted both mercantile and political attention from beyond the Arabian Peninsula on multiple occasions. Whilst we have arid lands to help us stave off invasions across land, we do need to work toward building up a more potent fleet of ships to defend Muscat as well as all the coastal territories Oman claims. Muskets, cannons, and new ship designs will all help us reach this goal of an powerful yet efficient Omani trade fleet."
 with_agriculture_comes_naval_pwoer: "Invest into Coastal Villages"
 with_agriculture_comes_naval_pwoer_desc: "We can't help but focus on the coastal dwellings of Oman since beyond them lies the arid desert sands; they don't provide much for us as of right now. If we can invest money toward agricultural and infrastructure opportunities (like qanats for usable fresh water) in coastal communities though, we are likely to see a distinct rise in both our population and our capabilitiy to exert power elsewhere."
 arabian_and_african_ports: "Living on the Coasts"
 arabian_and_african_ports_desc: "It isn't just in South Arabia that people seek coastal communities for more opportunity and stability. Places such as Mogadishu, Zanzibar, Bahrain, Aden, and several others have this trend that Oman has experienced as well over several generations, meaning that they are all ripe for being apart of a more connected oceanic trade network. As of now many of the significant costal towns are outside of Oman's grasp, but our merchants and ships will arrive soon enough for both business and diplomacy."
 troops_and_ships_hand_in_hand: "Together as One!"
 troops_and_ships_hand_in_hand_desc: "Extending Oman's influence to all these coastal towns and villages means there needs to be a military and navy to back it all up. Whilst our ships and sailors have been our pride and joy for generations now, we should start to include a more formalized military to go along with the Omani navy. If both the coming military and the current navy can efficiently work together as a single unit, keeping control of our extensive state will be much easier."

#Hejaz and Medina Ideas#
 sacred_are_the_two_cities: "The Two Hearts of Islam"
 sacred_are_the_two_cities_desc: "Mecca and Medina, the two places by which all Muslims far and wide must attempt to make a pilgrimage to at some point in their life if possible. Though the external politics of the Arabian Peninsula are constantly shifting around us, we sharifs of Mecca and protectors of Medina will continue to guard the cities for the faithful Muslims across the world. It is a duty that is pious in nature, prestigious to others, and at times bloody in what must be done."
 between_sunni_and_shiites: "Religious Power Shifts"
 between_sunni_and_shiites_desc: "The history of these two holy cities of ours has not always been stable since religious conflict between sects of Islam arose after the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs passed on. Part of these conflicts were between Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims wherein for a time, the Sulayhids of Yemen controlled Mecca and appointed Shiite emirs to rule the holy city. Though this time period of religious struggles around Mecca and Medina is mostly over, we must still remember to welcome Muslims from every sect into these holy cities not just for taxation, but also to continue to be recognized as a pious leader by all Muslims."
 cooperation_with_outside_authorities: "Cooperation for Prosperity"
 cooperation_with_outside_authorities_desc: "Guardians of Mecca and Medina are we, though we have been subjected to the whims of outside powers too such as the Sulayhids of Yemen, the Ayyubids of Egypt, and Mamluk Sultanate as well. In being the subject of various powers, the families that watch over Mecca and Medina know very well how to work with foreign powers so as to maintain peace across the Hejaz area. Religious affiliations aside, the great many external powers that hail us as sharifs know that it would be unwise to try to uproot and replace what we have cultivated for centuries now."
 from_hasan_ibn_ali_are_we: "Descendants of Hasan ibn Ali"
 from_hasan_ibn_ali_are_we_desc: "To be qualified as a sharif in the first place, you must be a descendant in some way of Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad himself. In having this sanctified blood running through the veins of our rulers, there is very little doubt that we should and will continue to be the custodians of these two holy cities. Mecca and Medina are in a sense outside of the normal political shifts that occur in places like Mosul, Basra, Muscat, or Tehran; these cities must be preserved by those of a sayyid lineage (meaning they must be actual descendants of the prophet Muhammad)."
 money_from_pilgrims: "Steady Money from Pilgrims"
 money_from_pilgrims_desc: "It isn't easy funding every part of our state with just the usual taxation from land owners and such; the land of Hedjaz is arid and trade along the Red Sea brings in only so much money. That is why taxes on faithful pilgrims coming to make fulfill their holy duty by undertaking the Hajj will help ensure that we do not run out of money in the future. It isn't just for lavish projects and such, as the pilgrims should already know; we do employ a military that needs to defend these lands from raiders and brigands seeking to extort innocent villages and travelers."
 strides_into_political_matters: "Cross the Political Barriers"
 strides_into_political_matters_desc: "Traditionally we have been reluctant to get involved in political matters outside of the Arabian Peninsula what with the Ayyubids, Fatimids, Seljuks, and even the Mamluks dealing with matters that don't really impact those of the Hejaz area. The Mamluks started to do things differently, however, and they began to involve us more and more into politics outside of our traditional home territory, meaning we are coming into contact with a great deal of foreign states our ancestors could only dream of. As both positive and negative attention comes toward the Hejaz area, we must seek out more determined defenders of the holy cities, those driven to keep unwanted invaders from encroaching into our lands as our influence slowly begins to spread."
 potential_for_caliphate_status: "Caliphate Ambitions"
 potential_for_caliphate_status_desc: "In the time of Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far (994-1038), he was proclaimed (counter-)caliph with the help of a former Fatimid vizier to oppose the Fatimid Caliphate. It did not last long as the support beneath the would-be caliph ran out in the very same year he was proclaimed, but these memories remain strong within our state to this very day. We are of sayyid blood as it is and the old Fatimid Caliphate is long gone alongside the Abbasid Caliphate, meaning the position is effectively vacant for now. Should we garner enough power, prestige, and territory to assert both religious and political authority across more than just the Arabian Peninsula, we might just be able to claim the title of 'caliphate' once and for all."

#Byzantium Ideas, the Forbidden
 making_do_with_what_we_have: "To Make Do"
 making_do_with_what_we_have_desc: "What remains of our once glorious empire... Fragments all scattered throughout like a foundation in tatters. Yet, all is not lost! These scattered places of Byzantine strength working as bastions of our prowess and prestige are still capable hubs for attracting ferocious mercenaries and docking our ships. If we are to rebuild back to what we once were, we are going to need to rely on both mercenaries and our navy alike."
 stopping_the_supply_shortages: "Robust Logistical Oversight"
 stopping_the_supply_shortages_desc: "In previous skirmishes and battles that saw our eventual decay before the rising Ottoman Empire, logistics were a key issue that our military faced. In trying to address our military pitfalls, organizing supply lines to moving armies as well as just how supplies are brought to our defensive fortifications will greatly improve the quality of our armies over time."
 from_an_economic_abyss: "Economic Abyss No More"
 from_an_economic_abyss_desc: "As one might expect, a decaying empire losing ground to stronger and stronger enemies is going to see economic turmoil wash over it. We have already been through such turmoil unfortunately, but now that we have the lessons of the past with us and experience going through such economic woes, we can improve our finances through taxes and trade to better reflect our empire's actual glory."
 militant_like_the_komnenos: "Militant like the Komnenoi"
 militant_like_the_komnenos_desc: "Though long gone now, the age of the Komnenoi saw a massive overhaul of the army of Byzantium. The traditional composition was done away with due to massive losses at Manzikert and Dyrrachion and instead a new army was composed made of more disciplined and professional contingents like the vestiaritai, the vardariotai, and the archontopouloi. Looking back to this time of restructuring in the military gives us not only a solid foundation to look back upon but also an example to replicate through various means; it won't be easy to build up a disciplined and professional military once again, but it will be worth it!"
 learning_from_the_angeloi: "Learn from the Angeloi"
 learning_from_the_angeloi_desc: "The reign of the Angeloi was... Turbulent, to say the least. Under the reign of Isaac II, Alexios III, Alexios IV, and Alexios V, the entire realm was consumed by fires both internally and externally which led to the formation of the Latin Empire and the Empire of Nicaea alongside other petty states. Though we are whole once again thanks to the righteous efforts of the Michael VIII, we must still thoroughly scour the archives and learn as much as we can from the era of the Angeloi."
 glorious_like_the_palaiologos: "Glory be to the Palaiologoi"
 glorious_like_the_palaiologos_desc: "Despite the issues of the Ottoman Empire pressing against us at all points throughout their rise to power, we refuse to give in to their demands for land, wealth, and influence! The Palaiologoi are not just meant for restoring the empire through recapturing Constantinople and some other scattered lands, no, they are meant for much greater things! Through staunch efforts from every part of Byzantium, we will rise to glory and strive for a righteous retaking of what is rightfully ours. It can thus be said that the 'Palaiologos Restoration' is well and truly upon us."
 pieces_of_the_purple_puzzle: "Pieces of the Purple Puzzle"
 pieces_of_the_purple_puzzle_desc: "And as we continue our resistance to the Muslims and Catholics from both sides, we will retake what was once graced by the imperial touch of the Roman Empire itself. Macedonia, Anatolia, the Levant, and so many other places that were once under the auspices of the basileus will again feel the renewed vigor of a robust administration stemming from Constantinople. The road ahead will be filled with bloodshed, sweat, tears, and heartbreak on all sides, but for rebirth to happen, sacrifices must be made."

#Poland Ideas
 folwarks_through_and_through: "The Folwark System"
 folwarks_through_and_through_desc: "A nobleman's landholding in the Commonwealth is usually comprised of what we call a folwark. It is a large farm worked by various serfs to produce surpluses for trade that is both internal and external. So long as we can keep this system functional and perhaps reform the laws surrounding it over time, the folwark system will continue to contribute great amounts to our trade routes and our stockpiles."
 rememberance_of_the_piasts: "Lasting Piast Influence"
 rememberance_of_the_piasts_desc: "The Piast Dynasty, in our own tradition, under Mieszko I founded the first Polish state via his conversion to Christianity in April of 966. His successors did well to craft a unique kingdom near the fringe of Central Europe, though the Piasts fell on hard times during multiple generations. Despite all of the revolts, devolutions of central power, and invasions from foreign powers like the Bohemians and the Mongols, the Polish state survived in some distinct form. It is their grit, their will, and their devotion to the survival of our culture and state that runs through the veins of every Pole today. Let us never forget their legacy."
 liberties_of_the_szlachta_on_display: "Entice Foreign Nobility"
 liberties_of_the_szlachta_on_display_desc: "Polish szlachta (our equivalent to a noble) have exercised considerable influence in Polish politics ever since the latter part of the Piast Dynasty's reign. After the reunification of Poland through Wladyslaw the Elbow-high and Casimir III in the 1300s, compromises with various noble families within Poland led to them being where they are now: a powerful force within not only the rural parts of our state but also the royal court itself. Such power and compromise is understandably making foreign nobility jealous to some degree; if they want to visit for a while to see how we do things, why not let them?"
 from_lancers_to_hussars: "Toward the Hussar"
 from_lancers_to_hussars_desc: "The days of light cavalry raiding enemy settlements and helping skirmish with our main armies are coming to an end, unfortunately. There are still roles for cavalry as the field of battle evolves ever more, but we must choose how exactly we want to shape our own cavalry ranks. Part of our military, however, is already leaning into the idea of a power of newly equipped heavier versions of the old light cavalry we used to employ. Such hussars, as they are starting to be known as, seem to be the perfect blend of armor and speed whilst also being able to deal serious damage to enemy ranks in full."
 a_military_worth_standing_with: "Stretching Every Resource"
 a_military_worth_standing_with_desc: "The Polish state of the Piast Dynasty did not stretch that far in terms of total land area meaning that a standing army for them was far less of a concern. We are very different in this new era, however, and we must think about trying to modernize our military routinely as the age of feudal levies falls ever more into the past. Having patrols on major roads, guarded walls around crucial centers, and a solid force of defenders for capital defense alone are just some of the basic needs that can be fulfilled if we work toward having a serious standing army of some kind, one that isn't so reliant on serfs."
 political_philosophy_encouraged: "Think, Debate, Write, Publish"
 political_philosophy_encouraged_desc: "The szlachta may be thorns in our side at times and gracious gifts from the heavens at others, but one thing that has resulted from their increased influence and autonomy within our state is that they are thinking of new political and military ideas routinely. Whether it is for their own good, for the good of a friend, or simply because they have money and power and want to use it somehow, these influential manuscripts and papers that our szlachta publish should be spread around our royalty at once!"
 the_music_flows_forth: "Cultural Guests, Welcome!"
 the_music_flows_forth_desc: "The courts of our szlachta and the royal court as well house the potential to bring in a variety of artisans of various trades from different parts of Europe. It is thanks to our efforts in both the political and cultural realm that we can attract famous artists, composers, philosophers, theologians, astronomers, and even capable commanders. In time, as we treat these guests with hospitality and engage in fanciful yet influential talks with them, we will spread the word of just how prestigious the courts of Poland truly are."

#Qing Ideas
 eight_banners_for_three_divisons: "Eight Banners for Three Divisions"
 eight_banners_for_three_divisons_desc: "There traditionally have been banners that functioned as armies for our people, yet as we have grown to encompass so many more people groups, the need for more banners that utilize more people groups is at hand. Creating eight more banners for the two other principle people groups of our realm, the Han and the Mongols, will allow us to field many more core regiments of soldiers that are not just regular recruits with basic training. These banners will form the elite core of the Qing Dynasty going forward and they will march forth gloriously into the fires of war wherever they may be."
 succeed_the_great_jin: "Succeed the Great Jin"
 succeed_the_great_jin_desc: "In the times of old, our ancestors carved out a grandiose state for themselves through the rebellion of Wanyan Aguda against the Liao Dyansty. After dismantling the Liao Dynasty, those of Great Jin pursued several wars against the Song Dynasty wherein they ultimately came to a stalemate yet they proved to all others just how strong the Jurchens of the north could be. We must emulate the strength and the unity that those of Great Jin achieved, for if we can do so, we will be able to stand up to any outside or inside threat."
 absorb_old_ming_scholars_and_academies: "Embrace the Old Literati"
 absorb_old_ming_scholars_and_academies_desc: "We must not tarnish and destroy all that the Ming Dynasty built up in terms of scientific and philosophic discovery. They have achieved many great things that are now foundational to our military, administration, trade sector, and even our naval vessels. Embracing such scholarly gentry (otherwise known as literati) into the folds of the Qing Dynasty will give us a solid foundation for future research endeavors in any sector we deem fit."
 establishing_the_green_standard: "The Green Standard Army"
 establishing_the_green_standard_desc: "Defectors from the crumbling Ming Dynasty and the outcasts of society, they are potential bandits and brigands amidst everyday folk doing business in the Qing Dynasty. Instead of cracking down on them with fines or imprisonment, we should recruit them into the military and give them an actual occupation they are paid for, even if it is being a guard for a small village. Brigands and bands of thieves will find their numbers shrinking whilst our military numbers steadily rise over time as we get these downtrodden folks equipped with basic weaponry, training, and a livable wage."
 calligraphy_and_painting_of_the_gentry: "Scholarly Gentry Flourishing"
 calligraphy_and_painting_of_the_gentry_desc: "Not only do the literati of the Qing Dynasty the past with the present in terms of scientific breakthroughs and philosophical thinking, they also strive to create new works of art that utilize both older styles and newer techniques. Such cultural flourishing is readily embraced within our administration and we only wish to promote it through the patronage of more calligraphers, painters, sculptors, and musicians."
 crack_down_on_corrupt_silver_economics: "Breathe Life into Anti-Corruption"
 crack_down_on_corrupt_silver_economics_desc: "More and more we are seeing that silver is being used instead of other currencies as the flow of silver within the markets across our neighbors and our own is increasing with every passing month. Our financiers and merchants are ready to accept the transition toward silver as a standard currency, but we must be ready to cut down excesses gained through corrupt means with this new currency since it is not minted into a regulated coin like the standard copper coins of the past. Once we have a strong handle on the trading of silver in our own markets, we will be able to work the global market in a far better way."
 provincial_bureaucracy_to_the_viceroy: "The Making of New Viceroys"
 provincial_bureaucracy_to_the_viceroy_desc: "Administration within our state, the Qing Dynasty, is just as orderly as the Ming Dynasty was. Indeed we have taken up where our old rivals left off in terms of how provinces and prefectures are governed, but the position of 'viceroy' or 'governor-general' of various regions is something that is a bit more novel. Promoting this position as our empire expands and sectioning our lands into distinct, recognizable provinces for the viceroys to govern will allow for a much more streamlined system to work with."

#Yuan ideas
 succeed_the_earth_stop_the_fire: "Succeed the Earth; Stop the Fire"
 succeed_the_earth_stop_the_fire_desc: "In the tradition of the Five Elements, we of the Yuan Dynasty take up the element of metal which is symbolized by the color white. Though some question our decision to go with metal due to the fact that they see the Song Dynasty as the actual dynasty that came before us, we know that the true precursor to us was the Jin Dynasty, the one that chose earth as its elemental symbol. Metal succeeds earth just as we are to succeed the Jurchen Jin Dynasty and as time goes on, we will work to stop what traditionally curtails metal in the tradition of the Five Elements: fire. Wherever that firey inferno may come from, we will snuff it out and have the world bow to the might of the white banners."
 to_tempt_the_empowered_military_nobles: "A Daring Gamble"
 to_tempt_the_empowered_military_nobles_desc: "In the times of Kublai Khan, Temur Khan, and the following successors, military nobles that were granted fiefs appanages with serfs saw themselves as empowered by the government itself. They were not curtailed in any major sense and thus grew to have a troubled relationship with future leaders of the dynasty. We are similar in how militarized our society is compared to our ancestors and also how divided into social classes our land can be, thus making us lean into trusting the military nobles like before for both internal control and external influence. These nobles can be the source of great tension in our future, yet we will learn from how our ancestors fell and succeed in this precarious sector."
 the_new_keshig_and_suwei_with_gunpowder: "Keshig and Suwei, Reformed"
 the_new_keshig_and_suwei_with_gunpowder_desc: "The old ways of the Keshig and Suwei are being forgotten amongst various military leaders within our state, yet the archives detail just how effective the old organization and tactics were if the proper soldiers and attention were around. Let us take those dusty old manuscripts and tomes and combine the knowledge they possess with the technology of today and work to combine the traditions of the Keshig and Suwei with gunpowder weapons. We can be even more fearsome than our ancestors if we adapt these deadly weapons into various formations, strategies, and organizational units."
 medicinal_knowledge_expanded_upon: "Medicinal Explorations"
 medicinal_knowledge_expanded_upon_desc: "Medicine is but a small part of scientific innovations, that much is true, but during the time of the Kublai Khan and his successors, medicine and its limits were explored thoroughly and some significant advances were made back then that we still use today. If we subsidize the work our current physicians do and allow them to explore new avenues of research with various herbs, spices, plants, and possibly even minerals if they deem it necessary, we could see breakthroughs that benefit not only the peasantry or clerical class, but also the royalty as well!"
 systematic_firearms_production: "Supply Chains for Firearms"
 systematic_firearms_production_desc: "In the midst of the older Yuan Dynasty, the production of firearms and gunpowder was systematic to some degree, but it was not as refined as it could be. The administration had a variety of other things to focus on and streamlining the production of military equipment was fairly low on the list of things to do. Now that we are back and better than ever, we should pick up where the Yuan Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty left off in the heart of the Middle Kingdom; going forward, we will become a grand center for the production of firearms and gunpowder!"
 compromise_of_the_state_but_still_different: "Know the Differences and Similarities"
 compromise_of_the_state_but_still_different_desc: "An empire like our own cannot run every single area and region as if they were like the capital of the empire, where laws are as strict and orderly as can be. In essence, we must compromise on several topics with various regional people groups which our ancestors did to a great degree too. Mixing elements of Chinese bureaucracy with military administration alongside clericl functions and perhaps even dividing things along ethnic or tribal lines when needed is going to mean we get the most out of our people no matter where they are. If our ancestors could do as such and still prosper, so to can we."
 yuan_bureaus_provinces_and_divisions: "The Bureaus and Divisions"
 yuan_bureaus_provinces_and_divisions_desc: "We may seem like a fairly sinicized dynasty to outsiders if they just look at our labels, but beneath the labels is a living and breathing legal framework and insitutional network that spans across vast stretchs of people and land. Taking key notes from the Yuan Dynasty of old like having the traditional triple division of authority (civil, military, and censorial), a Central Secretariat, a Privy Council, and even including a new and reformed Ministry of Justice, we are quickly approaching the administrative expertise with which our ancestors once governed. In time, we will even surpass them as our empire continues to grow in all avenues and we learn to both reshape and reform our administrative ranks."

#Mongol Empire Ideas
 MGE_ideas: "Great Mongol Ideas"
 MGE_ideas_start: "Great Mongol Traditions"
 MGE_ideas_bonus: "Great Mongol Ambition"
 surrender_through_words_or_by_force: "Through Words or by Force"
 surrender_through_words_or_by_force_desc: "We know we will get our way, it just is a matter of time and for people to choose what path they go down. They may try to resist and put up a fight against our plethora of cavalry, but in the end it will be of no use when they see just how massive our military can be in conjunction with coordinated attacks, defenses, and overall movements across a wide variety of terrains. One way or another they will surrender their land and their prosperity to us."
 a_military_of_scaling_meritocracy: "Meritocratic Ranks"
 a_military_of_scaling_meritocracy_desc: "Much like how the start of the Mongol Empire had part of its origins in a meritocratic military structure, we too will emulate this across our entire military. Your ancestry means nothing in the ranks of the keshig or any other part of our military if you cannot back up said ancestry with skill and prowess. From the basics of knowing how to ride a horse and knowing basic self-defense to more advanced aspects like being able shoot accurately whilst riding at full gallop or knowing how to execute and orderly retreat, we will refine the quality of our infantry, cavalry, and artillery alike."
 kurultai_with_new_politics_in_play: "The New Kurultai"
 kurultai_with_new_politics_in_play_desc: "We have learned much sense the passing of our ancestral empire into history; it's rebirth, however, allows for reforms to take place all across the spectrum. One such place where we will implement reforms is the kurultai, the traditional meeting to decide who the next khan of the entire empire. Whilst previously it proved to be somewhat draining on our expansionist leadership due to being held in one singular place between all subordinate khans and such, we will work to have it be more flexible in location and time whilst also being more focused on the quality of the next in line to rule alongside the quality of the advisors."
 resistance_begets_nothing_but_tears_and_bones: "Resistance Begets Nothing"
 resistance_begets_nothing_but_tears_and_bones_desc: "Let it be known that when there is resistance to us in the form of uprisings or foreigners refusing to surrender and instead opting to fight us in a war of some kind, there will be nothing but bones, ashes, and the tears of the survivors left when we are done. In large part we are content with seeing the fields of those who oppose us go up in flames; the foolish defenders ruthlessly cut down; and captured sympathizers made out to be examples to others."
 ideas_of_math_and_astronomy_spread: "By Math; By Astronomy"
 ideas_of_math_and_astronomy_spread_desc: "The heavens have much in the way of knowledge, but so much of it is hidden from us! So many of us are concerned with expansion, plunder, diplomacy, taxation, trade, recruitment, and a plethora of other matters that are important in their own right, but we should never forget just how far the subjects of math and astronomy can go in benefitting the entire empire. More precise calculations for engineering, more accurate measurements for the stars above so we can better nail down equinoxes and such, both of these aspects and more are the results of funding mathematics and astronomy. Perhaps we might even glimpse into parts of our own future if enough research is funded!"
 feared_like_no_other: "Let them Hate, as long as they Fear"
 feared_like_no_other_desc: "People can hate us as long as they want; various dukes, rajas, shahs, emirs, barons, whoever they are, all of them can resent us if they so choose, we cannot control their thoughts. What we can control, though, is how much fear we exude and how intimidating we are to outsiders and those inside our borders. Our methods may be cruel to some, but knowing the true value of fear and using it to its greatest extent will be a guiding principle for us."

#Deccan Ideas
 the_beating_heart_of_the_subcontinent: "The Beating Heart"
 the_beating_heart_of_the_subcontinent_desc: "We of the Deccan are stationed in the heart of the entire subcontinent and we have inherited a plethora of good and bad things to deal with. It isn't enough to just observe the Deccan on the surface and barely investigate what goes on in the various towns and cities; we must instead be willing to get our hands a little dirty working with and learning about the various people that make up our state. Whether they are Muslims of Iranian descent, followers of Jainism that are minding their own business, or even Brahmins that are working on their own behalf, we must account for them in our spreadsheets and documents and hear them out on what concerns they have."
 the_marathas_situation: "Dealing with the Marathas"
 the_marathas_situation_desc: "Despite our best efforts to rectify local issues between religious and cultural communities throughout the Deccan, one persistent issue that is divided along cultural lines is that of the Marathas. They are not mere peasants blindly following our administration; they know their illustrious history and just how powerful they as a people group can be if they are unified enough. It is this brewing unrest in the more remote Marathas communities that we must put down through either diplomatic compromises or military authority. In dealing with these internal issues, we can and will learn about how our forces can do better defending and attacking within the confines of the Deccan as a whole."
 economics_of_hyderabad: "Economics of the Deccan"
 economics_of_hyderabad_desc: "The times of the past where agriculture and taxation formed the majority of the income for a state are slowly going away. More and more we are seeing foreign ships come to the shores of our glorious state to do business; they speak of places like Paris, London, Lisbon, Valencia, Tunis, and many other places wishing to have more of the various textiles we produce in large quantities with the utmost quality. In accordance with this growing trade sector of ours, we should be looking into how to maximize our profits from trade centers on our coast instead of relying solely on taxation for upwards of more than half of our revenue."
 know_how_foreigners_fight: "Studying Abroad"
 know_how_foreigners_fight_desc: "With these foreigners coming to our land for trade, they bring with them tales of their own land and how they do combat. Bloody wars in regions across Europe and Africa breed new tactics over time which our military has been particularly keen in studying for themselves. Maybe if we can set up an 'officer exchange' program of sorts with one or more European states, we can start to study how exactly they fight skirmishes and pitched battles."
 a_palace_with_jewels_fit_for_it: "Jewels from Hyderabad"
 a_palace_with_jewels_fit_for_it_desc: "The precious gems mined our of Hyderabad and other places throughout the Deccan are some of the finest the world has ever seen. Not only this, but our work to develop our capital and establish it as a place where a proper and illustrious ruler can exercise power from has been going very well so far. Hyderabad is one of the most developed cities in the entirety of the subcontinent at this point and as such it is ripe for making an impact of foreign diplomats and envoys that make visits to us."
 new_industries_rising_up_in_the_deccan: "Oversee New Industries"
 new_industries_rising_up_in_the_deccan_desc: "The rise of Hyderabad as a wealthy city that can project its power throughout so many parts of the Deccan and beyond means that other cities are following its lead. Places like Ujjain, Bidar, and Delhi are attempting to emulate the example of Hyderabad and are seeing the rise of various new industries that draw upon the expertise of many individuals and require new technologies to be sustained. We must not get in the way of this urban progression if we are to keep our place on the world stage; we should be encouraging these new industries as much as we can!"
 maintain_an_internal_focus: "Our Work is Never Done"
 maintain_an_internal_focus_desc: "We may think that someday the Deccan will be a stable, sustainable state that will have very little issues running on its own with little guidance from the royal family, but this notion is entirely untrue. A state is never 'finished' in any sense; the empires and states of the past, like the Gupta Empire or the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, are clear examples of this. Thus, if we are to continue to be successful as a state governing the beating heart of the subcontinent, we must never take our eyes off the internal matters that consistently shift around from day to day, week to week, and month to month. Answers to our problems lay not beyond our borders, but rather they lay inside, like a puzzle that is never quite solved."

#Roman Empire Ideas
 pretenders_put_to_rest: "Putting Foolish Ambitions to Rest"
 pretenders_put_to_rest_desc: "There have been pretenders to the legacy of the once great Roman Empire of the past, yet its fracturing and degradation due to a myriad of problems meant that others could try to usurp the once glorious title. Finally these pretenders are no more! Without a shadow of a doubt we have reclaimed the imperial legacy and brought the glory from the past to the present! All within and outside of Europe will know this to be true whether they like it or not!"
 reformation_of_roman_provinces: "Imperial and Senatorial Provinces"
 reformation_of_roman_provinces_desc: "The borders of past Roman provinces (both imperial and senatorial ones) were lacking in their administrative strategy as it disregarded geography and the people groups living in various places, meaning internal tensions in various provinces could easily break out and the bureaucracy would struggle to handle it. We can remake these provinces alongside actual geographic and cultural lines though since we have a much more in-depth understanding of the land than our ancestors did."
 adaptable_legions_reborn: "Imperial Legions"
 adaptable_legions_reborn_desc: "Is there anything more iconic about our ancestors than the legions themselves? Truly they were a marvel for their time, but they were vulnerable to corruption and lapses in training due to how big the old empire was in conjunction with how autonomous legions could be. If we are to bring back the notion of legions within our own military today, we must take steps to centralize the military as a whole whilst also ensuring that our soldiers and commanders are ready for whatever threat comes their way."
 monumental_architecture_of_true_romans: "Roman Architecture, Reborn"
 monumental_architecture_of_true_romans_desc: "The old architecture of the Roman Empire still stands to this day in a variety of places. Some of these structures have been repurposed for modern usage whilst others have been left to be reclaimed by nature itself, but the fact that there is so much still around is a testament to just how impactful our ancestors were with buildings alone. By using modern materials and logistics in conjunction with old Roman stylings, we can ensure our buildings are both glorious and functional in more ways than one."
 efficient_engineering: "Roman Engineering, Revitalized"
 efficient_engineering_desc: "Few would ever doubt the ingenious engineering that the Roman Empire conducted throughout its time before being fractured. From bridges to aqueducts to siege weapons and more, our ancestors were true masters of engineering for their time period and it is up to us to live up that legacy. Through the construction of new structures that are meant for both civilian and military use, we will refine our artisans and engineers over time so that they can serve both economic and militaristic purposes."
 citizens_of_new_roman_empire: "Redefine the Roman Citizen"
 citizens_of_new_roman_empire_desc: "Actual full-blooded Roman citizens in the old empire were few and far between when compared to the population of non-Roman people. This made it so that there was a clear separation between how non-citizens and citizens though there was a slow process of 'Romanization' through the prospect of becoming a citizen over time. If we can reform this process and bring it under a sense of control throughout the entire empire as it stands today, we will be able to bring in more people to contribute to the economy and the military."
 casus_belli: "Casus Belli"
 casus_belli_desc: "Where there is land in the hands of those hostile to Rome, there will always be a case for war. Though foreign envoys may try to downplay the fact that their ruler may refuses Roman customs, traders, diplomats, or demands from us, we know the truth of it all. There is no need to hear it outright; there will always be an enemy of Rome near and far which necessitates the occasion for war."

#Holy Roman Empire Ideas
 era_of_the_empire: "A Holy and Roman Era Begins"
 era_of_the_empire_desc: "It has been centuries since the Holy Roman Empire was established, yet it has seen so much contention for power between estates, religious factions, and even potential emperors. From the times of Otto I to Frederick I and beyond, there has been very little peace in Central Europe despite the Holy Roman Empire on paper being able to resolve such conflicts, but that time is now officially over. Now we look to a new era, an era where Central Europe has a uniform military, administration, and trade sector that cannot be matched by the French, the English, nor the Italians or Iberians. Truly there will be none that can match us going forward."
 roman_ranks_reformed: "Like the Romans in our Ranks"
 roman_ranks_reformed_desc: "The Roman Empire of old was almost unmatched in the area of disciplined army strength and logistical prowess, but the decline over the course of the 200s to 400s meant that discipline fell and supply lines were increasingly put under stress. If there is one thing a unified Holy Roman Empire can work on first in the area of militarism, it is the logistics sector as we have plenty of roads to compound upon and also a plethora of fighting men ready to be organized into a cohesive set of regiments."
 lessons_on_imperial_diplomacy: "Child of Diplomacy"
 lessons_on_imperial_diplomacy_desc: "In a sense, our unified state can be said to be a product of diplomacy between states within the Holy Roman Empire. From Austria to Saxony and from Hesse to Bohemia, diplomacy between various parts of Central Europe was always in play somehow and we as a unified state rightfully emulate that legacy, but this time to other parts of the world. Whether our diplomats go to other European courts or to the gilded halls of East Asia, or even strange courts down in Africa or the Americas, there will always be a sense of imperial prestige and grandeur that follows."
 one_final_administration_above_all: "United We Stand"
 one_final_administration_above_all_desc: "The unification of the Holy Roman Empire is a monumental achievement in it of itself. To ensure that such an administration can handle the various matters that states like Austria, Saxony, or Bohemia struggled with is no small feat; our court has grown to encompass a huge amount of officials that few other courts would be able to compare to. Yet it is because of our efficient court and our expedient officials that we are able to handle all these governing tasks and more. Truly the empire embodies both quality and quantity unlike any other state within Europe!"
 north_to_south_trade_routes: "From North to South in Peace"
 north_to_south_trade_routes_desc: "Thanks to there being a unified state within Central Europe that stretches from the north to the south completely, there is very little in the way of brigands or bandits roaming between borders; we can effectively guard the trade routes with our own troops. It is because of this safety and the fact that traders can travel with great ease now throughout Central Europe that we are seeing more and more investors come to our cities like Hamburg, Vienna, and Nuremburg to make deals."
 control_over_the_estates_and_classes: "Concentrated Central Control"
 control_over_the_estates_and_classes_desc: "Previously there had been Free Cities, Bishoprics, Prince-Bishoprics, an Arch-Duchy, and various other statelets that claimed small titles within the Holy Roman Empire; each one allowed a certain estate or two to gain immense power and thus cause power shifts across entire regions. Now that there is no such government that allows such petty statelets to claim such independent titles, we can effectively exert more control over the clergy, middle class, and nobility overall no matter where they are or who they descend from."
 unparalleled_court_grandeur: "Like No Other"
 unparalleled_court_grandeur_desc: "Whilst Paris, London, Rome, and Constantinople may be able to attract astute and bright minds in their own right, it is only the Holy Roman Empire that can truly bring them all together in a grand capacity. Advisors speaking a wide variety of languages and hailing from different parts of our own empire and from across the world gather within our courts to present what they have to offer, knowing that we hold the legacy of so many powerful and prestigious states from before like Austria and Bohemia."

#Navarra Ideas
 divided_have_we_been: "Divided Without End"
 divided_have_we_been_desc: "Since the inception of a possibly independent state for Basque people, this land has been divided up between rival powers. Whether they were Muslims or Catholics, French of Castilian, or any other sort of contender for power in the region, they were routinely in contest for our land at some point. Let us make good on these attempts and try to play them off of each other when we can; perhaps forging dynastic alliances once more could net us a stronger base of power."
 memories_of_king_charles_ii: "Remember King Charles II"
 memories_of_king_charles_ii_desc: "Charles the Bad, reigning from 1349 to 1387 as King of Navarra, was a pivotal figure not only for Navarra but also for the English and the French in the Hundred Years' War. He switched sides at multiple points and attempted to further his own ambitions by playing to one side or the other in the war, though his ambitions were left unfulfilled in the end. It would be good for us to embody the more diplomatic side of Charles II's reign instead of his more cruel side since we could certainly use more connections and agents in foreign cities to inform us who we should fight for."
 lessons_of_the_navarrese_company: "The Old Navarrese Company"
 lessons_of_the_navarrese_company_desc: "The memories of the Navarrese Company are still recent in the minds of several nobles within our land. Formed initially under Charles II to go against Charles V of France, they were eventually organized to go eastward in the 1370s after the earnest recruiting efforts of Enguerrand VII of Coucy. With lances, mounted archers, and engineers at the ready, they performed very well as a mercenary company in the lands of the crumbling Byzantine Empire up until the 1380s. Their legacy rings through the streets of Navarra still to this very day in the mercenary contracts we take up and in the engineers we hire for both military and civilian uses."
 the_war_of_the_bands: "The War of the Bands"
 the_war_of_the_bands_desc: "troublesome are the nobility... So much so that they've been feuding throughout the late 1300s and into the early 1400s! Royal authority barely had an impact on them as repeatedly the nobles sought to sort their differences out through their own individual means; it wasn't until exterior powers came through to enforce some sort of law and order that they quieted down. Though some would see this as an excuse to crack down on them, we know that we can use these nobles and their entrenched identities to our advantage should we be on good terms with them. They can be very valuable informants for our administration should foreign powers be trying to make moves against us."
 re_establish_royal_authority: "Bring Back Royal Authority"
 re_establish_royal_authority_desc: "Though the War of the Bands is well and truly over, royal authority is still lacking in some of the more rural parts of our state due to the fact that the previously autonomous nobility were able to build their own quarters away from the peering eyes of our administration. We shoudl work to enlist more loyal officials and steadily expand our court in size in accordance with our expanding economy so that we can keep better track of these more rural areas; royal authority cannot and will not be evaded."
 entrenched_nobility_of_navarra: "The Entrenched Nobility"
 entrenched_nobility_of_navarra_desc: "And whilst we try to exercise control over the noble families of Navarra even more, we will not tear down the fortified settlements they've built up. Such works of stone and wood are useful in defending the land from foreign invaders or even stopping internal revolts from spreading. In time we might even start to emulate how our nobles have built up their strongholds so that we can have a more concrete defensive system."
 crossing_of_dynasties: "Footprints of Many Dynasties"
 crossing_of_dynasties_desc: "Despite us being a place where foreign dynasties sought to implant themselves to further the interests of the crowns of France, Castile, or Aragon, we have prospered somewhat by this influx of foreign influences and trade throughout Basque communities. Welcoming more foreign dynasties into our court and perhaps even marrying into some of them would keep Navarra's reputation afloat in this regard, and it would aid us in getting more powerful allies across Europe."

#East Frisia & Friesland Ideas
 frisian_ideas: "Frisian Ideas"
 frisian_ideas_start: "Frisian Traditions"
 frisian_ideas_bonus: "Frisian Ambition"
 fight_for_frisian_freedom: "Frisian Freedom!"
 fight_for_frisian_freedom_desc: "Unlike much of the rest of Europe, these marshy and swampy lands of ours are hard to govern since communities are far more spread out and we do not have large urban centers akin to Vienna, Paris, or Rome. This has led to a concept of 'Frisian Freedom' wherein governance is fairly decentralized and horizontal in its governing structure; there have been few if any families of great power akin to the nobles of the rest of Europe. We have not been able to stave off the advancing tide of feudalism forever, however, and it consistently encroaches on Frisian lands like the tide of the sea, but it is not unstoppable! We must never forget what freedom our ancestors had and we must always be ready to fight for it!"
 schieringers_versus_vetkopers: "Schieringers vs. Vetkopers"
 schieringers_versus_vetkopers_desc: "Factional politics arose throughout Frisia despite our history of Frisian Freedom. The Vetkopers and Schieringers are the prime suspects here and have stoked the flames of ongoing internal feuds and outright civil wars across the lands of Frisia (both in Friesland and East Frisia). Outside forces have sought to take advantage of the factionalism by allying with one faction or the other, yet this has proven to be unsuccessful time and time again as the other faction comes back in time when they are given the opportunity. No matter which side we end up going with, we can at the very least be sure we will ample leadership ready to serve our administration."
 continue_the_elections_of_the_potestaat: "The Position of Potestaat"
 continue_the_elections_of_the_potestaat_desc: "Freemen of Frisia have been able to elect local potestaats to serve as their elected representative, though rarely did any single potestaat have enough power to try to exert their control the entirety of Frisian lands. There has been one potestaat elected to lead Friesland (Juw Juwinga in 1396 by the Schieringers), but this did not stop the process of local potestaats from being elected afterwards, thus carrying forth the notion of a very horizontal governing structure. If we are to survive as an independent polity that respects its own people and traditions, we would do well to uphold the notion of potestaats for our state."
 let_them_fall_like_arnulf_of_holland: "Let them Fall like Arnulf!"
 let_them_fall_like_arnulf_of_holland_desc: "The foolishness of Arnulf, Count of Holland still rings as a clear example of the power of Frisian people and their will to maintain autonomy and independence. Despite Arnulf's attempt to proclaim himself as count of Oostergo and Westergo, the Frisians he did battle with resisted courageously and killed him in battle. With his death, Frisian Freedom can be said to have been secured for the first time. Truly it was a pivotal point in our history, one that gives our civilians and soldiers the vigor to resist any foreign army that attempts to subjugate us."
 supported_by_monasters_and_the_wealthy_alike: "Both Big and Small Contributions"
 supported_by_monasters_and_the_wealthy_alike_desc: "No matter the conflict that came through to the borders of Frisian communities, people donated their time, money, and materials to the cause they thought was most viable. Monasteries and wealthy families alike did what they could in supporting either the Schieringers, the Vetkopers, or even some third or fourth parties when the conflict was large enough. Once we have a solid grasp on who will bein our administration and how we will direct the legislative processes, we will be able to utilize these sources of revenue and popular support for our own purposes. We just need to be sure they don't turn things into a factional mess."
 more_than_just_trade_wars: "Multi-Sided Wars"
 more_than_just_trade_wars_desc: "As trade routes have grown throughout the 1400s, the notion of hindering enemy trade ships and merchants on the high seas has become increasingly common. In our wars against Holland, Utrecht, and other polities of the Lowlands, all of the various political parties and factions have begun to embark on these daring expeditions to disrupt enemy trade so that they can bleed the economy of the other side out. Perhaps Frisian sailors and traders can do similarly?"
 the_black_hope_of_arum: "Hope during the Blackest of Days"
 the_black_hope_of_arum_desc: "Even when the enemy has breached the walls of various Frisian towns and cities, our people do not rest easily and submit themselves to the domination of foreign invaders. Time and time again the wealthy families and individuals of our various communities have taken up arms to resist the enemy and they have even funded the arming of peasantry so that they can take part. Let this be a lesson, then, to any hostile state that would see Frisian lands annexed: there will be no rest and no peace in any community of ours that you unlawfully seize!"

 #Khoshuud Ideas
 KSD_ideas: "Khoshuud Ideas"
 KSD_ideas_start: "Khoshuud Traditions"
 KSD_ideas_bonus: "Khoshuud Ambition"
 separate_military_and_administrative_sectors: "Separated Sectors"
 separate_military_and_administrative_sectors_desc: "The Dalai Lama can handle the religious and administration of the land; we will stick to what we know best: military matters. If we can keep this healthy relationship going and our borders relatively safe, our future conquests will become much easier to integrate into our up-and-coming state."
 dissent_is_paid_for_in_blood: "To Dissent is to Die"
 dissent_is_paid_for_in_blood_desc: "We will not stand by and let those who riot and revolt take pieces of our land away from us or take valuable bits of our time up because they feel that things should be different. If they wish to dissent against our actions or the actions of the Dalai Lama, then let them break their will against our military might! There is no room for mercy for rebellious peasants or nobles in the lands of the Khoshuud!"
 to_convert_or_to_die: "One True Way of Buddhism"
 to_convert_or_to_die_desc: "Prior to us coming into the lands of Tibet to take over things, the religious landscape was full of various Tibetan Buddhist schools fighting against each other both politically and religiously to gain ultimate authority over the region. Now that we are in charge though, we can enforce the one actual true school of Tibetan Buddhism and start to root out the others from the land. They will either submit to the Dalai Lama, go into exile, or bathe in their own bloody graves."
 providing_for_ourselves_in_tibet: "Becoming Self Sustaining"
 providing_for_ourselves_in_tibet_desc: "This land isn't fertile like regions surrounding it; places like Sichuan, the Bengal Delta, and the Ganges River all host a plethora of fertile land that we would absolutely love to have, but they are not in reach just yet. Thus, we need to become more self reliant through building our own production of weapons and supplies. In conjunction with the efforts of the Dalai Lama, we can make an effective internal production chain that will keep Khoshuud ranks filled."
 zealotry_in_our_ranks: "Zealots One and All"
 zealotry_in_our_ranks_desc: "There are several states around us that refuse to follow the one true faith that holds the Dalai Lama as its head and us as its enforcers. As such, it is our duty to spread the true faith to them through either diplomacy or force, but more often than not it is going to have to be the latter. Our experience at the very start of our existence has been that of religioust strife and civil unrest due to religious differences; such experiences help stoke the fires of zealotry that burn within all Khoshuud armies."
 natural_defensiveness_of_tibet: "In Defense of the Faith"
 natural_defensiveness_of_tibet_desc: "And when our defenses like our faith are tested by ruthless invaders, we will stand tall behind the stiff mountain walls of Tibet. We need not emphasize a defensive position with several castles and fortresses like surrounding states when we have several areas where armies suffer greatly just because of nature alone; let us use these areas to our advantage when our heartland is under threat."
 break_the_balance_of_religions: "Breaking the Balance"
 break_the_balance_of_religions_desc: "For far too long there has been a sort of balance of religious schools in Tibetan lands yet the balance has shifted around from time to time, favoring one school or another depending on how things played out. With our presence throughout all of Tibet however, we are able to fully break down this balance and start to uphold one school above all others. It is through our efforts in this regard that we will gather more faithful followers and also more capable advisors with the right religious mindset."
