 tirnangael_bards:0 "Celebrated Bards"

Whether travelling from place to place, being employed by a local king, or perfecting their craft in isolation, our artists are without peer and highly sought after. Throughout the land, lineages are recorded, battles are immortalized, and history is brought to life through word and chord."
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh:0 "Gall Óglaigh"
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh_desc:0 "The Vikings had significant influence on all of Western Europe, but perhaps nowhere more so than in Gaelic lands, where they settled in great numbers and founded many of the greatest cities. Though they quickly adopted Gaelic culture, language, and religion, the proud martial tradition of these Gaelicized Norse prompted the native Gaels to begin an enduring tradition of hiring these strangers as mercenaries. Known as gall óglaigh, or foreign warriors, these units would go on to become some of the most sought after mercenaries in Europe."

 tirnangael_monastic_heritage_desc:0 "From the earliest exposure to Christianity, the Gaels have enthusiastically and competently spread their faith. From the evangelization of the Picts in Scotland and the Saxons in England, to the rise of Gaelic monasticism in central Europe, the Gaels have maintained a strong ecclesiastical tradition of benign missionaries and adaptable monasticism. While the rest of the British Isles embraced the ideals of the Reformation, the lands of the Gaels remained a bastion of Catholicism and strongly resisted the secularization of church power."
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ:0 "Beacon of Civilization"
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ_desc:0 "The Gaels were the first in Europe outside of the Greeks and Romans to adopt the written word for their language, and the only ones to maintain Latin and Greek scholarship when the rest of Europe fell into its dark ages.

In order to end the rivalry once and for all we should merge the two cities. This would increase Clermont's economic output greatly while also benefiting the clergy."

 DTT_idea_1:0 "Elusive Diplomacy"
 DTT_idea_1_desc:0 "As a small enclave of free, equal people; free from the chains of feudal lords who would gladly see us done in, we are a thorn in their side and thus we must remain forever prepared to defend our freedom. Although we're sure that our arms won't fail us, it will be impossible to stand alone in the face of ever increasing threats. We must use our ties among Hanseatic city-states and exploit the conflicts and divisions between surrounding enemies to create a more universal diplomatic policy and acquire our independence for a prolonged time."
 DTT_idea_2:0 "Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de Kumt"
 DTT_idea_2_desc:0 "Many knights, nobles, and kings have treated our militia with disrespect and disdain, only to gravely regret their mistake, facing humiliating defeat. Living and toiling in marshy terrain is what made us tough, organized, and self-reliant. However, with a new age of warfare, simply being organized won't do. We need to adapt a more stiff, regular approach, and transform our peasants' army into a true, centralized armed forces comprised of citizens willing to give their life for Dithmarscher liberty."
 DTT_idea_3:0 "Dikes of Dithmarschen"
 DTT_idea_3_desc:0 "Dikes are like veins to Dithmarschen, allowing a large part of the population to survive and also playing a crucial role in our defense system. Again, by adapting a centralized approach to dike building and carefully planning our defense lines we will be able to increase productivity of our lands as well as change our tiny homeland into an impenetrable fortress."
 DTT_idea_4:0 "Devotion to Virgin Mary"
 DTT_idea_4_desc:0 "Under the banner of Virgin Mary we have repelled innumerable invasions of powerful foes and with her image we have been sealing our laws and acts. Regardless of the faith we will choose to follow, devotion is common among Dithmarscher peasants and will serve as an additional factor uniting our society."
 DTT_idea_5:0 "Landsgemeinde"
 DTT_idea_5_desc:0 "Although Dithmarschen enjoys unified customary laws, centralized law enforcement, and an administration conducted by a council of 48 judges, land assembly is still a dominant form of lawmaking in Dithmarschen. While times may call for adopting a less democratic and time-absorbing form of government, we know that someone needs to oversee state officials' actions (especially in a society connected by strong clan ties, like ours) so that justice can be made."
 DTT_idea_6:0 "Adopt Economical Liberalism"
 DTT_idea_6_desc:0 "What scholars and learned men have proclaimed as 'liberalism' was long before practiced in Dithmarschen. Being always opposed to government oppression and tyranny and possessing still quite an attractive trading position, we should adopt laissez-faire doctrine and allow our citizens to prosper due to trade free of state interference."
 DTT_idea_7:0 "A Shining City on A Terp"
 DTT_idea_7_desc:0 "With advents of the new age, revolutionaries proclaiming liberty and equality, we will be an example to all those who would seek an implementation of their utopia into life. If we will maintain respect for ideals of self-government and democracy; the Republic of Dithmarschen will complete its transformation from autonomous peasant communes to a modern citizen-state well-suited for the future."

 LIE_idea_2:0 "Eternal Neutrality"
 LIE_idea_2_desc:0 "Seemingly endless struggles for seat of Prince-Bishop have resulted after nearly 30 years of conflict in proclamation of neutrality, which was confirmed by both relevant sides, the Empire and the Kingdom of France. We will try to avoid needless struggles and conduct our diplomacy in such a way that we can thrive in peace and not amidst constant war."
 LIE_idea_3:0 "Bonnes Villes"
 LIE_idea_3_desc:0 "Those cities that were of greatest importance in the realm were called 'Good Cities'. They had the right to build city walls and partake in administering the country by their representatives. Such a system respects rights and customs of various parts of the realm, no matter whether the language they speak is understood by the Prince-Bishop."
 LIE_idea_4:0 "Perron"
 LIE_idea_4_desc:0 "In addition to previously mentioned privileges, each Bonne Ville could erect a stone column on their town square with a globus cruciger atop of it, caller the Perron. Such a monument symbolizes autonomy and freedom, both of the Prince-Bishopric and of the Good Cities. Represented on our coat of arms, standards and badges, it reminds each of our citizens that the state they live in is an oasis surrounded by nests of tyranny and malevolence, and their undeniable rights are guaranteed by the supreme authority of the Prince-Bishop, coming from God himself."
 LIE_idea_5:0 "Liegian Renaissance"
 LIE_idea_5_desc:0 "Under the benevolent rule of prince-bishop Erard de la Marck, finances of the state were restored and the city returned to its former glory. Also, many deposits of blue limestone and marble supported architectural development in Liège, resulting in the easily recognizable style of the Mosan renaissance. Spreading style will not only result in colorful and attractive cities, but also cheaper and more solid buildings."
 LIE_idea_6:0 "Promote Weapon Industry"
 LIE_idea_6_desc:0 "The age-old mining industry of coal and iron was always vital for our state's economic well-being, but with a time of revolution in science, industry, and philosophy, development of steel factories and the weapons industry is vital. Liège may never be short of citizens willing to fight for its freedom, but it is in our competence to provide these men guns and cannons."
 LIE_idea_7:0 "Liegian Revolution"
 LIE_idea_7_desc:0 "The sudden switch from an enlightened to an authoritarian Prince-Bishop has led to unrest so large that when the French Revolution began, almost immediately a Liegian Revolution broke out. We should resurrect the legacy of the 'Athens of three Gauls', as Liège was called in the Dark Ages, wherein liberal city government and progressive reforms created a short-lived but powerful rebellion against high-class oppression, bigotry, and intolerance."

 KOL_idea_2:0 "Archchancellor of Italy"
 KOL_idea_2_desc:0 "We don't know why the title 'Archchancellor of Italy' has been passed to somebody who resides hundreds of miles beyond the Alps, but no matter how far we are from our 'domains' we keep in hand the powerful tool of Italian-style diplomacy. The prestige of carrying the highest honors in the Reich attracts cunning diplomats to our palace in Bonn."
 KOL_idea_3:0 "Kurfurst und Burgmeister"
 KOL_idea_3_desc:0 "Why in Bonn, and not in Cologne? Well, the truth is that constant conflicts between the Archbishop and burghers resulted in the secession of our nominal capital as the Free City Cologne. We should rethink our opinions on trade and divine supremacy, and turn the other cheek, if we will establish an agreement, we can get access to lucrative Rhine commerce in the richest of inland Hanseatic cities!"
 KOL_idea_4:0 "Kölner Dom"
 KOL_idea_4_desc:0 "To be in Cologne and not to see the magnificent cathedral, is to be blind... as from every street, square, and building it can be seen dominating the city skyline. Housing innumerable treasures and relics,  including precious remnants of the Three Wise Men, it guarantees we will always stay true to only the Catholic faith."
 KOL_idea_5:0 "Rote Funken"

 KOL_idea_6_desc:0 "The Wittelsbachs who couldn't count on inheriting any land from their fathers were destined to become Archbishops of Cologne. Ties with one of the grandest European dynasties make our state an important player on the continent."

 KOL_idea_7_desc:0 "You can have a feast for the eyes in Cologne, watching the monumental cathedral; feast for the ears, hearing merry tunes of carnival; feast for the taste drinking Kolsch beer; feast for the touch admiring cloth in markets; and finally a feast for the smell through the aroma of Eau de Cologne, a one-of-a-kind perfume manufactured only here. Smell like an Archbishop, Archbishop. And don't drink it, despite the fact that it smells nice and is 80% alcohol. Kolsch is better and cheaper anyways."

We have learned what it means to be prepared for diseases, lack of food and water, and we will be always prepared to survive even years of siege. God helps those who help themselves..."
 AVI_idea_2:0 "Avignon Exchange"
 AVI_idea_2_desc:0 "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy, the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to maintain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we restrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_3:0 "Republic of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_3_desc:0 "Because of our economic importance, we once declared ourselves a republic. Short was her life, feudal lords quickly subdued us to their rule. But we never forget that small communes should have a degree of autonomy, for it makes them more willing to assimilate."
 AVI_idea_4:0 "University of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_4_desc:0 "Rejoice! A wild horde of drunkards, rascals, and easygoers can come to our city and study there! Nothing good will come of this, as every coin they pay us goes toward rebuilding what they have destroyed in their drunken rage. However, ages of dealing with students gave us experience at dealing with most unpleasant diplomats politely."
 AVI_idea_5:0 "Palais des Papes"
 AVI_idea_5_desc:0 "Lets face it, Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beginning of a schism tormenting the one true Catholic church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6:0 "Bridge of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_6_desc:0 "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherhood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7:0 "Great Schism"
 AVI_idea_7_desc:0 "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spiritual ruler of half of Europe, the Pope of Avignon was supported by kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile.

 FLA_idea_2:0 "Birthplace of Capitalism"
 FLA_idea_2_desc:0 "Ancient cites of Brugge, Ghent and Antwerp, the richest in Europe, and perhaps in the whole world, give our country countless riches, primarily from cloth manufacturing.

 FLA_idea_5:0 "End the Beeldenstorm"

 FLA_idea_6:0 "Land of Humanism"
 FLA_idea_6_desc:0 "Rich merchants – despite what some may think – have more tolerance to improvements and philosophical progress than anybody else. Of course, only if these help them gain more wealth – but the more money we come across, the more refuge-seeking thinkers we see..."
 FLA_idea_7:0 "Stroppendragers"
 FLA_idea_7_desc:0 "When the citizens of Ghent rebelled against unjust taxes and the tyranny of emperor Charles VI n 1540, he stripped them of privileges, guild laws, city walls, and even clothes; and made them beg for mercy barefoot, with noose on their necks as the symbols of their guilt. Flamands, however, never lose their spirits. Even after such misfortunes we stand bravely in defense of our freedom, and Ghentiles, as well as every Flemish person, can proudly call himself a Stroppendrager – a man that despots would like to sentence to death."

However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severely declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4:0 "Old Roman Road Network"
 MAI_idea_4_desc:0 "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5:0 "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc:0 "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertile territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6:0 "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc:0 "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict. This war had ravaged the Mainzer lands and caused the end of the existence of the Imperial City of Mainz. The Bishop appointed by the Pope had won the war."
 MAI_idea_7:0 "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to become the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, sought and managed to gain more power."

The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 persons left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Würtemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."

#National Ideas Expanded

 the_two_domains: "The Two Domains"
 the_two_domains_desc: "England and France are both vast in their stretches of land and diverse in the people who fought for both. By uniting them together into one single political entity, we can combine the forces through various integrative efforts and make a unified military for the Angevin Realm itself, one that is proud, brave, and courageous enough to stand against the foes of Europe."

 inter_disciplinary_standards: "Inter-Disciplinary Standards"
 inter_disciplinary_standards_desc: "Across the Channel on both sides, the standards for military service may have been different in some senses, but they were also similar in other regards. By refining both and taking the best from both the English and the French ways of training and disciplining troops, those of the Angevin Realm can benefit from the highest quality training around."

 subjects_of_the_crowns: "Subjects of the Crowns"
 subjects_of_the_crowns_desc: "When Henry II was around to claim a majority of what is considered Angevin, there were several subject feudatories that held the realm together.

 english_channel_control: "Channel Control"
 english_channel_control_desc: "The heart of trade for us is quite obvious: the English Channel. It's a haven for trade and very profitable for us, and along with that, it has given us ample opportunity to refine our naval efforts and tactics, as well as giving us a safe gateway to the west and the east. It's our natural duty to ensure that our power propagates out from the English Channel and never fades from it."

 inter_lock_administrative_cadres: "Interlocked Administrative Cadres"
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc: "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles.

 industrialization_measures: "Industrialization Measures"
 industrialization_measures_desc: "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential.

Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."
