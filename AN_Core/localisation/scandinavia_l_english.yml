 ###MISSIONS FOR SWEDEN###
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_title:0 "Engelbrekt Rebellion"
 swe_engelbrekt_rebellion_desc:0 "In 1434 and in 1436, brave Swedish miners and peasants, led by the nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson, raised their pickaxes and pitchforks in hope of freeing Sweden from the foul influence of the Danes. But of course, the rebellion broke apart when Engelbrekt was assassinated.\nWhile his rebellion might have failed, its spirit still lives on in our people. It is time to raise troops who are ready to fight for the independence of our country!"
 swe_military_advisor_title:0 "Military Advice"
 swe_military_advisor_desc:0 "The Engelbrekt Rebellion failed due to the assassination of Engelbrekt, as well as the support of Stockholm for the Danish crown. But even if Engelbrekt would have managed to gain the support of Stockholm, he had no military skills to lead the rebels to victory. We shall do better and ensure military advice when the moment of our independence war comes."
 swe_military_advisor_tt:0 "The event '§YThe End of the Kalmar Union§!' has fired and we decided for the option '§YFreedom!§!'."
 swe_conquest_of_novgorod_title:0 "Varangians' Legacy"
 swe_conquest_of_novgorod_desc:0 "The City of Novgorod was founded by the ancient Varangians of Scandinavia when they still followed the trade paths to the Byzantine Empire in the 8th century. Eventually, Novgorod became part of the East Slavic people and the old signs of Varangians vanished. But the city still is part of our ancient heritage and as such it is our right to reclaim it."
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_title:0 "The City of the Rus"
 swe_conquest_of_moscovy_desc:1 "The city of Moscow is the home of the Muscovite people, who eventually adopted the Rus name. Like Novgord, so was Moscow founded by our ancestors, though they were mostly known as the Kievan Rus. Over the centuries, the connection between our people and Kievan Rus has become loose at best.\nHowever, the Russians of Muscovy have proven to be a formidable threat. It is in our interest to conquer their center of power to protect Sweden from their influence. The historical connection to the city is just a neat bonus."
 swe_high_income_title:0 "Increase our Income"
 swe_high_income_desc:0 "Scandinavia is not one of the richest regions of Europe. While our iron and especially our copper production keeps us above the deficit, it is still not enough revenue to secure a safe future for our [Root.GovernmentName]. We should increase our state income by any means necessary."
 swe_conquer_scania_title:0 "Swedish Skåneland"
 swe_conquer_scania_desc:0 "Skåneland is the Danish foothold in the mainland of Scandinavia. As long as Skåneland is in their hands we will always be vulnerable from the south. We should conquer this area as soon as possible in order to contain the threat of Denmark."
 swe_develop_dalaskogen_title:0 "Stora Kopparberget"
 swe_develop_dalaskogen_desc:0 "Stora Kopparberget is an old copper mine in [8.GetName], which quantity of pure copper ore has secured the economy of Sweden since as early as the 9th century. Under King Magnus IV the company which was responsible for the mining process received further privileges in 1347, which increased the production of copper even further.\nWhile Stora Kopparberget is already responsible for a sizable percentage of our income, their potential has not been fully reached yet."
 swe_industrialize_sweden_title:0 "Industrialize Sweden"
 swe_industrialize_sweden_desc:0 "Svealand is the heart of our economy. [8.GetAdjective] copper covers two thirds or Europe's demands while our iron and steel are highly sought after by the armies of this world. The demands of Europe for our metal seem to not end though. We should expand the industry of Svealand so we can cover the European markets.\nAlso, our own troops would be more than happy to fight with Swedish steel at the front too."
 swe_industrialize_sweden_tt:0 "from the provinces in §YSvealand§!, which produce §YCopper§! or §YIron§!."
 swe_swedish_allies_title:0 "Swedish Allies"
 swe_swedish_allies_desc:0 "While our people yearn for independence, our forces alone might not be enough to enforce our liberty from the Danes. We need to find allies outside Scandinavia who seek the destruction of the Kalmar Union."
 swe_swedish_allies_at:0 " rivals or enemies of §Y[DAN.GetName]§! have at least §Y100§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 swe_swedish_allies_bt:0 " rivals or enemies of our overlord have at least §Y100§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 swe_declare_independence_title:0 "Declare Independence!"
 swe_declare_independence_desc:0 "The time for our independence has finally come! Let us break this union of incompetence and establish a crown which is worthy to rule over Sweden!"
 swe_declare_independence_ct:0 "We will get an event, which grants us permanent claims on all provinces required for the missions '§YThe German Coastline§!', '§YWindow to the east§!' and '§YVarangians' Legacy§!' if we win the §YIndependence War§!."
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_title:0 "The Crown of Norway"
 swe_claim_norwegian_crown_desc:0 "The Kalmar Union has been crippled by our independence, but it still remains due to the close ties between Denmark and Norway. Although the Danish king wants to deny it, Norway is mostly a province in the eyes of the Danish administration rather than a real kingdom of its own. It is our duty as good neighbor to free the Norwegians from Danish oppression and let them be ruled by a caring monarch for once."
 swe_fall_of_denmark_title:0 "Fall of Denmark"
 swe_fall_of_denmark_desc:0 "With Norway under our care, Denmark is all that is left of the once mighty Kalmar "Union". Still, our independence will always be threatened as long a Danish king exists. It is time to take Denmark for ourselves and do what the Kalmar Union never did: unite all of Scandinavia under one proper king."
 swe_colonial_ambitions_title:0 "Colonial Ambitions"
 swe_colonial_ambitions_desc:0 "The world is at the edge of a new era. Our neighbors are discovering landmasses beyond the Atlantic Ocean, or finding trade routes to India around Africa. They are gathering wealth and power while we are stuck in the North. We cannot allow us to slack behind all the other great powers. It is time that we set colonial ambitions of our own!"
 swe_colonial_ambitions_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on every §YCenter of Trade§! or province with an §YEstuary§! in §YColonial Eastern America§! and §YColonial Canada§!."
 swe_colonize_delaware_title:0 "New Sweden"
 swe_colonize_delaware_desc:0 "The New World is full of opportunities and wealth which our [Root.GovernmentName] can certainly use. It is of great priority that we establish settlements in the New World."
 swe_colonize_delaware_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on every §YCenter of Trade§! or province with an §YEstuary§! in §YColonial Caribbean§!."
 swe_colonize_caribbeans_title:0 "Colonize the Caribbean"
 swe_colonize_caribbeans_desc:0 "The Caribbean is the virtual center of trade of the New World. All paths eventually lead to the Caribbean and from there the trade flows into Europe. Whoever holds the Caribbean also holds the trade flow of two entire continents. Naturally, we must ensure that we are the ones who steer the New World's trade by colonizing these islands for ourselves."

But for the most part though our realms coexisted without much interaction. However, with the looming threat of the Polish Kingdom it is time to reach out to the Emperor and seek Imperial protection. The question is what demands might they make in agreeing to protect us..."

These were all lost when Andrew's heir, Béla, and the Hungarian nobility expelled us from our rightful lands.\n\nAfter over 200 years, the Burzenland is once again under Teutonic control. During our absence, the once wooden fortification of Dietrichstein has been torn down. In its place is now the Bran Castle instead, which architecture caught the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors.

In return, we had to provide protection for the merchants of the Hansa, though this eventually turned into an error for our state as said merchants formed later the threatening Prussian Confederation.\n\nStill, the Hansa is a valuable asset to our treasury.

However, their recent history of wars against Poland and an already Christianized Lithuania gave these knights a rather bad reputation. No longer are they fighting for the Holy See but for personal gains, and the counties bordering the Order fear aggression from the Order's side.\nWhile more members in the Empire is always a welcome sight, accepting the Order into the Empire - even if it is only temporarily - might make [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] of [Emperor.GetName] rather unpopular with the duchies which border this order."

 ###LIVONIAN EVENTS###
 flavor_liv.0.t:0 "The Situation of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.0.desc:1 "The Livonian Order is the successor of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, an order of knights which was annihilated by the Samogitians in 1236. While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\nHowever, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Kalmar Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.0.a.tt:1 "The §YLivonian Order§! has a unique mission tree, which is more flexible than other mission trees. After finishing the mission '§YStrengthen Our Authority§!' we will receive an event, which allows us to replace the Branching Missions with missions from one of the two following paths:\n\n§YLivonian Path§!\nThe Livonian Path is one about secularizing and dissolving the Livonian Order, and reforming into the nation of §YLivonia§!. It will revolve around the development of the §YBaltic§! region and the colonization of the §YNew World§!. It will also allow us to form our own §YGovernment§!, which is forged by our needs and actions.\n\n§YCrusader Path§!\nThe Crusader Path is one about sticking to the purpose of the Order, which is the Chrstianizing of Heathens and Heretics. Your mission tree will lead you on a campaign of conquest and coversion of §YRussia§! and establishing a Catholic Empire in §YEastern Europe§!."
 flavor_liv.1.t:0 "The Future of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.1.desc:0 "Our Order managed to get the Livonian Confederacy at bay, and secured a future. However, it is apparent that our Order is lacking a proper direction. The dawn of a new era is approaching, and it is now more than ever time to choose how the direction of our state shall look like."
 flavor_liv.1.a:0 "The time of the crusades is over. We shall become a secularized realm!"
 flavor_liv.1.a.tt:0 "Unlock the §YLivonian§! mission path."

 flavor_liv.2.t:0 "Dissolution of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.2.desc:0 "Our army is ready to enforce the dissolution of one of the members of the Livonian Confederacy. The question is: which Bishopric should be our target?"
 flavor_liv.2.a:0 "The Bishopric of Dorpat has been a thorn in our side for far too long."
 flavor_liv.2.b:0 "We must crush the Bishopric of Ösel."
 flavor_liv.2.c:0 "It is time to end the Bishopric of Courland."
 flavor_liv.2.d:0 "The Bishop of Reval shall submit."
 flavor_liv.2.e:0 "We cannot dissolve any of these Bishoprics..."
 flavor_liv.2.f:0 "What Bishoprics?"
 flavor_liv.3.t:0 "Purchase of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.3.desc:0 "The Livonian Confederacy is making it difficult to maintain our rule over the lands of Curonia, Livonia and Estonia. Fortunately, these bishops are not the saints they claim to be, and are willing to sell their land to us."
 flavor_liv.3.a:0 "The Bishopric of Dorpat has been a thorn in our side for far too long."

 flavor_liv.3.d:0 "The Bishop of Reval shall enjoy his money."
 flavor_liv.4.t:0 "Secularization of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.4.desc:0 "We are an Order of knights, which had only one goal: the Christianization of the Baltic lands - and we achieved this goal. However, with the Reformation spreading it has become more and more apparent to us that our order has lost its point, and a crusade against fellow Christians is more than absurd according to our advisors.\nMaybe it is finally time to dissolve the Livonian Order as we know it, and form a proper kingdom - the Kingdom of Livonia."
 flavor_liv.4.a:0 "From this day forth the world shall know us as Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.4.b:0 "We cannot dissolve our Order just yet."
 flavor_liv.5.t:0 "Prussian-Livonian Alliance"
 flavor_liv.5.desc:0 "Prussia is the successor of the Teutonic Order, our old ally and former overlord. Naturally, our connection with the Prussians runs deep as we have a common history of fighting back to back against the Baltic pagans and the Polish armies.\nOur most recent war has shown that while we have grown into separate states, our friendship still prevails to this day."
 flavor_liv.5.a:0 "Our both countries shall stand united against any threat!"
 flavor_liv.6.t:0 "The Creation of a new Government"
 flavor_liv.6.desc:0 "Our secularization made our country into a monarchy like many others around us. However, as our state is relatively young in comparison, we lack the experiences and traditions our neighbors have made during their lifetime. Even our allies in the Prussian lands have started to introduce systems of efficient administration to their monarchy.\nIt is time that we learn from the experiences of our neighbors, and shape a monarchy which suits our needs."
 flavor_liv.6.a:0 "Les us found a Monarchy worthy to be part of Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.7.t:0 "Livonia declares the end of the Schism"
 flavor_liv.7.desc:0 "Having the Russian lands fallen into Catholic hands, the knights of Livonia have declared that the Great Schism has ended and that all the Christendom shall follow the leadership of the Papacy. This is however not something that the Pope himself has endorsed, so the validity of the declaration is still under doubt, but these conquests may be an indication that God himself favors Catholicism."
 flavor_liv.7.a:0 "God's intention is clear, the Pope shall lead."
 flavor_liv.7.b:0 "Some mere knights cannot dismiss the Patriarchs."
 flavor_liv.8.t:0 "Decline of the Lübeck Trade Dominance"
 flavor_liv.8.desc:0 "We gained access to the Lübeck trade through various means and ways, which allowed us to grow in wealth and power. So much so that we finally managed to expand westwards, and acquired a center of trade near Lübeck itself.\nDue to our progress, the Hansa felt threatened and started limiting our access to their market now."
 flavor_liv.8.a:0 "Quite unfortunate."
 flavor_liv.13.t:0 "Question of Teutonic-Livonian Relations"
 flavor_liv.13.desc:0 "The Teutonic Order have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. If we tighten our mutual bonds, the benefits for the Faith could be unmeasurable."
 flavor_liv.13.a:0 "Let us strengthen the bond between us, and see each other eye to eye."

 flavor_liv.13.b:0 "Our alliance with the Teutonic Order is just a means for the end."
 flavor_liv.14.t:0 "Bound between Livonia and the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_liv.14.desc:0 "The knights of Livonia have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. The Livonian knights have come to us to that effect and established a headquarter in our capital. We should return the favor."
 flavor_liv.14.a:0 "This might be a fruitful connection"
 flavor_liv.15.t:0 "Militarization of the Knights"
 flavor_liv.15.desc:0 "Our Order started already as a military order, but we have managed to improve the organization and administration behind its knights. As such, our troops are already a proper army instead of just a group of crusader knights."
 flavor_liv.15.a:0 "Our Knights will triumph."
 flavor_liv.16.t:0 "An Army with a Monastery"
 flavor_liv.16.desc:0 "Our recent military reforms have improved our capabilities quite a lot, but there is still room for improvement. By completely embracing the militarization of our Order we could have an army comparable to any other major country. We would turn from some monasteries with an army to an army with monasteries."
 flavor_liv.16.a:0 "Let's embrace it."
 flavor_liv.16.b:0 "Let's not go overboard."
 flavor_liv.17.t:0 "Second Battle on the Ice"
 flavor_liv.17.desc:0 "Our defeat at the hands of Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod and their allies from Vladimir in 1242 had been a stain in our military history. Now the tables have turn and we have managed to make them taste defeat instead."
 flavor_liv.17.a:1 "May this serve as a warning to all of our enemies."
 flavor_liv.18.t:0 "A Crusading Kingdom"
 flavor_liv.18.desc:0 "Our crusading state have greatly surpased its initial objectives and we have expanded to great lengths. We have gone beyond a mere crusading state and have become a true Crusading Kingdom."

 #Events
 flavor_pol.23.t:0 "The Little Kings Uprising"
 flavor_pol.23.d:0 "The recent developments in the shift of powers within our realm have not gone unnoticed. For centuries, the Polish nobility has relentlessly pushed for more autonomy and privileges. However, the recent attempts to consolidate power by our monarch have seemingly caused an open rebellion, spearheaded by the most powerful families within our domain."
 flavor_pol.23.a:0 "There can only be one!"
 
 flavor_pol.24.t:0 "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
 flavor_pol.24.d:0 "The administration of the Polish crown has been in dire straits for as long as anyone can remember. With the landed nobles' power at peak, passing jurisprudence and signing reforms has been a nightmarish endeavor. With what can be described as unique diplomatic and administrative prowess, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to accumulate enough political capital, as well as favors, to rid our court of these pesky feudal leeches."
 flavor_pol.24.a:0 "The nation is in dire need of reforms!"
 flavor_pol.24.b:0 "Some reforms are in order."
 flavor_pol.24.c:0 "All shall be equal under the Polish banner!"
 
 flavor_pol.25.t:0 "The Polish-Bohemian Pact of Cooperation"
 flavor_pol.25.d:0 "It is said that close cooperation and diplomacy can make or break the fate of nations. Recent attempts to reconcile our differences with our Polish brethren in the East have led to the culmination of the Polish-Bohemian pact of Cooperation of the year [GetYear]. It is up to us how and in which manner to proceed and react to such a profound extension of friendship and cohabitation."
 flavor_pol.25.a:0 "The crown of Poland will lead the way for a union of our states."
 flavor_pol.25.b:0 "Together our two domains will prosper, as equals."

 flavor_pol.26.c:0 "I wouldn't wipe my boots with the Polish banner!"
 
 flavor_pol.27.t:0 "Expanding the Quarter Army"
 flavor_pol.27.d:1 "The foundations of a regular army were established in Poland in the transition from the 15th to the 16th centuries, to protect its south-eastern borderlands from the Tatar raids. This system was expanded in 1563, when Sigismund II Augustus broke a deal with the Sejm to fund it with a quarter of all the revenues collected at the royal lands, from where it took its name, the Quarter Army. Now, to safeguard our people, protect our interests, and maintain our growth and prosperity, we must move along with the times and embrace any and all useful technological advancements, especially in the military field and the conduct of warfare. Our choice in this matter will surely echo in the chambers of history."
 flavor_pol.27.a:0 "A general reform would fit our army nicely!"
 flavor_pol.27.b:0 "Reform the Hussar cavalry!"
 flavor_pol.27.c:0 "Improve our firing techniques."

 flavor_pol.28.d:0 "Wealth and inheritance are powerful tools when employed for the benefit of the public. Such is the story of the first Academy in Krakow, Collegium Maius. The essence of a thinking nation, captivated within the beautiful walls of a Renaissance-styled building shall pave the way for our glorious minds and their path to the stars, offering knowledge and growth to great men such as Nikolaus Copernicus."
 flavor_pol.28.a:0 "A glorious establishment to cultivate the future generations!"
 
 flavor_pol.29.t:0 "Securing the Moldavian Domain"
 flavor_pol.29.d:0 "The situation in Moldavia has turned quite dire. Our ducal neighbor to the South has fallen from the public's grace as of late. Indeed, the country was recently embroiled in a vicious and bloody civil war. But, out of chaos comes order and we must be better than our Moldavian predecessors when it comes to ruiling the land. Thus, preparations and decisions are in order to safeguard our interests and grip on the region."

 flavor_pol.29.b:0 "We can't risk meddling in local feuds..."
 flavor_pol.29.c:0 "They answer to ME!"
 
 flavor_pol.30.t:0 "The Crown of Rome"
 flavor_pol.30.d:0 "The glorious city of [151.GetName] is in our hands! Once the great capital of Byzantium, the Turkish armies of the Ottoman Sultanate conquered the city and removed the Byzantine Empire from the face of the Earth.\nBut today, the city is free from the clutches of the Ottomans! While the majority of [Root.GetName] is celebrating our conquest of the city, the [Root.GetAdjective] court is concerned about the government of [151.GetName]. While it would be prestigeous to keep the city for ourselves, the advisors of [Root.Monarch.GetName] suggest to re-establish the state of Byzantium or the great Latin Empire."
 flavor_pol.30.a:1 "Restore the §YPhoenix§! to its former glory."
 flavor_pol.30.b:0 "The §YLatin Empire§! shall live once more!"
 flavor_pol.30.c:0 "[151.GetName] belongs to us!"
 
 flavor_pol.31.t:0 "Baltic Gold & the Gates of Kings"
 flavor_pol.31.d:0 "Vanquishing our enemies and rummaging through their domain, taking what is rightfully ours is only half the joy. What good is wealth without a home to return to? A home adorned with golden arches, the architecture conceptualized by scores of Renaissance men, eager to leave their mark on one of the world's most influential and important cities. [43.GetName] bears all the marks necessary to be the home of our ever-growing nation."
 flavor_pol.31.a:0 "A city befitting royalty!"
 
 flavor_pol.32.t:0 "Negotiations of Lublin"
 flavor_pol.32.d:0 "It is no secret that power and influence have an adverse effect on people. However, power wielded carefully and guided by a steady hand can yield tremendously positive results for our foreign and domestic affairs. The infantile nobles of Lithuania have been pestering us with their refusal to participate in the Sejm Diets and congregations, grinding the entire process to a halt. If they do not comprehend the diplomatic tongue, perhaps they would be more atuned to a show of strength at the expense of their own lands?"
 flavor_pol.32.a:0 "Force the Lithuanians to sign the agreement."
 flavor_pol.32.b:0 "We cannot risk our delicate relations..."
 
 flavor_pol.33.t:0 "The Sejm Diet of [GetYear]"
 flavor_pol.33.d:0 "One quiet morning in [GetYear], the messenger bursts through the doors of the Imperial palace, red and flustered, eager to deliver a valuable correspondence from the seat of power in Poland. Apparently, the local noble of Poland who was recently crowned a King decided, against the calls of his own advisors, to steer his nation away from its ties to Lithuania, turning its gaze upon the West. As a result, the monarch of Poland has officially petitioned for the entry of his country in the Holy Roman Empire."
 flavor_pol.33.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!"
 flavor_pol.33.b:0 "As long as we are the heads of the Empire, they shall never join it!"

 flavor_lit.14.t:0 "Canonization of Kazimierz Jagiellon"
 flavor_lit.14.d:0 "Originally born in the royal palace at Warsaw, Casimir was brought into adulthood under the tutelage of a Polish priest. His conservative upbringing led him to value his faith and wear it as an emblem upon his chest. His works during his reign, namely the erection of several temples and the betterment of relations with the Holy See led to him being declared a saint, a vibrant figure of Lithuanian piety and religious strength."
 flavor_lit.14.a:0 "Bless our lord!"
 
 
 flavor_lit.15.t:0 "Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu"
 flavor_lit.15.d:0 "In [GetYear], after a request of the monarch and the upper echelons of the nobility, the Jesuit Academy was created in [272.GetName]. Its primary function was to intermarry religion and science, philosophy and the humanities with theology. The first students enrolled soon after and a grand library was established in the same year, with various prominent figures of Lithuanian politics donating thousands of books and tomes of knowledge."
 flavor_lit.15.a:0 "What a time to be alive!"
 
 flavor_lit.16.t:0 "Restoration of Old Ties"
 flavor_lit.16.d:0 "The throne of Poland has remained vacant for quite some time, after the tragic passing of the last Polish monarch in the fields of Varna. Having suffered a crushing defeat against the Ottoman forces, the Polish crown shattered, ending a union between three of Europe's largest nations. Now, Polish messengers bring word, asking for our very own Kazimierz to relocate to the Polish capital in order to govern both our nations from his newfound seat of power. However, this would mean giving up on our independence, and to a large extend our autonomy. Our choice in this matter is sure to ripple across the chambers of history."
 flavor_lit.16.a:0 "Our fates are aligned, so be it."
 flavor_lit.16.b:0 "We cannot risk our independence..."
 
 flavor_lit.17.t:0 "The Crimean Steppes"
 flavor_lit.17.d:0 "Our conquests across the Crimean steppes have yielded great returns, with our domain expanding and newly acquired taxable land. However, this land is foreign to us, its customs and nomadic people remain a mystery. Our advisors at court have come forward with a great many choices as to how to approach this situation. Some suggest we delegate the lands' administration to our Cossack nobles, suggesting their favor and loyalty in exchange for this domain. However, other voices in our council support the idea of a direct governorship or even the inclusion of the nomadic horselords into our administration until their eventual and total assimilation."
 flavor_lit.17.a:0 "Entrust the steppes to the Cossacks."

He tended to his studies as a student in the university of Krakow from whence he graduated with a degree in arts and later received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Padua in Italy. Years later, after his academic career was complete, he would go on to found several printing houses spanning between Prague and Vilnius. Some of his printing work includes the Psalter and a multilingual translation of the Bible."
 flavor_lit.18.a:0 "And thus we shall become acquainted with the spread of wisdom and science."
 
 flavor_lit.19.t:0 "Khmelnytsky Uprising"
 flavor_lit.19.d:0 "The most deprived elements in our court, the Cossacks that make up the backbone of our mobile arms, have sent for an ultimatum to the highest authority of the lands. Recent developments in court affairs have left their Hetmans very displeased and they now dare to demand their independence. Their aspirations for independence feed into their unrealistic dream that led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ruthenia. If their demands are not met, they threaten the commitment of atrocities and looting all across our countryside."
 flavor_lit.19.a:0 "Give them the autonomy they yearn for."

 flavor_hsa.6.d:0 "The basis for the market's popularity was the rich herring fishing around the Falsterbo Peninsula. Legend tells that the herring fishery off the Scanian coast was so rich, that one could scoop up the fish with one's hands. After a visit to the region in 1364, the French crusader Philippe de Mézières wrote: "Two months a year, that is in September and October, the herring travel from one sea to the other through the Sound, by order of God, in such large numbers that it is a great wonder, and so many pass through the sound in these months, that at several places one can cut them with a dagger." \n\nEmbarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable. However, despite the abundance of marine life in the pass, many advisors in our court suggest we best stay loyal to our main export, Lubeckian naval supplies."

Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Since then, the League lost its touch and the offices were granted to other local and foreign merchants. \n\nAround [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe."

 flavor_hsa.8.t:0 "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d:0 "Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and invasion by the Danish army under King Valdemar Atterdag in 1361. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."

 flavor_hsa.9.d:0 "The Prussian Confederation (German: Preussischer Bund, Polish: Zwiazek Pruski) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights. It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles. \n\nIn 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bazynski), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter. \n\nDespite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lubeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."

Our League houses merchants from all over Europe and they meet annually to make decisions as 43 of the 67 Hanseatic Days (Hansetage) took place in Lübeck, which was positioned geographically favorable. This resulted in us taking the leading role in the Hanseatic League. The hub of power was the Town Hall erected in [GetYear] which serves as the central assembly and deliberation chamber for matters of the League. It is one of the most famous Gothic brickwork structures. With its impressive facade, it resembles a fairytale castle. The shape of the building has been defined over three centuries: from 1226 to even today, a succession of new elements were added, and there were conversions and extensions such as the sandstone arcade, the raising of the striking facade with its distinctive circular holes for improved wind resistance as well as the bay window and impressive grand staircase."

It is in fact a series of fortifications added over time to further protect the inhabitants and their riches inside. In particular, the Holstentor is split into 3 layers: the Inner, Middle and Outer Gates. Each was built as a response to the advances of gunpowder and siege equipment, the latest addition of fortifications will surely be adequate and proven to be a sound investment for the safeguard of our wealth. \n\nThe Burgtor is the oldest of the four former gates of the medieval city fortifications of Lübeck. At the end of the Große Burgstraße, located at the northern end of the historic old town of Lübeck, you will find the castle gate, which was built in the late Gothic style. In addition to the more famous Holsten Gate, the Burgtor is the second largest city gate of the Lübeck city fortifications. The Lübeck Castle Gate takes its name from the old Lübeck Castle high above the Trave, which was converted into a castle monastery in 1227."

 flavor_hsa.12.d:0 "Mercantilism is an economic theory that advocates government regulation of international trade to generate wealth and strengthen national power. Merchants and the government work together to reduce the trade deficit and create a surplus. Mercantilism, a form of economic nationalism, funds corporate, military, and national growth. It advocates trade policies that protect domestic industries. In mercantilism, the government strengthens the private owners of the factors of production. \n\nThese four factors of production are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources and labor. Mercantilism establishes monopolies, grants tax free status, and grants pensions to favoured industries. It imposes tariffs on imports. It also prohibits the emigration of skilled labor, capital, and tools. It doesn't allow anything that could help foreign companies. In return, businesses funnel the riches from foreign expansion back to their governments. Its taxes pay for increase national growth and political power."

 flavor_hsa.13.t:0 "The Hanseatic Cog"
 flavor_hsa.13.d:1 "The Hansa used a ship called the cog for sea transport. It was a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. A helm at the stern and a flat floor made it possible to ship in low water. Unlike the Nordic longboats they were more economical to use. A cog could transport a relatively large amount of cargo with just a small crew, up to 90 tons. It was produced relatively quickly and inexpensively at that time. \n\nLarger loads could be transported more cheaply and by a smaller crew than previously. That's what made this type of ship so successful. There were cogs of different sizes, between 15 and 25 m in length, 5-8 m wide and with a moulded depth of 3-5 m. The measurement of the capacity of a cog was called “last”, equivalent to 2 tons. This was the capacity of a carriage drawn by four horses. A small cog of 50 last was able to carry the same load as an endless convoy of 50 waggons pulled by 200 horses. There were also cogs twice as big. With the castle (aft) the surroundings could be observed well. Due to the lack of keel, the cog could also fall to ground during low tide, but it was also restricted to navigate because of that. A cog could only ride with the wind and not cross the wind."

Adler von Lübeck was one of the largest ships in the world at her time, being 78.30 m long overall and displacing 2-3,000 tons. The war galleon was built by Lübeck during the Northern Seven Years' War to escort her convoy of merchant ships in the Baltic and North Sea. \n\nSuch naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals.

The court of their feeble monarch is torn asunder as petty nobles fight over the royal authority, as well as the right to exercise it. Recently, we have been approached by foreign agents purporting to be messengers of the rebelling factions in the court of Denmark. They suggest that a monetary donation of a certain magnitude would assist them in their endeavours against their tyrannical overlord. Whatever the case may be, this could be our chance to mingle in Danish politics and weaken their crown authority!"

 flavor_hsa.23.b:0 "We will stand firmly with the royal family of Denmark."

 flavor_hsa.24.d:0 "Many factors certainly have contributed to the downfall of the Hanseatic League during the first half of the 15th century. Be it disease, misfortune, divine retribution or the Bullion Famine, our court lost its old splendor and its standing as a powerful mercantile union of hundreds of merchants across the germanic cities and beyond. In its stead, the scheming merchants of the Dutch court attempt to usurp our position and surpass us in terms of influence across the markets of Europe. Such behavior is no less the grounds for just wars and these petty men of Holland must be put in their place lest we risk inevitable demise."
 flavor_hsa.24.a:0 "We will have their heads for this!"
 
 flavor_hsa.25.t:0 "Hans Holbein the Younger"
 flavor_hsa.25.d:0 "Hans Holbein (the Younger) was a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school. \n\nHolbein was born in Augsburg, but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, designed stained glass windows, and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own. \n\nHolbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII of England. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England. \nHolbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him "the Apelles of our time," a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great "one-off" of art history, since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected, and he was recognised among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes. \n\nHolbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture "remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style"."

 flavor_hsa.26.t:0 "The Crowning of a New Queen"
 flavor_hsa.26.d:0 "Many proclaimed our Republic to be on its dying breath as the second half of the 15th century saw our merchants struggling to maintain (and often losing) their monopoly across the many trade centers of Europe. Despite several setbacks and the machinations of our enemies, we have managed to not only come out on top but to also reinforce the values of our Trade League. Dominating in the most important markets from Norway to the Baltic we have proved our naysayers wrong, elevating the status of our great nation to never-before-seen heights! Truly this is the crowing of Germany's most powerful Queen! Long live the Hansa!"
