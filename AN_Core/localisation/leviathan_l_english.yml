 potlatch:0 "Potlatch"
 potlatch_desc:1 "A potlatch is the most important event in the social life of our communities. A potlatch is a highly complex event where we commemorate a specific event by gathering together; in them, usually the chief of the tribe would prove his own wealth by lavishly giving highly elaborate and expensive gifts to visiting people. In these ceremonies, great feasts and displays of conspicuous consumption happen and being invited to them is considered a high honor."

We feed our people with its flesh, we use its bones for tools, we use its fur against the cold during the long winters or its hides for our clothes or to cover our tipis, we use its soul as our symbol animal. Such is the importance of the bison for our culture that we would feel guideless without them."
 bow_archery:0 "Bow Archery"
 bow_archery_desc:0 "Among our many tools, the bow is one of the most important. We need the bows to hunt and through it to feed our people or to war our foes when the time comes.

 dwellers_of_tipis:0 "Dwellers of Tipis"
 dwellers_of_tipis_desc:1 "Tipis are our traditional animal hide made, usually bison, tents supported by solid wooden poles that we use as our homes. They have a smoke flap on the top, that allows us to make fires in the inside to fight the cold in winter. These tents are durable, provide warmth and comfort in winter, are cool in the heat of the summer and dry during heavy rains. But best of all, they can be disassembled and packed away quickly, so they are perfect for when we need to relocate."

The number of mares and stallions are big among the tribes, and they have become one with us. A part of our culture forever."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men and tell them [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wish to go on hunting. One of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most expert men approaches and asks [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] which prey [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wants to hunt."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] does not hesitate and follow the man through the woods until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. A big deer, the biggest [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen poses majestic in the middle of a clearing. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispers a short 'thank you' to the spirits of the forest for this opportunity that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not miss. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] orders [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to stay quiet and in their positions as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] starts to silently move towards the best position to fire [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bow. The bow is ready to release the arrow destined to kill the animal. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s breath is calm. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] fingers start to free the arrow."
 native_americans.29.d2:1 "A woman from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]'s tribe approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is fishing as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tribe usually does to feed their people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head towards her, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes meet and [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows she has seen something unusual, but good, nevertheless. With piety in her gaze, she whispers how she has seen the biggest salmon ever, a true incarnation of the spirit of the river we so deeply worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] follows her to the spot where she saw it and after a few breaths [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally sees it. It is huge indeed. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tools to capture it."
 native_americans.29.d3:2 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] was going back home with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe after a good day of seal hunting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw not far away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position a huge seal, a true blessing from the gods, emerge from the depths of the sea. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] harpoon and quietly moves closer to it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the row over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe, stand up and have the harpoon ready to be fired. The seal emerges, their gazes contact as [Root.Monarch.GetName] releases the weapon."
 native_americans.29.d4:2 "The hunting group is coming back home when among the group of pronghorns that comes across [Root.Monarch.GetName], the biggest antelope [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen appears. Almost as if it was a deity, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can feel a special bright aura around it and immediately knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to hunt it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the group behind and move silently to sneak the animal. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, hoping to not miss the chance."
 native_americans.29.d5:1 "The land trembles as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets closer to the herd of bison. These animals can kill anyone with their gore attacks with ease, but they are also life for our people. Suddenly, among them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see a massive male that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows has to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for this unequal fight before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors with a quick pray.

Although it is not as deadly as a spear or arrow, the boomerang is a reliable and reusable hunting tool and a deadly weapon in the hands of a skilled warrior. The reduced fatality rate of a boomerang makes it the ideal tool for battles where the aim is to take prisoners, not inflict casualties."

It is the female dynasties which determine the fate of our children; their group, life, spirit, breath, and pulse. The female brings life and form to the child, and the male locates a spirit to bring for the unborn child.

Purrukapali, distressed by what had happened, picked up the dried corpse of his boy and carried him to the wise Japara who promised to restore the boy to life in time, but Purrukapali in a fit of distress and impatience engaged Japara in a great battle. Purrukapali picked up the dead body of his son and carried him into the sea, proclaiming that death should come to all creation so that all would experience the grief he feels. The site where he carried his son became a strong whirlpool that would drown anyone who came near it. Japara, who ended Purrukapali’s madness, was reincarnated into the moon and became trapped in a cycle of death and reincarnation every three days."

Marriage is as important to our livelihood as fishing, farming, and foraging, and a Tiwi woman who is unmarried is simply idle and belligerent. Remarriage is common for our people, and often lower members of society such as low-ranking hunters would often marry the widows of more successful men. Remarriage must happen quickly, for each day a woman remains unmarried is a day of great shame."

Notable landmarks and features across the continent are often described as being the resting places for the gods, or relics of ancient conflicts that took place during the Dreamtime. The Rainbow Serpent, which is often seen as a creator god, is claimed to be the bringer of rain, and when a rainbow appears in the sky, it is the rainbow serpent moving from one watering hole to another."
 aborig_dreamtime:0 "Dreamtime"
 aborig_dreamtime_desc:0 "The Dreamtime refers to the time before the creation of the universe; when all that existed were spirits and gods. Different tribes have differing explanations for what brought the world into existence from the Dreamtime, but almost all tribes in Australia believed in this time before material existence. To practice meditation or worship of gods and ancestors is often described as “Dreaming”, and tapping into the knowledge of the Dreamtime scape. This is because in the Dreamtime, one’s entire ancestry exists as one, and the knowledge of your ancestors is readily available in the Dreamtime if one is able to access it."

In many wars and conflicts which have come to the shores of Australia, Eora men and women would eagerly volunteer to fight and defend their land; even during times when they were seen as second-class citizens. It’s our willingness to fight and defend the sacred land which rallies new generations constantly to our cause."

While other tribes would abandon their homes in a heartbeat for more fertile lands, we Eora have always been here and always will be here.

Even whales and fur seals would occasionally wander to Palawan shores and bring with them the great bounty of their meats, bone, and fur.

Moinee was the architect of the world; forming land and rivers of our island, and finally taking the wandering spirit of Parlevar and granting him the body of the first man. What followed shortly after was the Kangaroo, which Moinee made in Parlevar’s image, who then emerged from the soil in the ground. Droemerdene took the form of a star and acted as humanity’s guide and transformed these kangaroo-men into human beings; removing their tales and fashioning knees so they may rest. The original human beings were Palawa, and hence any who resist the Palawa identity are merely denying their ancestors."

Our earliest works included information about the island itself, our history, and great works of poetry written in Palawa languages. Our quick mastery of the written word is a clear demonstration that we Palawa are expert at embracing new ideas and shifting our old traditions to flow with the changing times."

A Kaumatua is elected by their family for their supreme intellect, wisdom, and renown to ensure that the family and Iwi as a whole continues to maintain the sacred traditions valued to the Maori. Kaumatua holds the soul of an immortal demi-god who possesses the power of reincarnation, and have existed across countless lifetimes, and may return at any moment to give the family guidance."
 kapa_haka:0 "Kapa Haka"
 kapa_haka_desc:1 "The Kapa Haka is a series of stomps and chants, most comparable to a war-dance.

The dance demonstrates strength and prowess, while belittling the strength and prowess of their enemy."

 pa_defence_desc:0 "A Pa is a Maori village built in a highly defensible position. Similar to European castles, a Pa is constructed to ensure the continued survival of the local people during wartime. Pa are strong and defensive, but inexpensive and can be built and maintained for little more than a standard village, so while our enemies wait and starve outside our gates, we may continue to prosper within the walls of our mighty fortified village."

We mark these tattoos into our skin with chisels, as we are as tough and unmoving as stone, and we welcome the scars they leave behind. To be marked with traditional tattoos is a sign of great strength and prestige, and causes the weak foreigners to tremble as we charge towards them; our faces blessed by the markings of our gods and ancestors."

 maori_king_desc:1 "In 1858, by popular demand, a Maori king was elected to represent, but not rule over, all other Iwi. Though some rejected the authority of this democratically selected King, many Maori flocked to the King's cause as a way of preventing the alienation of Maori land by the British colonists. Just as Victoria ruled over all the Brits, this king would rule over all the Maori and allow equal negotiations with the Europeans with a unified voice."

 fijian_conjoined_desc:0 "It has been said that Fijian society and religion are conjoined, and that any attempt to separate the two would result in irreparable damage to them both. While the separation of church and state may sound progressive in theory, in reality the very laws which govern our daily lives come from the wisdom of the great prophets and the Gods. While we accept cultures different from our own, if these people are to live here, they must come to understand our Gods and spirits if they are to call themselves Fijian."

The Waqa Drua is the largest and finest seafaring vessel in all the known world, and other kingdoms tremble as they witness our vast ship's approach. Our mastery of ship craft and naval warfare has kept Fiji safe from foreign invaders, and so long as our mighty oceangoing armies maintain our long naval tradition, Fiji shall maintain its sovereignty."

 fijian_warlords_desc:0 "The mountainous nature of our islands have made it difficult to consolidate the different clans together and due to this fragmentation, fights over the territory are a constant thing.

Kai Colo are the mountainous people of Fiji and produce the finest and hardiest warriors our islands have to offer. We do not suffer in the face of adverse climates, and we are adaptable to all terrain. During the war, the Kai Colo held out in their mountainous homes against a foe far more advanced than them. This was a battle that determined the continued existence of the Kai Colo, and unsurprisingly, our superior warriors won out in the end."

With the unification of Hawaii, we cannot simply depose the old rulers of these regions, but rather we can redefine the meaning of Ali'i Nui into a secular position appointed by the King of Hawaii, solidifying our position without upsetting the Ali'i."

It is the medium by which we preserve our history, our culture, and tell stories of our ancestors and gods. The Oli or Mele describes the events as they happened with words, and the Hula translates those words into physical movement. The movement of our bodies and hands represent the literal words spoken or sung by the Oli and Mele, but also may represent the events of the story such as the flowing of the waves or the intense emotions of the legendary heroes of old."
 ohana:0 "Ohana"
 ohana_desc:0 "Ohana is the Hawaiian concept of family, and has long extended beyond mere blood relation. A family takes many forms, and adopted family is of equal importance to blood family. It was common practice for a great ruler to adopt trusted friends and allies into his or her family and treat them as kin, and our malleable concept of family makes Hawaiian society one which may welcome foreigners and strangers with brotherly arms."

There are many stories of the exploits of the great Tangaloa family; including the hero Eitumapu'a who climbed a great ironwood tree into the skies and found the love of his life Ilaheva and slept beside her until the two islands Tala-kite and Mata-aho was forged from their love."

On this new land emerged four sets of twins of opposite sexes, and each brother laid with his sister and their divine blood would produce four holy daughters. Our most ancient of ancestors bind all people together, and what better nation to keep the descendants of these people alive than the Tonga? Surely, our network of tributaries and subjects will understand that it is our brotherly and sisterly love of one-another that brings us closest to the ancient gods and ancestors."

When the great hero Maui went to fish in the ocean with this hook, he did not pull a fish from the ocean, but our home island of Tongatapu was dragged up from the bottom of the sea! As Maui continued to fish with this magical hook, he birthed ‘Eua and the many other smaller islands of our great kingdom, and even some of the isles of Fiji and Samoa as well. But it is Tongatapu, the capital island of our nation, that was the first of Maui's islands, and surely the divine nature of our land's birth that will attract even more merchants, settlers, and nobles to our shores."

 polynesian.1.t:0 "Sacred Area Needs a Clearing"
 polynesian.1.d:0 "The exuberance of our land brings us several blessings, but this time, in part due to our carelessness, the forest has almost eaten our [Root.GetPolynesianSacredArea]. Many in our community feel like the place is not tapu or sacred anymore and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should do something about it."
 polynesian.1.a:0 "We will send some men to clear the area and make it tapu again."
 polynesian.1.b:0 "Why would we care? It is just a place with less trees."
 polynesian.2.t:0 "Dances Gone Wrong"
 polynesian.2.d:0 "During one of our many celebrations, while the dancers were performing the traditional [Root.GetPolynesianDance], a fight has started. Accusations of jealousy have been thrown between two dancers. While the matter should not have been anything but an anecdote, it has escalated quite fast and the families of the dancers have started to face each other. Before blood is spilled, [Root.Monarch.GetName] acts."
 polynesian.2.a:0 "Side with one of the dancers."
 polynesian.2.b:0 "Try to solve it diplomatically."
 polynesian.3.t:0 "The Disappeared Fly Whisk"
 polynesian.3.d:0 "All across the Polynesian Triangle, fly whisks are used for ceremonial purposes by our high ranking chiefs. Today our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be the center of a ceremony, but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fly whisk has disappeared and servants cannot find it. There is no time to make another one as the ceremony is about to start. This will cause a great turmoil if not solved."

 polynesian.4.t:0 "Kava Culture"
 polynesian.4.d:0 "By watering the dried roots of the kava plant we get an hallucinogenic beverage called Kava too. Kava is a central part of most ceremonies all across the Polynesian Triangle, and it is a highly ritualized act which follows a strict set of rules and order. As the process of creation of this beverage is not set in stone, the results could vary a lot, leading to different outcomes. The last celebration we had with some important members of our own and neighboring societies was a total success due to the high quality Kava we served. Our fame as hosts has been greatly improved."

One would not think of this as a tool for death, but the human brain is very creative and using a sennit to strangle our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the option thought by the attacker."

 polynesian.8.d:0 "When our ancestors colonized these islands, they brought two animals to eat: chicken and pigs. Pigs are traditionally valued as they are not only delicious, but a big source of meat and owning several of them is a way to show power. Two groups of people have come to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to accuse the other side of stealing pigs from them. This is a hot topic for several reasons, and our ruler might want to act."

 polynesian.9.d:0 "According to our legends, before we arrived these shores, our people were native to a place called Hawaiki, where all of us come from. Even for others it is also the underworld where our dead go and dwell. In any case, they were happy and food was abundant, so our people sometimes miss that place they have never been to. There is an unnatural attraction to that lost homeland."

 polynesian.10.t:0 "A Sweet Menace"
 polynesian.10.d:0 "Sugarcane was brought by our ancestors in our wakas or canoes and has been planted and used extensively by our communities. But with us, an undesired guest also came: the rats. While our dogs are ready to fight them, on this occasion, the number of rats seems to be out of control, and we have suffered great losses in our sugar fields. The community is concerned and has come to beg for help. As rulers, we have to give them an answer."

Pretty much every islander group has their own breed of dog: the Poi in Hawai'i, the Kuri in Aotearoa, or those in Tahiti. When a source of food is needed, dogs are not always the first to fall, but they are fed with vegetables or fish so they are ready."
 polynesian.11.a:0 "Dogs are a good source of food."
 polynesian.12.t:0 "The Waka Race"
 polynesian.12.d:0 "Our people have used wakas or canoes to settle this part of the world and wakas are central to our culture in one way or the other. Competitions are also an easy way to have our people entertained and also a good way to keep our community fit. One group of rowers has challenged another to a race and news of the event has spread quickly across the area. Even [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached the shore to watch the race. Bets have naturally arisen."

 polynesian.13.t:0 "No Husked Candlenut to Be Found"
 polynesian.13.d:0 "Tattoos are a common way to cover our bodies and are always drawn by master tattooists that have an important role in our societies. The ink, called kukui in the Hawaiian Islands or tuitui in Samoa, is made by burning the oily kernel of the husked candlenut and the black soot is collected. For some reason, those husked candlenuts have become scarce and nobody is able to find them anywhere."

Traditionally, the man presents a Tabua or whale's tooth as a gift to her future spouse, but this is not a strict rule. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is about to get married and insists on gifting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new consort a specially luxurious tabua. State coffers might suffer because of this."

 polynesian.18.a:0 "Let's look among these candidates."
 polynesian.19.t:0 "Accusations of Practicing Witchcraft"
 polynesian.19.d:0 "Witchcraft or Draunikau as some refer to is a common way to communicate with the spirits and get favors in return. While many people practice it, even among the Betes or priests, it is viewed as suspicious by most and the practice of it is done stealthily in most cases. Gossips that [Root.Monarch.GetName] practices it has run free all across the realm."
 polynesian.19.a:0 "This gossip must end."
 polynesian.19.b:0 "Everyone does, perhaps we should normalize it."
 polynesian.20.t:0 "Living Target"
 polynesian.20.d:0 "Our heir needs to be a great warrior if [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] wants to lead our people one day. It is a tradition among our people to practice archery skills against a living target, usually a severely injured captive of war. By allowing our children to aim at a living target, we ensure that their skills are good for future wars. In this occasion, our heir is among those children. This will make a warrior of [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]"

Only children and those connected to them somehow are able to see them. Today, a man has come to the village claiming that he saw them."

But from time to time, the Gods put a test of faith to our people, the Earth becomes angry and the volcanoes that form our islands throw lava that covers our fields.

It is a very traditional and iconic part of our culture. To our surprise, the dance has been accompanied by some kind of acting.
