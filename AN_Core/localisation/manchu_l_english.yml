The man tasked with defending the Shanghai Pass is Wu Sangui, a talented and ambitious commander who has faced [Root.Culture.GetName] armies in battle before with some success. Recent events in the capital and beyond have shaken his loyalty to the Ming [MNG.Monarch.GetTitle], and now he seeks an unlikely alliance with his former enemies.

The cost of all this would bankrupt all but the wealthiest lords, preventing them from accumulating the funds they would need to maintain a private army.

 flavor_kor.7.d:1 "With the fall of Kyoto, the Japanese Shogunate lies in ruins. The Korean troops have entered the city and systematically sacked it, finally releasing the pent-up animosity built up over generations of conflict between Korea and Japan as the city's survivors weep and cower. In the process, they have accumulated an incredibly rich hoard of loot, the majority of which will filter back to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nChief among the artifacts taken is the Chrysanthemum Throne, upon which Japanese Emperors have sat since the 7th century. [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has decreed that it shall be taken to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and be given pride of place on display among the treasures of the Korean [Root.GovernmentName]."

 flavor_kor.2.desc_new:0 "While serving as Third Censor in [GetYear], the Neo-Confucian Kim Il-son, a former state historian, proved himself to be a man willing to go to great lengths in criticizing government officials and the yangban elite. His many opponents have uncovered certain allusions made in his draft of the Annals of King Seongjong which they insist to be treasonous. They demand his immediate execution, and that his supporters among the Neo-Confucians be either banished or executed."

 flavor_kor.2.C:0 "We must maintain the political balance."
 flavor_kor.3.desc_new:2 "During the course of a state banquet on [GetDateText], Minister of Rites Yi Se-jwa spilled wine on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s robes. Coming as it does after a period of intense factional rivalry and criticism of royal authority, Yi Se-jwa's opponents have been quick to interpret the occurrence as a crime against the sovereign and therefore treasonous. They demand the purge of Yi Se-jwa and his many allies, who cut across factions. Indeed, this appears to present a golden opportunity to rid the government of those who would question royal authority."
 flavor_kor.3.A:0 "Purge all those who oppose us."
 flavor_kor.3.B:0 "We must maintain the political balance."
 flavor_kor.4.desc_new:0 "Cho Kwang-jo, a Neo-Confucian reformer, has been attempting to shape the government according to Confucian ideals. His initial successes in reformation appear however to have backfired after he went too far in attacking the old order of the yangban, weakening their hold on power by securing the preponderance of Neo-Confucians in the government and enraging them through proposed land confiscations.\n\nThe yangban now claim Cho Kwang-jo to be a traitor who is planning to attempt to enthrone himself, as well as arguing that his reforms are misguided and will harm society and the very foundations of the state. For his part, Cho Kwang-jo insists that the only correct course of action is to continue the reforms with all haste, despite the opposition. Who should we side with?"
 flavor_kor.4.A:0 "Purge the Neo-Confucians!"
 flavor_kor.4.B:0 "The reforms must continue - whatever it takes!"
 flavor_kor.8.t:0 "Peasant Upheaval in Korea"
 flavor_kor.8.d:0 "The rural poor have been struggling in recent times. Not only are they taxed far beyond their capacity to pay and still support themselves, but if they flee the land to escape tax obligations, these are transferred to their kin who remain behind, leading to even greater tax burdens. What is more, the yangban elite have increasingly been acquiring land for themselves, pushing out the rural poor. This has led to a general climate of lawlessness and unrest among the peasantry that, if left unchecked, could pose a significant threat to the state."

Our authorities in the region are appealing to us to help them deal with the crisis."
 flavor_kor.9.opt:0 "We will crush these peasants."
 flavor_kor.10.t:0 "The Rise of the Neo-Confucians"
 flavor_kor.10.d:2 "In the late 15th and early 16th century, the previous political stability of the Joseon Korean [Root.GovernmentName] was disrupted by the emergence of a new group known as the Neo-Confucians. These were scholars from the countryside who had not traditionally been part of the conservative yangban elite that governed the country. Their obvious merits encouraged the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s to employ them in government; however, their reformist notions along with competition with the yangban establishment for land and positions led to ever more frequent clashes between the different factions in Korean politics."

 string_start_korea:1 "The §YJoseon Kingdom of Korea§!, officially the §YKingdom of Great Joseon§!, emerged from the ashes of §YMongol§! and §YMing§! invasions via a coup d'état by General §YYi Seonggye§! (later known as §YKing Taejo§!) in 1392. From the start, Joseon Korea's connection to §YMing China§! was strong: When settling on a name for the new kingdom, Taejo submitted the options 'Hwaryeong' and 'Joseon' to Ming and decided on the latter after its endorsement by the Emperor.\n\nThis close connection to §YMing China§! was to remain until the downfall of the Ming in the mid-17th century - as was Korea's subordinate status in the relationship. As followers of §YConfucianism§!, Koreans viewed China as being at the heart of the Korean world, and Joseon Korea came to be in some ways even more sinicized than China itself - a 'little China'. For their part, the Chinese viewed Joseon Korea as the 'country of courteous people in the East'. For as long as Ming remains the undisputed claimant to the §YMandate of Heaven§!, the maintenance of these strong bonds will remain vital to the survival of the fledgling Korean kingdom.\n\nThe achievements of the first century of §YJoseon§! rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the border regions of §YGyeongseong§! and §YYukjin§! were taken from the §YJurchens§!, allowing the Koreans to unite the territory which would form modern-day Korea. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the hangeul alphabet was introduced in 1446. Unlike the Chinese alphabet, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gunpowder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and record the geography of the land.\n\nHowever, threats to the Korean kingdom remain from both within and beyond its borders. At home, Korea's peasants remain poor, and both §Ypeasant uprisings§! and insufficient tax receipts are likely to become a problem if nothing is done to rectify the situation. Furthermore, although the upper class of §Yyangban elites§! has for the most part been united, the cracks in this façade are already beginning to show and could erupt into §Yfactional strife§! at any time.\n\nOn the foreign front lie threats aplenty. To the north await the warlike §YJurchens§! - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, an invasion of Korea might follow swiftly. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies §YJapan§!, a nation of warring §Ydaimyos§! and would-be §Yshoguns§!. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan seek to expand its power across the narrow channel of the Korean Sea. Finally, although Korea basks in the shadow of the §YMing Empire§!, woe betide the Joseon prince who wakes the dragon!"
 string_start_jurchens:2 "The Han know well the dangers of allowing the §YJurchens§! to unite. In the 12th century the Jurchen warlord §YAguda§! united the Jurchens in rebellion against the §YLiao§!, founding the state of §YJin§! and crowning himself §YEmperor Taizu§!. The §YMing§! dynasty wishes to avoid another Jurchen uprising, and takes measures to ensure that they continue to fight among themselves with no faction becoming too powerful. To that end, Ming has established a loose overlordship over the §YJianzhou§! and §YHaixi§! Jurchens.\n\nOf the Jurchen tribes the Jianzhou are by far the most powerful. Like the Haixi they are a settled people; the institutions and philosophies of Chinese rule are slowly spreading into the region and being embraced by local Khans.\n\nDespite the encroachment of Chinese rule and customs, the settled Jurchens retain most of the same traditions and the warrior-culture of the ‘Wild Jurchens’ to the north. The nomadic tribes of §YXibe§!, §YNanai§!, and §YOrochoni§! are far from powerless, and have to contend only with each other and the relatively isolated §YSolon§! and §YNikvh§! peoples.\n\n§YKorea§! often finds itself at odds with the Jurchens, and has only recently annexed the north-eastern provinces of §YYukjin§! and §YGyeongseong§! from a branch of the Jianzhou. Both the Jurchens and Koreans consider §YPaektu Mountain§! to be a sacred place, and each believe that they alone should have access to the holy peak.\n\nThe Jurchens and the §YMongols§! have an ever-changing relationship. Sometimes allies and sometimes bitter rivals, the tribes of both people often intermarry to secure political ties, and dynastic feuding is common. The §YKorchin§! Mongols under §YKhan Unebolad§! have become ascendent in the east and may set their sights on expanding into Jurchen land if they are not contained.\n\nThe Jurchen Khans remember the days of Jin fondly. If they are able to overcome the divisions between the tribes and keep the Mongols at bay they may yet rise again under a new leader, defeat the Ming, and forge for themselves a new identity."
