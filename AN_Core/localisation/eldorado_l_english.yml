 exploration_events.1.d:0 "During our mission to find viable provinces to colonize, we stumbled upon $PROVINCENAME$. Its natives are mostly hostile, but the land is very prosperous. We would gain much from trading with this province. Although we might need to bribe a chief or two..."

 exploration_events.2.t:0 "$PROVINCENAME$ Troopers"
 exploration_events.2.d:0 "Our expedition encountered hostile natives from $PROVINCENAME$ which led them to flee from the province. A few of the crew had disembarked to find fresh water and were returning to the ship when five native canoes with armed men appeared. The crew turned their boat around and raced back to the boat with the canoes just behind. One of the canoes nearly caught up with the boat, but as the men prepared for a fight the canoe slowed down as to wait for the others. The ship escaped, but some of the crew were wounded. A poisoned arrow hit one of the men in the leg, and although the wound was disinfected with urine and olive oil, we do not know if the man will survive."

 exploration_events.3.d:1 "As our ship approaches $PROVINCENAME$ large numbers of gift laden canoes start to follow it. The canoes' occupants have fearlessly boarded the vessel and two seemingly important fellows are trying to persuade the ship's captain to follow them to [tribal_nation.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Their intentions seem innocent and we can espy from the few words our translator can pick out that we have arrived just in time for a festival of some sort. Our ship's mast formation, sails and rigging resemble certain significant artefacts for the natives and our clockwise route around the island mirrored the path the processions take during this festival. This has convinced the natives that we are friendly but one false move and it might change..."
 exploration_events.3.a:0 "Accept their primitive traditions."
 exploration_events.3.b:0 "Stay clear of them and do not make landfall!"
 exploration_events.4.t:0 "Glory Road"
 exploration_events.4.d:0 "The lookout had reported signs of dwellings but the ship had yet to see any natives until at long last a coastal village in $PROVINCENAME$ was sighted. A small force disembarked and was hospitably received, something that was attributed to the natives' fascination with the men who were taller in stature than them and bearded. The natives were beardless and with some difficulty they managed to communicate that their myths and legends foretold of a time when their bearded gods would come from the sea to visit them. Food and gold were given, which indicates that the province is prosperous and would be of great value to us."
 exploration_events.4.a:0 "This is a promising land!"
 exploration_events.5.t:0 "The Ship into Summer"
 exploration_events.5.d:0 "The words of Christopher Columbus describe the tribe we found in $PROVINCENAME$ perfectly: 'They traded with us and gave us everything they had, with good will... they took great delight in pleasing us.. They are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil, nor do they murder or steal... Your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people... They love their neighbors as themselves, and they have the sweetest talk in the world, and are gentle and always laughing.'"
 exploration_events.5.a:0 "Take advantage of them!"
 exploration_events.5.b:0 "Make good use of their gentle ways."
 exploration_events.6.t:0 "Unwelcome Passenger"
 exploration_events.6.d:0 "The village had been abandoned for some time, the failing crops spoke of a drought that must have plagued the province for quite some time. As we returned to our ship, we got a dreadful shock: one of the largest bears we've ever seen trying to climb aboard the ship! The seamen decided to capture the starved beast with the hope of bringing it back to our country, but the bear had other plans. It was leashed and brought aboard the ship, but the bear fought itself free of the ropes and we had to kill it. This attack and the devastated state $PROVINCENAME$ is in has made us realize that it is a lost cause."
 exploration_events.6.a:0 "A real shame."
 exploration_events.7.t:0 "The Green Hills of $PROVINCENAME$"
 exploration_events.7.d:0 "The natives in $PROVINCENAME$ were enthralled by the glass beads, brass bells, and cloth our explorers traded for fresh fish and venison. In their report to us the ship's crew spoke about that there was very little wealth among the people and they seemed peaceful. Some events troubled them, as the villagers for some reason deserted their homes one night and left the village to be explored by the members of the expedition. Nothing much was found, only a small rattle made of gold buried among some fishing nets bore witness that this province might yield some fortune for us."
 exploration_events.7.a:0 "How great!"
 exploration_events.8.t:0 "Beyond This Horizon"
 exploration_events.8.d:0 "As our exploration ship idled off the coast of $PROVINCENAME$, a couple of curious natives in canoes paddled out to the ship. The crew invited the natives aboard after gestures were exchanged that expressed peaceful intentions. Food and drink were shared with the natives before they set back into their canoes and returned to $PROVINCENAME$. Encouraged by the report of the initial pacific encounter, six more canoes decided to paddle out to the caravel."
 exploration_events.8.a:0 "Invite them again."
 exploration_events.8.b:0 "Capture them!"
 exploration_events.9.t:0 "The Menace from $PROVINCENAME$"
 exploration_events.9.d:0 "After a rather turbulent beginning with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ we finally managed to convince them of our good intentions. As we made landfall two men, one old and one young, approached our ship. They were not interested in our gifts and when a musket was fired over their heads to make them back away, it wounded the older man slightly. He ran to their huts and brought men who threw spears at our crew until they were chased off after two more rounds were fired. The adults fled into the woods, leaving their children behind. Some small trinkets and beads were left behind with the children as a gesture of friendship before the expedition members retreated to the ship."
 exploration_events.9.a:0 "Make them understand we meant them no harm."
 exploration_events.9.b:0 "If they return - kill them!"
 exploration_events.10.t:0 "The $PROVINCENAME$ Beasts"
 exploration_events.10.d:0 "Before we went on the expedition, we had heard tales of an explorer by the name of Hanno who had found an island populated with a 'hirsute and savage people'. Hanno had made attempts to capture the males which failed, but three females were taken. Their ferocious nature forced the explorer to kill them and to bring proof of this savages, their skins were preserved for transport. These people were called 'gorillae' by the interpreters traveling with Hanno. We assume that the apelike specie we found in $PROVINCENAME$ must be these Gorillae Hanno spoke of."
 exploration_events.10.a:0 "They can be tamed with some baubles."

 exploration_events.11.t:0 "A Scattering of Poison"
 exploration_events.11.d:0 "The expedition was closing in on $PROVINCENAME$ when a barrage of arrows, shot from the natives standing on the inviting beach, assailed the ship. In the hurry to race away from the enemy, who leapt with great whoops towards their canoes, the crew had to abandon some of the men who had been shot and tumbled overboard. When they had laid some sea miles between $PROVINCENAME$ and themselves, they discovered that the whole starboard side of the ship was covered in arrows.\nThe explorer on board the assailed ship was seriously wounded, the arrow that hit him had been poisoned. He lay in fever, sweating and swearing, for several days. Despite the surgeon's care and the disinfectant made of urine and olive oil, he died some time ago."
 exploration_events.11.a:0 "Such a horrible fate!"
 exploration_events.12.t:0 "Drunken Explorer"
 exploration_events.12.d:0 "One of our expedition members - our explorer, of all people! - managed to get himself into a dreadfully embarrassing situation when he overestimated his own capability of handling the fruity liquor the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ brew. Disgusting details won't make it into this report, but he was sick as a pig for a long time. The natives thought it fun, laughing at his misery, but the rumors of this event has reached the ears of the high socialites who frown upon such behavior."
 exploration_events.12.a:0 "Fruity liquor? Did you bring some back?"
 exploration_events.13.t:0 "Feathery Meals"
 exploration_events.13.d:0 "The only residents of $PROVINCENAME$ seem to be birds, birds, and more birds. The large birds, nicknamed 'penguins' by the ship's crew due to their small wings, seem to be fearless of us. The first one we caught stared at us and could not be bothered to fly or run away. When we grabbed it by its leg and held it upside-down, it made a great noise. The flock of penguins around us came running to its assistance and tried to bite us with their large beaks. Our provisions are low and these birds are fat and look good enough to eat."
 exploration_events.13.a:0 "Leave the birds alone."
 exploration_events.13.b:0 "If it moves - eat it!"
 exploration_events.14.t:0 "Unexpected Explorer"
 exploration_events.14.d:0 "As the ship entered the bay of $PROVINCENAME$, a small crowd of natives had gathered on the beach and were silently regarding the expedition. The ship's mate jumped into a spontaneous and cheerful dance to the accompaniment of pipes. The natives started laughing which broke the tension. Food and drink was brought down to the beach for them all to feast upon. One of the natives showed great interest in the ship, the swords, and other pieces of equipment brought by one of the expedition members. With the help of the translator, the young woman spoke of her knowledge of the nearby islands and of her great desire to see more of the world."
 exploration_events.14.a:0 "Bring her with you and make an explorer out of her."
 exploration_events.14.b:0 "It is better for her to stay where she is."
 exploration_events.15.t:0 "Dead on Arrival"
 exploration_events.15.d:0 "The life on board a ship is a lonesome one. In a few provinces the expeditions visited there were no shortage of willing arms to embrace and staunch the loneliness for a little while. Overly close contact with the natives may have caused the explorer's death, as he caught a strange disease which rapidly deteriorated his condition and led to heart failure. He was given a burial at sea, not far from $PROVINCENAME$."
 exploration_events.15.a:0 "Rest in peace."

 exploration_events.16.d:0 "Our fleet set sail to find a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. It took them 99 days to cross the ocean westward, after they had found the Strait of Magellan located near the tip of South America. The strait was treacherous and when they finally reached the ocean, the captain wept with joy. The ocean was so strangely calm it was named 'Pacific', from the Latin word for 'Tranquil'.\n\nThe fleet's captain died from a wound caused by a poisoned arrow when assisting the chief of Cebú in conquering a rival tribe. Two of our ships had survived, one tried to return across the Pacific but perished. The last ship continued west and sailed across the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and as it arrived at our port it became the first ship to circumnavigate the globe."

It took them many days to cross the ocean westward, after they had found the Indonesian Islands.\n\nThe fleet's captain died from a wound caused by a poisoned arrow when assisting a local chief in conquering a rival tribe. Two of our ships had survived, one tried to return across the open sea but perished.

 exploration_events.21.d:0 "After a long voyage, our Imperial Fleet has discovered a sea route from the Middle Kingdom and back again, a route circumnavigating the entire globe! It took our explorers 49 days to reach the land of Five Inds, and another 49 days to Tianfang - known locally as Mecca. From there, they sailed for another 7 weeks into the Great Western Ocean the barbarians call the Atlantic until reaching the Americas. A continent we are told is named after a certain savage chief. After 99 days our fleet managed to find a route around this continent into another ocean. An ocean so calm, they decided to name it Taiping - the tranquil one, to celebrate the peaceful world under the Son of Heaven's rule!\n\nThe Fleet's captain and many other sailors died of exotic illness during the voyage over the Taiping Ocean, but most of our ships survived to eventually find themselves approaching the Land of Rising Sun. After a short last leg our glorious Fleet became the first one to circumnavigate the globe as it arrived back in its own home port."

Our most favored navigators departed from Kostantiniyye in the month of Muharrem, intent on expanding our knowledge about the world. Upon reaching the New Clime they demonstrated this continent's limits by bypassing it to the south, and arrived in the great ocean separating it from the land of Hitay. This they named el-Bahrü's-selam in honor of its peaceful nature. From there they visited the lands of Java and Hind, and informed the local Believers of the power of my Sublime State – it is said that my felicitous name is even mentioned in their Friday prayers. Under the protection of Allah the Exalted, they returned to us by way of Egypt. Let this event serve as a clear demonstration of the might and reach of the House of Osman across all the Seven Climes, and let the ambassadors of foreign nations hear also of our lofty achievements.\n\nRecorded in the first trimester of the noble month of Ramadan, in Kostantiniyye, the Well-Protected."
 exploration_events.23.d:0 "Up until now we have believed that the world is made up of three big regions: Japan, China and India. Recently we have also learned of the 'Nanban' civilization of Southern Barbarians and in order to contact them directly beyond the high seas, we organized a grand expedition. Our fleet explored tropical islands in the south and met people with exotic customs in the west. Our ships sailed between drift ices in the north and discovered unknown continents and islands in the east.\nAs the greatest result of this expedition, our sailors have been the first in the world to circumnavigate the globe! The Emperor was very pleased with our achievement when our ships finally returned to home. His Highness invited the commander in chief and other crew members of the fleet to the Imperial Court and held a glorious audience the like of which hasn't been recorded before. This event will be remembered as the memorial day for when Japan rose to dominate the seven seas."

 seven_cities_events.208.d:0 "Wealth comes in many different packages and ways - some claim that the wealth of heart is to be desired, others that piety and prestige should be the only wealth in life. Gold and precious stones is the only wealth our heart desires, and the Golden City of Cibola in $PROVINCENAME$ has made this desire grow fiercely. For every ounce of gold, for every handful of gems we want more and Cibola keeps on giving. One of the Seven Cities of Gold is ours, and we intend to keep it."
 seven_cities_events.208.a:0 "It is ours, our precious..."
 seven_cities_events.209.t:0 "City of the Caesars - False Gold"
 seven_cities_events.209.d:0 "Everything that glimmers is not gold - something our conquistador learned the hard way. The expedition claimed to have found the City of the Caesars in $PROVINCENAME$, a golden city located between two mountains of gold and diamonds. Sadly, the 'gold' was mere pyrite and the 'diamonds' were quartz."
 seven_cities_events.209.a:0 "I would have preferred something more... precious."
 seven_cities_events.210.t:0 "City of the Caesars - True Silver"
 seven_cities_events.210.d:0 "Mountains of gold and diamonds, and beneath it one of the Seven Cities of Gold... The mountains were only two small hills in $PROVINCENAME$. They held some precious metal and stones, but the metal was not the color of the sun but the color of the moon - a handful of silver and quartz was all the conquistador could find."
 seven_cities_events.210.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
 seven_cities_events.211.t:0 "The City of the Caesars - Mountains of Wealth"
 seven_cities_events.211.d:0 "Between the two large mountains of gold and diamonds in $PROVINCENAME$ lie the City of the Caesars, a prosperous city filled with everything you could wish. Food and drink aplenty, eaten and drunk from gold plates rimmed with precious stones. We have found it and claimed it, and we will be rich when all that wealth has been transported home."
 seven_cities_events.211.a:0 "Just think about all that gold and prestige this will bring!"

 seven_cities_events.212.a:0 "It was too good to be true."
 seven_cities_events.213.t:0 "Sierra de la Plata - Close, but no Silver"
 seven_cities_events.213.d:0 "Not a mountain of silver, not one of the Seven Cities of Gold, but Sierra de la Plata was a true legend found by us - finally! It was located in $PROVINCENAME$ and an adequate amount of silver is being brought back each month to us."
 seven_cities_events.213.a:0 "Good!"
 seven_cities_events.214.t:0 "Sierra de la Plata - Mountain of Silver"
 seven_cities_events.214.d:0 "Beneath a large mountain filled with silver a White King resides. Sierra de la Plata - Mountains of Silver - has grown from a legend to a real city in $PROVINCENAME$ and we were the first civilized people to find it! Rejoice, for we have found a place of immense wealth and a people so gullible we will have no problem taking what we want, nay, what we need!"
 seven_cities_events.214.a:0 "Great!"
 seven_cities_events.215.t:0 "No Trace of Norumbega"
 seven_cities_events.215.d:0 "The city of Norumbega must be a hoax made up by the French navigator who claimed to have discovered it. The only 40-leagues-wide river is devoid of islands and there is no sign of a town farther up. We have been gullible enough to believe something as preposterous as a Viking settlement and wasted time to try and find it."
 seven_cities_events.215.a:0 "Too bad..."
 seven_cities_events.216.t:0 "Disappointing Norumbega"
 seven_cities_events.216.d:0 "The town lay exactly where the French navigator had reported, at the mouth of a river 40 leagues wide. There was no sight of the tall, handsome and clever inhabitants he had spoken of, but the natives were very friendly and had lots of furs and sable to trade."
 seven_cities_events.216.a:0 "I had expected more."
 seven_cities_events.217.t:0 "Norumbega Discovered"
 seven_cities_events.217.d:0 "The people of Norumbega are tall, clever and handsome, with a language which shares a lot of words with Latin. We had hoped for a small town with some gold and furs, but Norumbega far exceeded all our expectations with its rich land, gold mine, and fur trade. It is an old Viking settlement, so much have we gathered from the people, and they are willing to trade with us. The gold mine seems to contain an endless stream of gold and as long as we provide our own work force, we are allowed to mine it."

 seven_cities_events.218.d:0 "Charts painted with great care, landmarks discovered and natives guiding us, despite all this we have come no closer to finding the Kingdom of Saguenay. This is a hopeless quest, there is nothing of value in the north-west of the Americas. Let the conquistador come back home, or send the expedition out to search for something more tangible, something that is more than a myth or legend told by ignorant and savage natives."

 seven_cities_events.219.t:0 "Hoax by Indians - Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.219.d:0 "As the expedition neared its destination - the legendary Kingdom of Saguenay, on par with any of the Seven Cities of Gold - El Dorado included - the anticipation grew with every step. Silver mines, ruby mines and gold mines - the mere thought of the treasures awaiting made most of the crew salivate. The first sight was a palisade encircling the town and smiles of greed was plastered on every face. These were soon exchanged for looks of disbeliefs and hearts turning to stone in their chests. The inhabitants were not white, were not clad in similar clothes to us and were certainly not wealthy. It was yet another tribe of natives, with more riches than most but this was no City of Gold."
 seven_cities_events.219.a:0 "They are willing to trade, that is something at least."
 seven_cities_events.220.t:0 "The Discovery of the Kingdom of Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.220.d:0 "The expedition was greeted with great hospitality by the white inhabitants of the Kingdom of Saguenay. They told a saga of having traveled on great boats some hundred years ago or so to Vinland as they call this continent. Gold, silver and ruby mines were soon found and tribes around became interested in their findings, leading the Saguenais to build up a reputation as fierce and brutal warriors. They reluctantly shared their wealth with us after we showed our superiority with guns and swords."

 seven_cities_events.221.d:0 "'The Turk' filled the conquistador's ears with tales of the wealthy city of Quivira, of the fat land well watered by springs and rivers, the gold that adorned the houses and the fat, happy people. What the expedition found, however, was just more farming people living in a flat-roofed adobe town!"
 seven_cities_events.221.a:0 "The Turk should be strangled for his lies!"
 seven_cities_events.222.t:0 "Fruitful City"
 seven_cities_events.222.d:0 "Quivira is a well settled town, with the land itself being very flat and black. Rivulets, springs and rivers ensure that it is well watered. Prunes, nuts, sweet grapes, and mulberries were found in excess. There are abundant jade deposits in the caves, but no gold at all. The legendary city exists, and although wealthy, it is not how we were told to picture it."
 seven_cities_events.222.a:0 "At least we found it."
 seven_cities_events.223.t:0 "Legendary City of Quivira"
 seven_cities_events.223.d:0 "Golden cups hang from the trees in the city of Quivira and anyone who is thirsty may take one and fill it with sweet water from one of the many springs, rivers, and rivulets that keep the area well watered. Prunes, nuts, mulberries, and sweet grapes bigger than anyone has ever seen must be the reason behind the large people of good build that inhabits the city. Gold and jade in great deposits in caves ensure the wealth of the city."

The woman speaks several languages while her husband is a good hunter with great knowledge of this continent."

Luckily for him, the chief's dearest daughter rushed forth and placed her head upon his to save him from death."

 seven_cities_events.302.t:0 "Attacked by Natives"
 seven_cities_events.302.d:0 "Tragic news: our conquistador is dead! The expedition was traveling upriver by canoe when they encountered natives. The warlike tribe demanded that they come ashore and some of the men complied. They were disarmed and stripped naked, something our conquistador objected to. He refused the orders and died riddled with bullets. The expedition members saw his body brought ashore and hacked to pieces. Only one survived, who was told to leave and run. The natives pursued him and he ran for his life. Naked, exhausted and bleeding, the survivor had only one assailant pursuing him after several miles. He managed to overcome the lone man and found shelter in $PROVINCENAME$."
 seven_cities_events.302.a:0 "How terrible!"
 seven_cities_events.303.t:0 "Lost in Mind and Space"
 seven_cities_events.303.d:0 "We should have realized that our conquistador had no sense of orientation at all the first two times he got lost. The first time, he went to retrieve two of our pack horses and got lost for sixteen days. If it hadn't been for some grapes and rabbits, he would have starved. He later told us that he thought he was behind the expedition and sped up to catch up with it, then he got hungry so he went downstream to look for a trading party. The expedition sent their best hunter to find him and were finally reunited with him. The second time he explored one of three forks of a river and disappeared for three days. Once again the expedition sent the seasoned hunter to find him and he told a tale of trying to backtrack the forks and following our trails. This made the crew decide that the conquistador would not be left alone to discover more parts of $PROVINCENAME$, but that still did not help. Only mere minutes later he was gone again."

A beaver had bit him so badly that the expedition's doctor had to perform surgery on his hind leg. Mosquitoes plagued the expedition and the dog had howled with the torture experienced by them. Natives in $PROVINCENAME$ had stolen Seaman but he was retrieved shortly. Our conquistador has grown fond of the dog and would be devastated if anything happened to him."

 seven_cities_events.306.d:1 "The [Root.Owner.GetName] and [rival_tribe.GetName] tribes are rivals, something our conquistador didn't realize until too late. They both demanded tribute from the expedition to allow them passage. By offering one native chief gifts first, our conquistador insulted and angered the other chief. The gifts offered were not to the chiefs' satisfaction and some warriors tried to take the expedition's provisions. The conquistador took a firm stand, and he and his second in command brandished their swords and threatened violence. The chiefs backed down and better gifts were presented to them both."

As they are exploring provinces that have an unknown flora and fauna to us, it would be unwise to eat anything as it could be poisonous. Maybe we should try to establish contact with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ and ask for their help?"

 seven_cities_events.308.d:0 "In $PROVINCENAME$ there are two small tribes with a very special arrangement: The women live by themselves, far from the men who they only allow to visit them a couple of times each year. Any boy child fathered this way is returned to the father and the girls are kept by the women. If approached at any other time than is appointed, the women will defend themselves with bows and arrows. The men of the strange tribe are currently preparing for the next visit, and have invited the male expedition members to join them."

 seven_cities_events.400.d:0 "The expedition started with 600 men, but only four made it home alive. When they first arrived, the crew heard about another expedition where 450 of 600 men had perished. Fearing that they would face the same fate, many deserted. A hurricane struck the expedition not long after, and several men perished. Disaster after disaster struck the expedition, famine, disease and attacks from the natives. One of the four who returned home was Estevanico, a black slave born in Africa, who was taught by the conquistador the necessary skills to lead an expedition. He is available for hire, although we would suffer a small prestige hit if we appoint him our new conquistador."

Our expedition helped bury the bodies while several scouts searched the area for any signs of the attackers. A few clues led toward the Peralta gold mine and as they approached it became clear that the attackers had taken shelter in the mines. One of the Peraltas confirmed that it was the same group that had attacked them. After a violent battle, the enemy lay dead on the ground outside the mine. The Peralta family kept their word and rewarded us with a large amount of gold."

 seven_cities_events.404.d:0 "The bodies of the fallen Peralta family members had been savaged, which made it difficult to identify them. Burying them took precious time, and the scout sent out to search the surrounding areas for the attackers returned with nothing. The oldest son of the Peraltas, one of the few survivors, refused to give up. He led the expedition towards the Peralta gold mine, in case the attackers had found their way there. As they approached the mine, their fears were confirmed. The mine is no more, the attackers buried it in rubble and the gold is lost. The Peralta family was avenged, as the large group of attackers were taken by surprise and easily killed."

 seven_cities_events.405.d:0 "We would never had discovered that Baret was a woman had the natives not shouted it at the top of their lungs when the expedition entered $PROVINCENAME$. She had joined us as an assistant to our naturalist and as his ulcerated leg had brought him much discomfort, she had carried supplies and specimens in his stead. Baret claims to be our naturalist's housekeeper, but their relationship seems deeper than that. Should we allow her to remain with us on the expedition?"
 seven_cities_events.405.a:0 "Yes, allow her to stay."
 seven_cities_events.405.b:0 "No, send her back!"
 seven_cities_events.406.t:0 "Poison Rock"
 seven_cities_events.406.d:0 "Nine horses died from eating poisonous plants, and the expedition was forced to leave behind two more who were near death. A cursed place with only poisonous plants and venomous animals and the conquistador regrets that they ever decided to camp there. A large rock formation provided shelter from the harsh winds that blew right through them, but Poison Rock, as it was named by the conquistador, is not a place for any man nor animal."
 seven_cities_events.406.a:0 "Continue on foot if you have to!"
 seven_cities_events.407.t:0 "False as diamonds of $PROVINCENAME$"
 seven_cities_events.407.d:0 "Our explorer has sent us gems he claims to have found in $PROVINCENAME$. White and glittering, he believes them to be diamond, but our learned scholars tell us that they are common quartz instead. Far from a source of wealth, they have become a source of ridicule..."

 seven_cities_events.408.t:0 "A Deserter Resurfaces!"
 seven_cities_events.408.d:0 "Words from our conquistador warned us that one of his trusted lieutenants had defected in despair at the state of the expedition. Our conquistador thought we had seen the last of this deserter, but our agents inform us that he has resurfaced and is peddling his charts to the merchants and explorers of our rival..."

 seven_cities_events.410.t:0 "Abandoned Mounds"
 seven_cities_events.410.d:0 "From a distance, our conquistadors thought them to be mere hills standing among the otherwise empty plain in $PROVINCENAME$. But as we drew nearer, an enterprising fellow in the company noticed how regular they were, and he soon pointed out to his companions that they must be the remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people."

 seven_cities_events.413.d:0 "The paint on the great rock that dominates the river is almost faded, but the six-legged, monster it displays is still visible. Our natives tell us a fanciful tale of a dragon-like monster slain by their ancestors, but some of them confusedly insist the painting to be a warning that we should not head further. What is certain is that all of our native guides insist on discharging their weapons at the painted figure as we pass by it."

While they are pleased that the institution as such was not changed they are abhorred by the kind of people that now have the hereditary right to guard the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. These men are not fit to be part of the high aristocracy of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.33.a:0 "Revert the decision to expand the Guard."
 inti_events.33.b:0 "Give it a generation or two."
 inti_events.34.t:0 "Attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 inti_events.34.d:0 "During the customary serving of beverages to the commoners from around the royal litter in the squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] today [Root.Monarch.GetName] was attacked by a small group of would-be assassins. The group suddenly retreated without being anywhere near achieving the goal of hurting [Root.Monarch.GetName], but it was worryingly clear that the royal guards never saw this coming. Perhaps because they are not yet used to the bustling environment of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.34.a:0 "Revert the decision to expand the Guard."
 inti_events.34.b:0 "This seems a bit too convenient..."
 inti_events.34.b.tt:0 "Start an investigation into who planned the attack."
 inti_events.35.t:0 "Investigation Stalled"
 inti_events.35.d:0 "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] never had much to go on and it has been hard to get people to cooperate, especially among the nobility. While the investigator seems to suspect that this was the work of some discontent sons of the aristocracy we can never know for sure."
 inti_events.35.a:0 "Ok."
 inti_events.36.t:0 "Plot Uncovered"
 inti_events.36.d:0 "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has uncovered an amateurish plot by a group of young nobles from the families that felt marginalized in the royal guard. They claim that the attack was never intended to harm anyone, just point towards the weaknesses of the new additions to the guard. The punishment for treason is clearly death but the nobility of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] would clearly not feel any less threatened if we killed their sons. If we forgive them the transgression perhaps that will be the end of this."
