 ###ETH FLAVOR EVENTS###
 flavor_eth.29.t:0 "The Itinerant Capital of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_eth.29.desc:1 "[Root.GetName]'s capital was never constant as the Negusa Nagasts of [Root.GetName] moved their court to the areas they saw necessary. While this system ensured that the local area around the new capital was under Solomonic thumb, the remaining provinces of [Root.GetName] were mostly autonomous, resulting in a loss of control of these areas."
 flavor_eth.29.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.30.t:0 "Establishment of a Permanent Capital"
 flavor_eth.30.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] modernized the state of [Root.GetName] and founded the first capital in [Root.Capital.GetName] in the year [GetYear]. Additionally, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] resolved the religious arguments, which dragged important decisions out, and centralized the government. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] achievements will be remembered in [Root.GetAdjective] history forever."
 flavor_eth.30.a:0 "Finally. Itinerant capitals are no more."
 flavor_eth.30.b:0 "I like the moving capital though."
 flavor_eth.33.t:0 "Opening of the Ark of the Covenant"
 flavor_eth.33.desc:1 "Over thousands of years nobody opened the real Ark of the Covenant. Because of that, the content of the Ark has been a mystery for the usual believer and even for the clergy this event is one of its kind. To reduce potential panic in the nation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to open this legendary artifact in the palace, far away from the prying eyes of the masses.\nWhen our graceful [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] close ones opened the gold-covered wooden chest, they found what had been promised: two ancient stone tablets of the Ten Commandments as well as Aaron's rod and a pot of manna. It wasn't the most spectacular event, but it was one of devotion. After confirming the authenticity of these artifacts, the clergy placed them back into the chest and hid the Ark of the Covenant again.\n\nDays have passed from this event and ever since many activities have felt more ... easy for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It is as if God himself blessed our glorious dynasty and the fortune of our nation!"
 flavor_eth.33.a:0 "May God the Father bless us, may Christ take care of us!"
 flavor_eth.35.t:0 "The Subjects of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_eth.35.desc:1 "Damot and Hadiya have been vassals of our glorious [Root.GovernmentName] for over 100 years. While their contribution in the form of tribute has served us well, many at [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court argue that their time has come to fully join [Root.GetName]. In the end, it is up to our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide what shall happen with these two nations."
 flavor_eth.35.a:0 "They shall become part of our nation!"
 flavor_eth.35.b:0 "They are more useful as vassals."
 flavor_eth.37.t:0 "Restoration of Christianity in Suakin"
 flavor_eth.37.desc:0 "Although the city submitted to the Mamluks in 1317, many still believed that the city remained a center of Christianity. This changed when more and more Muslim immigrants settled in Suakin. Over time, the last remaining Christians - our brothers and sisters in faith - vanished into the shadows. But these times are now over as Suakin is finally part of a true Christian [Root.GovernmentName] again and many hidden Copts returned to the light of the day!"
 flavor_eth.37.a:0 "Blessed be these souls!"
 flavor_eth.38.t:0 "Adulis, the Great Port of Aksum"
 flavor_eth.38.desc:1 "Walls made out of sandstone and empty, rugged streets decorate the ruins of a city, which used to be the crown jewel of an ancient Empire. For our ancestors, it would have been a saddening view. - until they see what the proud and diligent workers of [Root.GetName] created! Within an amazingly short amount of time, our constructors and builders restored the port city to its former beauty and many of our people are settling in this city!"
 flavor_eth.38.a:0 "And this time, Adulis shall live for far longer!"
 flavor_eth.39.t:0 "Surpassing of the Aksumite Borders"
 flavor_eth.39.desc:1 "Originally, the Aksumite Empire only had the Nubian region, North Ethiopian areas and the southern coast of Arabia. Borders which are no match to ours! [Root.Monarch.GetName] lead our [Root.GovernmentName] to many successful battles and to campaigns of war and now we not only have achieved the restoration but even the surpassing of an empire which fell over 400 years ago!\nWith these massive campaigns of conquest, many of our nobles plead for an official return to the name "Aksumite Empire" in order to show the world our strength of reviving an ancient realm. On the other hand, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisers recommend that we start looking into the future. How shall our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decide?"
 flavor_eth.39.a:0 "We should take the mantle of the Aksumite Empire!"
 flavor_eth.39.b:0 "The advisers are right. We have to make our own footprints on this world!"
 flavor_eth.40.t:0 "The Kingdom Semien"
 flavor_eth.40.desc:2 "Back in the days when the Aksumite Empire ruled over these lands, there was a group of Jews, who refused to follow the true faith. They resisted Ezana's religious declaration and assembled revolts against the rightful emperor. Centuries later, the Jewish queen Gudit levied an army and destroyed the Aksumite Empire for good.\nThis all is long in the past, but the Beta Israeli remained a troublesome group - even for [Root.GetName]. We can try to convert them to [Root.Religion.GetName] though we will face heavy resistence from the Beta Israeli."
 flavor_eth.40.a:1 "Show them the way of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 flavor_eth.40.b:1 "We should not create a bigger rift between our people."
 flavor_eth.41.t:1 "The Journey over the Nile"
 flavor_eth.41.desc:1 "Usually most of our ambassadors travel by foot to Egypt and then take the next best boat to reach Europe. However, sometimes people grow bold and try different ways to reach a destination. Our current ambassador is one of them as he took a few galleys from our mighty fleet and traveled with them over the Nile. Fortunately for the ambassador, the Lord protected him from the danger of the great river and the infidels in the North and guided him to the Mediterranean Sea."
 flavor_eth.41.a:0 "I didn't think he would come so far."
 flavor_eth.42.t:0 "Contact with the Christians!"
 flavor_eth.42.desc:1 "After an additional 50 days of travel, the ambassador reached his goal: contact with the Christians of Europe! Although their views are quite heretical to us, our diplomats are just glad to be in contact with the outside world yet again. Additionally, these 'Catholics' share our ambition for a crusade against the Muslim threat, which makes them potential allies."
 flavor_eth.42.a:0 "God bless this ambassador and our new-found allies!"
 flavor_eth.43.t:0 "A strange Ambassador"
 flavor_eth.43.desc:1 "Our guards found a strange group of three galleys heading directly towards Rome this morning. After the men on the galleys confirmed that they were coming in peace, the interception fleet let them pass. Apparently, these people are fellow Christians and they are guarding a strange ambassador, who claims to have sailed the long way from Ethiopia over the mighty Nile.\nThe ambassador is here to restore the old contact between [From.GetName] and the Roman Empire!"
 flavor_eth.43.a:1 "Ethiopia? One moment... is he a servant of Prester John?!"
 flavor_eth.43.a.tt:0 "Discover all provinces from §Y[From.GetName]§!."
 flavor_eth.44.t:0 "Alliance with the Portuguese?"
 flavor_eth.44.desc:1 "[Root.GetName] had contact with the Portuguese before, but we never desired an alliance with them. But due to the circumstance that heathens are breathing down our neck and that the Catholic Pope is incapable of being helpful, our diplomats figured that it is a good idea to ally with the Portuguese. Our ambassador is only waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s command!"
 flavor_eth.44.a:0 "Sail, my son, and make them our alliance offer!"
 flavor_eth.44.b:0 "On a second thought... [Root.GetName] stands better without them."
 flavor_eth.45.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s Alliance Request"
 flavor_eth.45.desc:1 "A young diplomat from a foreign land reached the court of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and wishes for an audience! Apparently, the man is coming from the ancient land of [From.GetName]. As fellow Christians, he was sent to offer an alliance with us.\nWhile we are too far away from [From.GetName] to receive any beneficial help within Europe, [From.GetName] might still be a useful ally for our ambitions in the Indian Ocean."
 flavor_eth.45.a:0 "We should accept their offer."
 flavor_eth.45.a.at:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will receive access to the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! mercenary company if they get into a war with [ADA.GetName] and if [ADA.GetName] receives aid themselves."
 flavor_eth.45.b:0 "They might be useful, yes, but there are better allies than [From.GetName]."
 flavor_eth.46.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts the Alliance"
 flavor_eth.46.desc:0 "Our diplomat returns! With a glance of excitement in his eyes for achieving his first successful mission, he reports that the Portuguese are accepting the offer and wish to be our ally!"
 flavor_eth.46.a:1 "This is wonderful news!"
 flavor_eth.46.a.at:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! will aid us in our war with [ADA.GetName] should [ADA.GetName] receive foreign aid themselves."
 flavor_eth.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses the ALliance"
 flavor_eth.47.desc:1 "Our diplomat returns! The look of the young man is one of disappointment. He reports that the Portuguese have no interest in an alliance with [Root.GetName] and sent our diplomat packing!"
 flavor_eth.47.a:1 "Don't worry. You gave your best. It's their loss, not ours."
 flavor_eth.48.t:0 "Modernization of an Army"
 flavor_eth.48.desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], our armies were able to modernize. Our troops have fully embraced the westernization of their fighting abilities!\nThey learned the strategies of the French Grande Armée.\nThey endured Prussian training.\nThey received Swiss guns.\nAnd now they are ready to fight for the glory of [Root.GetName]!"
 flavor_eth.48.a:0 "Glory to [Root.GetName]!"
 flavor_eth.49.t:0 "Support of the Ottoman"
 flavor_eth.49.desc:0 "In the great Ethiopian-Adal war in 1529, the Ottoman joined an alliance with the Sultanate Adal in order to defeat the Ethiopian Empire and to extinguish the last Christian bastion in the Horn of Africa. Although it wasn't a full blown war for the Ottomans, they supported Adal with several companies of Turkish soldiers."
 flavor_eth.49.ada.desc:0 "The war between [Root.GetName] and [ETH.GetName] rages on. Neither side seems to be a clear winner and at few fronts the [Root.GetAdjective] troops are even getting pushed back. Fortunately, we have prepared for this day. Turkish elite soldiers from Anatolia arrived in [Root.GetName] to join the fight against the Christian threat!"
 flavor_eth.49.a:0 "Blessed be the Ottomans for their help!"
 flavor_eth.49.a.tt:0 "Enables the §YOttoman Janissaries§! Mercenary Company."
 flavor_eth.50.t:0 "Support of the Portuguese"
 flavor_eth.50.desc:1 "The Ethiopian-Adal war has been a disaster for Ethiopia. Many towns got razed, the capital got sieged down by the combined power of Adal and the Ottoman Empire and the remaining army of Ethiopia had to retreat into the mountains. The Muslims assumed that it was only a matter of time until Ethiopia fell.\nThen the Portuguese arrived. In the year 1541, the Portuguese sent the commander Cristóvão da Gama with a company of Portuguese troops to assist Ethiopia and to fight against the Ottoman Empire. These new troops allowed Ethiopia to turn the tables and to defeat the vastly larger Muslim army, which led to the white peace in 1543."
 flavor_eth.50.a:0 "Thank God the Portuguese have come!"
 flavor_eth.50.a.tt:0 "Enables the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! Mercenary Company."
 flavor_eth.51.t:0 "End of the Portuguese-Ottoman Conflicts"
 flavor_eth.51.desc:1 "The Portuguese and the Ottoman had a long history of rivalry ever since the Ottoman Empire blocked the trade from the Silk Road to Europe. The first real fight, however, started when the Ottoman assisted the Sultanate of Gujarat in the siege of Diu in 1538. Ever since, these two great powers were at war with each other on several occasions with the Ethiopian-Adal war being the most prominent proxy war.\nAfter the small victory of Ethiopia, the Portuguese continued their wins against the Ottoman. In the year 1559, Suleiman the I had to recognize that decisive victories against the Portuguese were a futile project. Because of that, the militaristic activities of these two powers have been greatly reduced in the Horn of Africa."
 flavor_eth.51.a:0 "So be it."
 flavor_eth.51.a.tt:0 "The §YOttoman Janissaries§! and the §YPortuguese Musketeers§! Mercenary Companies are no longer available."
 flavor_eth.52.t:0 "Jesuit Activities in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_eth.52.desc:1 "In the years 1555 and 1557, the first Portuguese Jesuits arrived in Ethiopia. At first they intended to stand for the small Portuguese community, which has been growing in Ethiopia since 1543. However, their influence in the Ethiopian court grew. It went so far that the Catholic church started to become a real threat to the authority of the Coptic church and now they are trying to talk [Root.Monarch.GetName] into converting to Catholicism! How shall we deal with those foreign missionaries?"
 flavor_eth.52.a:0 "We shall banish these parasites!"
 flavor_eth.52.b:0 "They should be warned!"
 flavor_eth.52.c:1 "Maybe they are right. We should convert to Catholicism."

 flavor_mal.9.d:1 "After the death of Mansa Suleyman Keita, the brother of the mighty Mansa Musa, the empire of [Root.GetName] has seen a constant decline in power, influence and wealth over the decades. Civil wars, fights for the thrones and a series of incompetent mansas undermined the stability of [Root.GetName]. Former subjects such as the Songhai or the Timbuktu declared their independence from the empire, and even now the realm is seeing further and further fall in importance."

 flavor_mal.10.d:1 "Like a miracle, the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] survived the internal struggles for power between factions, convinced the subjects to remain loyal to the mansa and even united the royal court. Even better, the old borders of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] have been restored and, as such, the influence the realm once had in West Africa.\nNow it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to expand the power and influence of [Root.GetName] even beyond the achievements the mighty Mansa Musa reached!"

 flavor_kon.7.desc.ib:0 "Strange pale men in silver armor and long, brown robes have been spotted at our coasts. After the initial contact it was clear that these men have come a long way, all the way from what they call 'Iberia'. A short audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName] was organized and these strangers told us their intentions: these 'Portuguese' and 'Castilian' are here to discover the world and to spread the name of the one they call 'Christ'. Their technology is more advanced than what has been ever seen in [Root.GetName] and as such both the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] were intrigued by those strangers."
 flavor_kon.7.desc.pap:0 "A group of elderly men arrived at our coastline. They are all dressed in long, white robes and have funny hats. They claim to be here in the name of their 'Pope' and seek an audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Apparently, these men are bishops from a country called '[PAP.GetName]' and are here to spread the word of 'Christ'. None of us really knows what they are talking about, but their technology seems way ahead of ours, and their beliefs intrigued [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] alike."
 flavor_kon.7.desc.catholic:1 "People in long, brown robes and strange golden crosses arrived at our coastline. They claim to be here to 'bring us to the right path' and sought an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They reveal themselves to be 'missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church'. While none of us really understands what that means, their technology has attracted our interest."
 flavor_kon.7.desc.christian:1 "A small boat stranded at our coastline. When a few of our warriors approached it carefully they found five totally exhausted men in brown robes. Considering their clothes, they looked like they were tried to be burnt alive and barely escaped without serious physical damage. They were brought to [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the discovery of these pale men gained the people's attention. Apparently, these 'missionaries' are persecuted people, who were under the attack of 'Protestant' heretics. They tell us about their technology and their religion and gained the attention of our upper class."
 flavor_kon.7.desc.others:1 "Three men in heavily damaged robes and serious wounds flushed on our shores! A few civilians immediately got to them and took care of their wounds. After a few weeks, the men were able to stand up again and told us their stories of their home - and how it was destroyed by unholy forces. They also tell stories about their religion, 'Catholicism' and how one can simply join them. Their stories about their religion and their technology raised an eyebrow of [Root.Monarch.GetName], but ultimately got [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] interest."

 flavor_zim.1.d:2 "Zimbabwe was once the great capital of the Zimbabwe Empire, which broke apart due to civil wars centuries ago. Ever since, the city serves us as our marvelous capital with its many stone houses.\nBut its days are numbered.

 flavor_zim.2.t:1 "Surpassing Zimbabwe"
 flavor_zim.2.d:2 "The once mighty Zimbabwe dominated the Southern African region and was the middle point of culture and commerce in Southern Africa.

The [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] has reached a height of power, which our ancestors could only have dreamt of. During a day of celebration, the [Root.GetClergyName] met the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and congratulated him on this success. They recommend the renaming of our nation to Great Zimbabwe to honor Mwari and our ancestors."

 flavor_zim.5.desc:1 "[Root.GetName] is an attractive place for merchants from all over the world due to our access to gold and ivory. While it brings great prosperity for us, it also has the side effect of religious conflicts between the merchants. Such are the case with the Christian and the Muslim merchants in [Root.Capital.GetName], who try to compete against each other on the markets and in the royal court.\nIf we want ever peace from this nuisance [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to choose how we should deal with these aggressive merchants."

Now [Root.GetName] has a Christian [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] on the throne!"

 flavor_aju.1.b:0 "Decline the offer."
 flavor_aju.5.t:0 "The Merchants of [From.GetName]"
 flavor_aju.5.d:1 "Merchants from [From.GetName] have become a more common sight in India recently. They are fair traders and the wares they bring are of high quality. What stands out is their engagement in the local production processes and the currency they pay us with. These merchants might come in handy to improve our production of our several goods, but we may become too dependent on these foreigners."
 flavor_aju.5.a:0 "A better production is always good though."
 flavor_aju.5.b:0 "Expel them."
 flavor_aju.6.t:0 "A giraffe for the Son of Heaven"
 flavor_aju.6.d:0 "The distant nation of [From.GetName] has sent ambassadors to our glorious ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They brought us news of their land and sumptuous gifts, one of them caught the eye of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A giraffe, an animal more akin to myth and legend in our country. They presented us the animal as a gift from their [From.Monarch.GetTitle] as a sign of friendship."
 flavor_aju.6.a:0 "It is... It is ... BEAUTIFUL!"
 flavor_aju.6.b:0 "Thanks, but we don't really need giraffes."

 flavor_aju.4.t:0 "Currency minting"
 flavor_aju.4.d:0 "Having access to gold mines, we can better regulate the production and minting of coins, resulting in an increased wealth for our country. Developing a proper and stable minting industry is sure to increase our economic power."

 flavor_aju.7.a:0 "Glad to see him liking it"
 flavor_aju.8.t:0 "They said it was meh..."
 flavor_aju.8.d:0 "The ambassadors we sent to [From.GetName] have returned at last. Apparently, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] was unimpressed by our gift and refused the giraffe we offered. The ambassadors were forced to bring it back with them, but unfortunately the poor animal wasn't able to manage the trip back. We will not soon forget this disrespect."
 flavor_aju.8.a:0 "You are meh too..."
 flavor_aju.9.t:0 "United dynasties"
 flavor_aju.9.d:1 "Our islands have been a colony of [From.GetName] in the past. Eventually, we gained our freedom though as governing the Maldives proved too difficult to govern - until now. [From.GetAdjective] Ambassadors have come to us from the mainland asking to put an end to this situation. Having been ruled by the same family, they argue that it makes no sense to be seen as two different nations, and that we both would benefit if we reunited with our brethren."
 flavor_aju.9.a:0 "Glad to be back"
 flavor_aju.9.b:2 "We will not submit to [From.GetName]!"
 flavor_aju.10.t:0 "United dynasties - they accept!"

 flavor_aju.11.d:1 "The ambassadors we sent to [From.GetName] have returned with dire news! [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has refused our proposal of reuniting our nations. The fool must think [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] better than us. What [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] doesn't realize is that the offer we presented was a mere formality, they are part of our nation whether they like it or not, and we are sure to show them."
 flavor_aju.11.a:0 "Their land belongs to us one way or another!"
 flavor_aju.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] merchants in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_aju.12.d:0 "The merchants sent to us by [From.GetName] are sure to bring us great profit. Being able to trade with such distant lands will bring with it a great influx of wealth and people turning [613.GetName] into a bustling market."

 flavor_aju.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] merchants in Java"

 flavor_aju.13.a:0 "Nice"
 flavor_aju.14.t:0 "Modernization of the army"
 flavor_aju.14.d:0 "Under the Ottoman guidance we could have a modern and imposing army. We could hire some of their instructors to radically change our armies, which wouldn't definitely be cheap but would be effective. Alternatively, we also have the option of buying some of their extra guns, we could get some better equipment but not the expertise to use it, that would be something we should earn by ourselves."
 flavor_aju.14.a:0 "We shall ask for their guidance"
 flavor_aju.14.b:0 "We shall buy new equipment"

 flavor_ada.4.a:0 "Curses!"
 flavor_ada.5.t:0 "No Empire in Anatolia"
 flavor_ada.5.d:0 "Our diplomat returned home. But he looks defeated, in shock even. Apparently, there is no great empire in Anatolia, who is willing to help us. Heathens and heretics conquered Anatolia and the Turks, who were a promising ally, are subjects of a hostile power."

 kon_develop_country_desc:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is on the verge to reach greatness. However, for achieving this we need more people and the infrastructure to support them. We should develop [1170.GetCapitalName] and the surrounding area."
 kon_colonize_coast_title:0 "Nzimbu Sources"
 kon_colonize_coast_desc:0 "Traditionally the shells of clams, the nzimbu, served [Root.GetName] as the currency. They are relatively easy to break, and because access to gold is rare in our home region we need these shells to continue minting the currency.\nFortunately there is a good source for more of these valuable shells: the islands next to the coast of [1167.GetName] are home to the clams. We should expand our territory and integrate this coast to increase our access to the nzimbu."
 kon_protect_trade_title:0 "Controller of Trade"
 kon_protect_trade_desc:0 "The economy of [Root.GetName] is based on nzimbu as currency and the inner trading. But only internal trade is not efficient enough, and as such we should expand trade to the inner tribes of Kongo, the great lake and the Ivory Coast."
 kon_seize_crown_land_title:0 "Seize the Mani Power"
 kon_seize_crown_land_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is a confederacy of provinces, managed by the Mani of our country. They collect the taxes of the rural areas and every year present their earnings to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Should our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] be happy with them then the Mani are able to hold onto their power for another year.\nWhile this system worked out very well in the past, it is a very outdated form of government, and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to survive we need to seize the power of the Mani and centralize the state."

 kon_absolute_rule_desc:1 "The world is changing, and so does our place too. The Europeans have brought new ideas. Not all of them are practical for us, but the concept of absolutism is one worth pursuing. It is in direct conflict with old traditional ways of state government, but our people saw the advancements the Europeans have achieved under this guide line.\nWe should embrace this concept and implement the absolute rulership in our realm too."

However, the fate of this city hangs in the balance when resource scarcity drove the people out of the city and made them move into the several other provinces of our realm.\nIn times like that it is upper most important that we keep our [Root.GovernmentName] as stable as possible."

 zim_restore_the_city_desc:1 "The great city of Zimbabwe was constructed 200 years ago, and as such plays a major role in our history. It houses the many great stone houses of our people, holds many stories of our past and was even described as the golden city in the holy books of foreigners who visited us.\nNow the once great city is nothing but abandoned ruins; a town where not even the spirits of our ancestors would want to remain. We cannot allow this important city to decay into ruin!"

 zim_build_navy_desc:1 "The Zimbabwe Empire used to have a flourishing trade relation with the Asians from the far east. But it was a very one-dimensional trade relation as the merchants had to come to us.\nThis is no longer a valid trade strategy though.
