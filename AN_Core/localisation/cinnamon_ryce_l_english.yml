 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.1.t:0 "Portuguese Envoys in Ayutthaya"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.1.d:0 "Captured in 1511, Malacca came under the control of Portugal, who established it as a their base in South-East Asia. Having learnt that the neighboring Siamese had claimed rights over Malacca, the Portuguese viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, sent three envoys to Ayutthaya in an attempt to establish friendly relations. The third of these envoys, led by Duarte de Coelho, concluded with a treaty signed between Portugal and Siam. In exchange for guns and ammunition, the Siamese guaranteed religious freedoms, and agreed to facilitate the efforts of the Portuguese in establishing local settlements and trade networks. As many as three hundred Portuguese nationals later settled down in Ayutthaya, with many traders and military experts being among them."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.1.a:0 "Honor to our new friends!"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.1.b:0 "The Portuguese have no place in Malacca!"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.2.t:0 "Return of the Uthong Clan"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.2.d:0 "Following King Chairacha's death in 1546, his son, Prince Kaeofa, succeeded him at the age of eleven. His mother, Lady Si Sudachan, stepped up as acting regent. During this time, Si Sudachan was engaged in an adulterous relationship with a government officer known by his noble title of Phanbut Si Thep, who rose to prominence under the new title of Khun Chinnarat. In 1548, the young King Kaeofa was executed at Khok Phraya Temple, and Lady Si Sudachan declared Khun Chinnarat king, styling him King Worawongsa. The two, both being members of the deposed Uthong clan, were met with nationwide opposition from the other noble houses, who despised the immorale and brutal return of Uthong. United under the banner of the Suphannaphum clan, members of the Sukhothai, Suphannaphum, and Si Thammarat clans united against Uthong, and assassinated the usurper and his adulteress, handing over the throne to Prince Thian, who was proclaimed King Maha Chakkraphat."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.2.a:0 "Uthong reigns once more!"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.2.b:0 "Rally the clans, Uthong cannot rule!"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.4.t:0 "The Capture of Malacca"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.4.d:0 "The first Portuguese references to Malacca appeared after Vasco da Gama returned from his expedition to Calicut. The city was described as being a forty day journey away from India, where clove, nutmeg, porcelains and silk were sold in abundance. Supposedly, the city was ruled by a Christian sovereign, who could amass an army of ten thousand men for war, which prompted King Manuel to find the city. A first expedition was launched in 1509, but ultimately failed, resulting in the capture of most of the soldiers at the hands of the Sultan. In 1511, the Viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, launched a second expedition to seize Malacca. In July, following a rejected ultimatum to release all the prisoners from the 1509 expedition, the Sultan strengthened his defenses to prepare for an inevitable invasion. Over the course of two assaults, Albuquerque's men conquered the city, pillaging the households of those not allied to the Portuguese. The Sultan of Malacca tried several times to retake the city, but all attempts failed, leading to the eventual downfall of the Sultanate."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.4.a:0 "Sack the city!"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.4.b:0 "Just demand the return of our men"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.5.t:0 "The Loss of Malacca"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.5.d:0 "Malacca has fallen. As the months have ticked by, we have been exposed to the harsh truth of reality; we have lost Malacca forever. As our hopeless attempts to reclaim the city continue to fail, local rulers have declared their independence, and our nobles fear that without Malacca, we can no longer call ourselves the Malacca Sultanate."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.5.a:0 "These are dark times"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.5.b:0 "We will hold onto our empire!"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.6.t:0 "The Luchuan-Pingmian Campaigns"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.6.d:0 "Starting with the rise of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese influence over the region of Yunnan was always weak. Various bandit factions from the Yun-Gui frontier launched constant raids and incursions into Yunnan, with the large state of Mong Mao being the main source of these attacks. Various military campaigns were launched by the Ming Dynasty to punish Mong Mao for their aggression, but a majority of these punitive campaigns left Mong Mao relatively intact, with Ming suffering heavy casualties."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.6.a:0 "Their banditry ends now!"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.6.b:0 "We cannot afford any more casualties"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.7.t:0 "The Fall of Mong Mao"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.7.d:0 "In our attempt to find and execute [MMA.Monarch.GetName] of Mong Mao, our troops have captured Mong Mao's capital. Our search for the Mong Mao [MMA.Monarch.GetTitle] however has been unsuccessful, and it is believed that [MMA.Monarch.GetName] has fled the city. Now that they have capitulated, we could cut them down to size, our alternatively, we could continue the war to capture [MMA.Monarch.GetName]."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.7.a:0 "We stand triumphant!"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.7.b:0 "We are not finished with this war!"
 
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.8.t:0 "Shaykh Said's Offer"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.8.d:0 "Recently, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has fallen ill with a terrible disease, and as a result of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sickness, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s skin has begun to crack all over. So far, nobody has managed to treat [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] disease, but a Muslim merchant by the name of Shaykh Said has taken on the challenge of healing [Root.Monarch.GetName], on the condition that if [Root.Monarch.GetName] recovers, both the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court convert to Islam."
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.8.a:0 "We accept his offer"
 BtPLegacyCRsSEAFlavour.8.b:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would rather die!"

 maj_civil_war.1.d:0 "Ever since the Paregreg War, the Majapahit Empire was always in constant decline.
