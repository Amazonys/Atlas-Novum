He justifies this by claiming that restoring the hereditary succession would make it harder to restore the former kings of France to power - after all, there have been several royalist plots on his life - but there is little doubt that his prime motivation is to further his own ambitions for supreme power. The proposal has met with widespread support among the populace, who yearn for the relative stability of the pre-revolutionary years; however, diehard supporters of the Revolution express worry at this attempt to concentrate even more power in Napoléon's hands."

 canal_events.EVTDESC11:0 "It seems that the privately owned canal company that was set up a few years ago has gone bankrupt. They apparently faced severe economic problems early on, but hid this information from the public and deceived investors into sinking more and more money into the project.
