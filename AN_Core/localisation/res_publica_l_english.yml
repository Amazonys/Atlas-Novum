The people fought hard, and while some may feel pride in the scars our republic will carry from this struggle, more have been reminded of the brutality of warfare. The Statists see a chance to seek support for their cause among those who share these sentiments, arguing that a True Republic need not go to war and has no wish to. This could alleviate concerns people have about the future, but that future would likely belong to the Statists."

 dutch_republic.26.d:0 "[Root.GetName] has been a key point for merchants and international trade for as long as anyone can remember, but the key to this success has been a point of contention. Recently, an economic theorist from the area has argued, in his work 'Interest of [Root.GetName] and the motives for its prosperity', that the republican government form is part of the reason the province has thrived, suggesting that with the right political environment, this good fortune could spread throughout [Root.Owner.GetName]."

 dutch_republic.27.d:2 "Some in our nation's frontier provinces look across the border with pride or ambitions of conquest. Others with fear.

 dutch_republic.29.d:1 "Having to share a border with a nation we have declared open rivalry and hostility against could lead people to be contemptuous, but the good citizens of [Root.GetCapitalName] have managed to hide their contempt well.\n\nInstead, the local nobles have secretly started to draft plans of expansion into the lands of our enemy, plans that they believe might be put into action if [Root.Owner.GetName] would only have a leader who thought of the nation's glory first and political games second. They have little respect for the efforts of republicans, but believe that the Prince might support their ambitions."

Nevertheless, at this stage, the only thing that's certain is that the nobles in [Root.GetName] have an aversion to these ill-mannered new rich and would like to see them ousted from local political proceedings."

He names other nobles who are equally concerned... so many, in fact, that his own side seems more like a conspiracy than the ones he accuses. Even so, there is no doubt that the aristocrats of [Root.GetName] feel threatened by these possible secret societies the guilds have brought into existence."

Such a situation has arisen in [Root.GetName], where a local aristocrat claims that land just across our border is in fact part of his family's rightful demesne.\n\nLocal merchants have petitioned against this claim, having just negotiated a major trade deal with the neighboring nation. For a republic, they argue, trade should be the first concern - the claims of nobles lead only to war and misery."

They accept that they cannot claim it as their right, as they could in many other nations. There are times when these old ideas of aristocratic glory reawaken, however, as the nobles of [Root.GetName] feel like they cannot impact its politics in any relevant way but by the sword.

Relying on a large number of apprentices, small shop owners and craftsmen, this faction has been able to confiscate all power within the government, and to monopolize all offices in the administration.\n\nRather than risk lasting marginalization the Aristocrats and Traders have begun to speculate in grain. This has quickly drained the state reserves of bread and grain and lead to a severe increase in prices. Until now, the Guilds have disregarded the developing crisis, as poor people requesting loans to buy food seemed to be an opportunity for tidy profits. That is until they began to crowd the Main Plaza of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], at the foot of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, going as far as slaughtering half a score guards that had ordered them to disperse.\n\nWorst of all, they have begun to loot dozens shops!"

Never has [Root.GetName] been so flourishing, and the gold is pouring in as never before.\n\nYes, who? Squires, maybe, seeing their houses threatened with ruin as their estates are bought by the men in power? Presumably the Guilds also, as Traders favor profits on import more than protection of the home-made products. Maybe commoners also, growing tired of price increases on market stalls and of seeing rents double, for the greater benefit of Traders always eager to increase their wealth…\n\nIn the morning, upset crowds gather at the gates of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, ready to batter them down."

As the authorities intervene, however, the one who stands accused of this crime is someone else entirely, coincidentally the son of a master weaver who is also a prominent spokesman for the Guilds.\n\nNext morning, Guilds and Traders have begun distributing bread and weapons to the commoners; the upset crowds rally around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, and a first charge by the urban militia has caused great loss of blood and lives, before the mob could violently avenge itself.
