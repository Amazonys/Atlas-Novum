 byz_the_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"
 byz_the_silk_road_desc:0 "Centuries have passed since Byzantium controlled the sea of Marmara and thus the Silk Road. While this was a long time ago, we believe that if we can undo the Turkish conquests that has dominated the past century, restore our rule to the lands and by extent control the trade around Constantinople, then maybe we can regain our position as the stopping point on the trade routes between Europe and Asia, even in an age where Europeans attempt to find new ways to India."
 byz_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 byz_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "Mare Nostrum, Latin for \"our sea\", or Mare Internum, \"the inner sea\", was the name of the Mediterranean coined back when the Empire surrounded the sea. As we fulfil our Imperial ambitions in restoring the borders and reclaim our lands, we should also strive to make the sea ours once more by controlling the trade all over the Mediterranean."
 byz_gather_alliances_title:0 "Gather Alliances"
 byz_gather_alliances_desc:0 "Our situation is a perilous one indeed. With the Turk standing on our doorstep, many of our brethren do naught but pray for a miracle. In these times, we need to look outwards, for there is no way we can stand alone in these times: We need a light, a beacon, in these dark times, one that can help us survive the Turkish onslaught that is to come. Let us therefore send our diplomats far and gather allies. We will need them now that end is nigh."
 byz_northern_chersonese_title:0 "The Northern Chersonese"
 byz_northern_chersonese_desc:0 "With the help of our allies we have survived the Turkish onslaught and retaken the Imperial co-capital of Thessalonica. But there is no time to rest or feel safe, for enemies are lurking at our every flank. While we have gained momentary allies of different faiths, there is no doubt that we need to find a strong ally among our brethren. There just so happens that during the times of the Kievan Rus, our envoys Christianized the Slavic savages, pulling them closer to us. It would prove that in our absence, these Slavic peoples have now pushed back the Turkic Tatars up north and are establishing a new Empire of the Rus. It would prove vital that we send our envoys to the North in an attempt to establish long-lasting ties, providing us with an ally that shares our struggles, and that in the end can stand with us as the last bastions of Orthodoxy in the world."
 byz_unite_orthodox_churches_title:0 "Unite Orthodoxy"
 byz_unite_orthodox_churches_desc:0 "Ever since our power has waned in our home region, our northern brethren have fallen out of our sphere of influence.

Alas, it has deteriorated to a state not at all acceptable - We need to direct great efforts towards restoring the city immediately!"
 byz_restore_imperial_co_capital_title:0 "The Imperial Co-Capital"
 byz_restore_imperial_co_capital_desc:0 "There is no doubt that while the City of Constantine is our capital and the definition of our Empire, the very important city of Thessalonica has suffered much during the Turkish onslaughts. It is no more than right that, in our attempts at restoring our glorious capital, we delegate some time towards improving the city that has long been considered the Co-Capital of the Empire."
 byz_restore_imperial_army_title:0 "The Imperial Army"
 byz_restore_imperial_army_desc:0 "The Empire has ever since its founding relied on a powerful army to protect its lands, subjugate neighbors and pacify revolts.

 byz_east_oriental_schism_desc:0 "The Orthodox church used to be united, but as early as the 450s, the Patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria seceded in a schism that separated the Orthodox faith into Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy. Now following their seats in Armenia, the Levant and Egypt, if we bring them back in our fold there is still hope for unification, letting us declare the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople to be the true leader of the Church."

Adrianople fell in 1359 and Thessalonica in 1387, although the latter was regained momentarily twice.

The strait of Gallipoli that once was wrestled from us after the dastardly earthquake needs to be retaken as well, to secure our newly regained holdings.

Centuries of rule by Turks have lead to the region becoming desolate and what people still remain have either immigrated from the Eastern Steppes or have embraced the language and culture of their conquerors. The lands of Anatolia have seen much and it'll take a lot of work to get them back to where they were in the glory times, but in order to even begin our restoration, we need to decide what to do with the Turkic part of our populace - do we accept it and allow them to serve in our armies as true Romans like we did with the Armenians, or do we demand that they embrace Greek or be persecuted?"

 byz_question_of_schismatics_desc:0 "With the Council of Florence culminating in the conversion of John VIII and the rest of the Palaiologos except Demetrios, the religious question of the Empire is a difficult one - what John VIII and the now dead Patriarch Joseph II did was not something that the [Root.GetAdjective] monks would abide to, not only due to the separation of power in the Orthodox Church, but also due to principles. This created a divide of unionists and anti-unionists which up until this point has not been solved and causes great turmoil among our populace.

 byz_no_latins_in_greece_desc:0 "The current state of Greece is disastrous - While we hold the despotate of Morea, every other part of Greece is currently held by either the heathen Turk, or despicable Latins. Not even the Despotate of Epirus can claim any of its heritage, now being ruled by the Latin Tocco. While we have managed to exact tribute over the lord of Athens and secured the loyalty of the Gattilusi in Lesbos through intermarriage, they are very autonomous. While beating back the Turk from Greece is a very difficult task we believe it just as necessary to rid these lands from current Latin influence, lest we risk the loss of Constantinople; not to the Turks, but to them."
