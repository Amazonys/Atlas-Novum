 byz_events.1.t: "The Palaiologan Renaissance"
 byz_events.1.d: "During the reign of the Palaiologos Dynasty, the Byzantines began rediscovering classical art and literature from the remnants of Ancient Greece and Rome. If it were not for the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453, The Byzantine Empire would have been the birthplace of the Renaissance."
 byz_events.1.a: "Let the Renaissance flourish in Constantinople!"
 byz_events.2.t: "Ioannes VIII Palaiologos"
 byz_events.2.d: "Ioannes VIII Palaiologos was the eldest son of Manuel II Palaiologos and Helena Dragaš, the daughter of the Serbian prince Constantine Dragaš. He was associated as co-emperor with his father before 1416 and became sole emperor in 1425. In June 1422, Ioannes VIII Palaiologos supervised the defense of Constantinople during a siege by Murad II, but had to accept the loss of Thessalonica, which his brother Andronikos had given to Venice in 1423. To secure protection against the Ottomans, he visited Pope Eugene IV and consented to the union of the Greek and Roman churches. The Union was ratified at the Council of Florence in 1439, which Ioannes attended with 700 followers including Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople and George Gemistos Plethon, a Neoplatonist philosopher influential among the academics of Italy. The Union failed due to opposition in Constantinople, but through his prudent conduct towards the Ottoman Empire he succeeded in holding possession of the city. Ioannes VIII Palaiologos named his brother Konstantinos XI, who had served as regent in Constantinople in 1437–1439, as his successor. Despite the machinations of his younger brother Demetrios Palaiologos his mother Helena was able to secure Constantine XI's succession in 1448. Ioannes VIII died at Constantinople in 1448."

 byz_events.3.t: "Konstantinos XI Palaiologos"
 byz_events.3.d: "Konstantinos XI Dragases Palaiologos, 8 February 1405 – 29 May 1453, was the last reigning Byzantine Emperor, reigning as a member of the Palaiologos dynasty from 1449 to his death in battle at the fall of Constantinople. Following his death, he became a legendary figure in Greek folklore as the "Marble Emperor" who would awaken and recover the Empire and Constantinople from the Ottomans. His death marked the end of the Roman Empire, which had continued in the East for 977 years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire."

 byz_events.4.t: "Vassal State of the Ottomans"
 byz_events.4.d: "The Ottoman Turks vastly outnumber and overpower the Byzantine army. In order to ensure the continuation of the Empire, the Palaiologos dynasty conceded the Byzantine Empire as a vassal state to the Ottomans. However, this will only hold the Ottomans back for some time. Eventually their lust for conquest will turn towards Constantinople. Byzantium must appeal to the Christian nations of Europe for help."

 byz_events.8.t: "Orban's Cannons"
 byz_events.8.d: "Orban was an iron founder and engineer from Brasso, Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was very skilled at making supercannons, a new military technology that would change siege warfare forever. In 1452 he came to the court of Konstantinos XI and offered his services to the Emperor. However, the Emperor could not afford his high salary, so Orban instead approached the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who employed him and his guns and used them to break the blast the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople in 1453."

 byz_events.10.t: "Giovanni Giustiniani"
 byz_events.10.d: "Giovanni Giustiniani Longo was a young Genoese captain, a member of one of the greatest families of the Republic, a kinsman to the powerful house of Doria in Genoa, and protostrator of the Eastern Roman Empire. He led 700 professional soldiers, both Genovese and Greeks from the island of Chios, which at the time was part of the Republic of Genoa, to the defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman army of Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. He personally financed, organized and led this expedition on his own initiative, and upon arriving was placed in command of the land defenses by Emperor Konstantinos XI Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire. Giustiniani was key in controlling the land forces and keeping the Greeks, Genoese and Venetians from arguing with each other, and instead kept focused on repairing the land walls after the Ottoman cannon had shot holes in them. It was at least partly because of Giustiniani's charisma that the Byzantine forces were able to hold out so long against overwhelming odds. On May 29, 1453, during the final attack by Mehmet II, Giustiniani was wounded by an Ottoman cannon while defending the walls of Constantinople. Some sources say the wound was caused by a crossbow bolt. Sources disagree about whether the wound was to his arm, leg, or chest, but it forced him to withdraw from his station at the land wall. He exited through the locked gate into the city, which opened up the opportunity for the fearful to flee, and panic spread throughout the lines. Seeing the demoralization caused among the defenders by Giustiniani's retreat, Sultan Mehmed II ordered a renewed assault that eventually defeated the Byzantines and Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Although Giustiniani's men managed to escape with their general after its fall, Giustiniani died from his wounds in the 1st of June 1453."

 byz_events.10.b: "We have no need for Latins."
 byz_events.11.t: "Theodosian Walls"
 byz_events.11.d: "For a thousand years these walls have held off invaders threatening the Roman Empire. The Theodosian Walls were without a doubt among the most important defensive systems of Late Antiquity. Indeed, they were perhaps the most successful and influential city walls ever built – they allowed the city and its emperors to survive and thrive for more than a millennium, against all strategic logic, on the edge of an extremely unstable and dangerous world... With the advent of siege cannons, however, the fortifications became obsolete, but their massive size still provided effective defense, as demonstrated during the Second Ottoman Siege in 1422. In the final siege, which led to the fall of the city to the Ottomans in 1453, the defenders, severely outnumbered, still managed to repeatedly counter Turkish attempts at undermining the walls, repulse several frontal attacks, and restore the damage from the siege cannons for almost two months. Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general Giovanni Giustiniani was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken. After the capture of the city, Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects, and they were kept in repair during the first centuries of Ottoman rule. \n Even so, the walls at this point are no longer practical and remain only for ceremonial purposes."

 byz_events.15.a: "The phoenix rises."
 byz_events.16.t: "Demetrios III Palaiologos"
 byz_events.16.d: "Demetrios Palaiologos was born in ca. 1407 as the fifth son of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (reigned 1391–1425) and his wife Helena Dragaš. As a younger son Demetrios was not expected to rule, but was granted the court title of despot in accordance with standard practice. His ambition apparently led to conflict in the imperial family. Although he then received possession of the island of Lemnos from his father Emperor Manuel II in 1422, he refused to live there and fled to the court of King Sigismund of Hungary in 1423, requesting protection against his brothers. He returned to Constantinople by 1427.[1] In November 1437 he accompanied his brother John VIII to the Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence, which sought to reunite the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, although he was a declared enemy of the Union. He returned to Constantinople in January 1440, via Venice.[1] Forced to surrender Lemnos as penalty for returning home without the Emperor's consent, Demetrios was compensated with a more distant appanage at Mesembria on the Black Sea in 1441. On 23 April 1442 he launched an attack on Constantinople with the support of the Ottomans, but it failed, and Demetrios was briefly imprisoned.[1] The appanage of Selymbria, which he had sought, was turned over first to Constantine Palaiologos and then to Theodore II Palaiologos. On 31 October 1448 John VIII died, while his designated heir Constantine was in the Morea. Exploiting his location nearer Constantinople, Demetrios tried to stage a coup d'état and secure the throne for himself. His attempt failed, mostly due to the intervention of their mother, Helena Dragaš. In 1449, the new emperor, Constantine XI, gave Demetrios half of the Morea in order to remove him from the vicinity of Constantinople. He remained co-ruler of the Morea along with his brother Thomas Palaiologos until he surrendered Mistras to the Ottomans in 1460. He was given lands in Thrace as an appanage by Sultan Mehmed II, which he ruled until his disgrace in 1467. Shortly after he was allowed to retire to Adrianople with his wife. He became a monk with the monastic name David after the death of his daughter Helena Palaiologina in 1469, and died in 1470."
 byz_events.16.a: "Demetrios III Palaiologos, in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans"
 byz_events.17.t: "Thomas I Palaiologos"
 byz_events.17.d: "Thomas Palaiologos was the youngest surviving son of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. As youngest son, Thomas was never expected to reign, but his children became the only surviving heirs of the defunct Palaiologan dynasty. Like other imperial sons, Thomas Palaiologos was made a Despot (despotes), and from 1428 joined his brothers Theodore and Constantine in the Morea. After the retirement of Theodore during 1443, he governed together with Constantine, until the latter became emperor (as Constantine XI) during 1448. Thomas remained Despot of the Morea, but was forced to share the rule with his older brother Demetrios beginning 1449. The Byzantine possessions in Morea had expanded considerably at the expense of the Latin Principality of Achaea. After the last war during 1430 virtually the entire peninsula was ruled by the Byzantines, and Thomas married Catherine Zaccaria, the daughter of the last Prince of Achaea Centurione II Zaccaria, succeeding to his father-in-law's possessions during 1432. After this period of success, the fortunes of Byzantine Morea decreased, as the collegiate government by several brothers caused increasing confusion. This became especially serious after the arrival of Demetrios, who had a pro-Ottoman policy as opposed to Thomas' pro-western orientation. From 1447 the Despots had become vassals of the Ottoman Sultan. At the beginning of the siege of Constantinople by Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, an Ottoman army was sent with orders to raid in the Morea, preventing help from being sent to The City. After the conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed II on 29 May 1453, to maintain the status quo, the Sultan ordered the two brothers to continue as joint rulers of Morea until the Ottoman conquest in 1460. After the conquest of Morea, Thomas lived in Rome, recognized throughout Christian Europe as the rightful Emperor of the East. To create greater support for his situation Thomas changed his religion to Roman Catholicism during his last years of life. After his death in 1465, the position of rightful Byzantine emperor was inherited by his older son Andreas Palaiologos, born in Mistra around 1453."
 byz_events.17.a: "Thomas I Palaiologos, in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans"
 byz_events.18.t: "Andreas I Palaiologos"
 byz_events.18.d: "Andreas was the son of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of Morea, and Catherine Zaccaria, the daughter of Centurione II Zaccaria the last Prince of Achaea.[1] After his uncle Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Emperor of Constantinople died defending the capital of the Byzantine Empire on May 29, 1453, Andreas' family continued to live in Morea as vassals of the Turkish Sultan Mehmet II. But constant bickering between Thomas Palaiologos and his brother Demetrios led to the Sultan invading the Morea in 1460; Andreas and his father escaped to Corfu.[2] His father Thomas then left the rest of the family to go to Rome, where he made a ceremonial entrance as Byzantine Emperor 7 March 1461. Andreas' mother died in August 1462, but he and his younger brother Manuel did not rejoin his father until a few days before the man died in 1465. After his father's death, Andreas stayed in the Papal States by consent of the Pope. He lived in Rome, styling himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"). Andreas was considered by his contemporaries, most prominently the Cardinal Bessarion the rightful heir to the Roman (Byzantine) throne who, curiously, lived in Rome years after the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite the great expectations Papal officials had for Andreas, his behavior was not imperial. In 1480 he married Caterina, a woman Runciman describes as "a lady from the streets of Rome"; and he constantly lived beyond his means.[5] During his lifetime, Andreas was believed to have wasted enormous sums of money given to him by the Pope; however, modern historians now believe that the money received from the Pope was only enough for a meager style of life. Desperate for money, Andreas sold the rights to the Byzantine crown which he possessed since the death of his father. Andreas died a pauper during 1502, in spite of having sold his titles and royal and imperial rights again to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile."
 byz_events.18.a: "Andreas I Palaiologos, in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans"
 byz_events.19.t: "Manuel III Palaiologos"
 byz_events.19.d: "Manuel Palaiologos (or Palaeologus) (1455–1512) was the youngest child of Thomas Palaiologos and Catherine Zaccaria. He was brother of the de jure Byzantine Emperor Andrew Palaiologos, Zoe Palaiologina, Grand Duchess of Moscovy, and Helena Palaiologina, wife of Despot Lazar Brankovic of Serbia. Born after the Fall of Constantinople (May 29, 1453), Manuel spent his first few years living in the Morea (modern Peloponnese) till fleeing with his family in 1460 to Corfu. His father Thomas then left the rest of the family to go to Rome, where he made a ceremonial entrance as Byzantine Emperor 7 March 1461. Manuel's mother died in August 1462, but he and his older brother Andrew did not rejoin his father until a few days before the man died in 1465. For the next few years he and his brother were brought up under the watchful eye of Cardinal Bessarion. Pope Pius II granted him a pension of 50 ducats a month, but this came to an end with the prelate's death in 1465; his successor Pope Sixtus IV proved to be not as generous. After several years of life as an exile, Manuel surprised the Roman establishment by returning to Constantinople and throwing himself on the mercy of the Sultan Mehmed II. In exchange for his rights to the Imperial throne, the Sultan granted him an estate and a comfortable pension. He married a woman, whose name has not been recorded, and by whom he had two sons: John (Ioannes), who died at an early age; and Andrew (Andreas), who converted to Islam. Although Runciman identifies Andrew with a court official named Mehmet Pasha, subsequent research has shown they are two different men. Manuel died in 1512."
 byz_events.19.a: "Manuel III Palaiologos, in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans"
 byz_events.20.t: "The Fall of Constantinople"
 byz_events.20.d: "The Fall of Constantinople was the capture of the capital of the Greco-Roman Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. The capture of Constantinople (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Roman Empire, an imperial state that had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.[33] The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to Christendom, as the Islamic Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear. After the conquest, Sultan Mehmed II transferred the capital of the Ottoman Empire from Edirne to Constantinople. Several Greek and other intellectuals fled the city before and after the siege, with the majority of them migrating particularly to Italy, which helped fuel the Renaissance. The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire[34] was a key event in the Late Middle Ages, which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Middle Ages."
 byz_events.20.a: "Here ends the Roman Empire"
 byz_events.21.t: "The Great Schism"
 byz_events.21.d: "Ever since the the Schism of 1054, the Christian faith has been divided by East and West. The Eastern Orthodox church of the Byzantine Empire has especially hated the Catholic Latins ever since the atrocities committed during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 and the installation of the Latin Empire. However, now there is a greater problem: The Muslim Ottoman Turks have entered Europe and threaten the very existence of what remains of the Roman Empire. The Palaiologan has looked towards the West for help against the heathens, and have even converted to Catholicism to garner support. Ioannes VIII even secured a Union of the Churches at the Council of Florence, but opposition in the Byzantine Empire kept it from having any real power. If the Basileus had all the authority in the church, he may able to sway the people to convert to Catholicism, and hopefully gain more support in the West to kick out the Turks."
 byz_events.21.a: "The scars of the Latin Empire still lay in the minds of the Byzantines."
 byz_events.22.t: "The Knights of Rhodes"
 byz_events.22.d: "Now that the Byzantine Empire is Catholic, more efforts are being made to restore the Empire to its former glory. To ensure the restoration of the Empire, the Pope has ordered the Order of the Knights of St. John to fight under the banner of the Ottomans, granted the Byzantines respect their independence."
 byz_events.22.a: "Let us march on a new crusade!"
 byz_events.23.t: "Reconstruction of the Great Palace of Constantinople"
 byz_events.23.d: "The Great Palace of Constantinople — also known as the Sacred Palace — was the large Imperial Byzantine palace complex located in the south-eastern end of the city.  It served as the main royal residence of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine emperors from 330 to 1081 and was the center of imperial administration for over 800 years. It had fallen into disrepair by the time of Constantine VII, who ordered its renovation. From the early 11th century onwards the Byzantine emperors favored the Palace of Blachernae as an imperial residence, though they continued to use the Great Palace as the primary administrative and ceremonial center of the city. It declined substantially during the following century when parts of the complex were demolished or filled with rubble. During the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, the Palace was plundered by the soldiers of Boniface of Montferrat. Although the subsequent Latin emperors continued to use the Palace complex, they lacked money for its maintenance. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went as far as removing the lead roofs of the Palace and selling them. Consequently, when the city was retaken by the forces of Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261, the Great Palace was in disrepair. The Palaiologos emperors largely abandoned it, ruling from Blachernae and using the vaults as a prison. In order to show the world the resurgence of the Empire, it is time that we reconstruct the Great Palace where Justinian once resided."

 byz_events.23.b: "This is just a big waste of ducats."
 byz_events.24.t: "Renovation of the Hagia Sophia"
 byz_events.24.d: "The current building was originally constructed as a church between 532 and 537 on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I and was the third Church of the Holy Wisdom to occupy the site, the previous two having both been destroyed by rioters. It was designed by the Greek geometers Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. The church was dedicated to the Wisdom of God, the Logos, the second person of the Holy Trinity, its patronal feast taking place on 25 December, the commemoration of the birth of the incarnation of the Logos in Christ. Although sometimes referred to as Sancta Sophia (as though it were named after Saint Sophia), sophia being the phonetic spelling in Latin of the Greek word for wisdom, its full name in Greek is Naos tes Hagias tou Theou Sophias, "Shrine of the Holy Wisdom of God". The church contained a large collection of holy relics and featured, among other things, a 15-meter (49 ft) silver iconostasis. The focal point of the Eastern Orthodox Church for nearly one thousand years, the building witnessed the excommunication of Patriarch Michael I Cerularius on the part of Humbert of Silva Candida, the papal envoy of Pope Leo IX in 1054, an act which is commonly considered the start of the Great Schism. Now, the basilica has fallen under disrepair. In order to show the world the strength of the Orthodox Church, it is time that we renovate this great icon of Constantinople."

 byz_events.26.t: "Byzantine Silk"
 byz_events.26.d: "The Byzantine capital of Constantinople was the first significant silk-weaving center in Europe. Silk was one of the most important commodities in the Byzantine economy, used by the state both as a means of payment and of diplomacy.[1] Raw silk was bought from China and made up into fine fabrics that commanded high prices throughout the world. Later, silkworms were smuggled into the Empire and the overland silk trade gradually became less important. After the reign of Justinian I, the manufacture and sale of silk became an imperial monopoly, only processed in imperial factories, and sold to authorized buyers. Byzantine silks are significant for their brilliant colors, use of gold thread, and intricate designs that approach the pictorial complexity of embroidery in loom-woven fabric. Byzantium dominated silk production in Europe throughout the Early Middle Ages, until the establishment of the Italian silk-weaving industry in the 12th century and the conquest and break-up of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade (1204)."
 byz_events.26.a: "Our silk is a symbol of prestige and wealth!"
 byz_events.27.t: "Loukas Notaras"
 byz_events.27.d: "Loukas Notaras (5 April 1402 - 3 June 1453) was the last Megas Doux of the Byzantine Empire. This position (literally Grand Duke, but more appropriately Lord High Admiral) had been expanded under the late Palaiologid emperors and functioned as an unofficial Prime Minister, overseeing the Imperial Bureaucracy in place of the Megas Logothetes who had previously exercised this function. In 1424, Notaras was one of three emissaries—along with Manuel Melachrenos and George Sphrantzes—who negotiated a treaty of friendship between Emperor John VII Palaiologos and Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Turks at the end of the Ottoman Interregnum. His continued importance as an imperial official is attested by his presence at the marriage of the future Emperor Constantine Palaiologos to Caterina Gattilusio 27 July 1441. During the siege of Constantinople, Notaras led the troops along the north-western Sea Wall. Some accounts of the siege have him deserting his post after the Ottoman banner was raised on the tower above the Kerkoporta; again, however, this may have been politically motivated slander. In any case, he was able to hold the Sea Wall—which had been the point of entry of all earlier successful attacks on the city—against the Turkish fleet until the breach along the Mesotechion rendered his efforts moot. Notaras, his Palaiologina wife and his son were all captured by the Turks and originally granted clemency in the name of reestablishing order and in exchange for much of Notaras's fortune, which he had had the sense to invest abroad in Venice in the form of dowries for his children. Nonetheless, he was executed shortly after along with his son and son-in-law."

 byz_events.28.d: "Sehzade Orhan, (b.1412- d.29 May 1453), was sent as a hostage to Constantinople together with his sister Fatma. Whether in Constantinople by Constantine XI, supervised and funded by Mehmed II, Prince Orhan, who described himself as a contender for the throne of the sultan Bayezid I, was actually a grandson, and thus belonged to the generation of Mehmed II uncle, is unclear. When Mehmed II succeeded the Ottoman throne, Constantine responded by threatening to release Prince Orhan, who was a contender to the Ottoman throne, unless Mehmed met some of his demands. He committed suicide after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, suicide or was taken on the run and executed on behalf of Mehmed II."

All sea trade to the Mediterranean must flow through here and the Sea of Marmara. The Italian Trade Republics have taken advantage of the geopolitical conflict of the region since the 1200s and have established trade superiority in the region.

 byz_events.40.t: "Gregorios Gemistos Plethon"
 byz_events.40.d: "Georgius Gemistus, later called Plethon, was a Greek scholar of Neoplatonic philosophy. He was one of the chief pioneers of the revival of Greek learning in Western Europe. In Mistra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included Basilios Bessarion and George Scholarius (later to become Patriarch of Constantinople and Plethon's enemy). He was made chief magistrate by Theodore II. In 1415 and 1418 he wrote pamphlets to Theodore and Manuel describing how the Empire could be reorganized according to Plato's Republic, with political, legal and economic reforms, and gained even greater reputation as a legal thinker, with rumors that he carried entire legal codes in his memory. In 1428 Gemistos was consulted by Emperor Ioannes VIII on the issue of unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power. He re-introduced Plato's thoughts to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 Council of Florence, a failed attempt to reconcile the East-West schism. Here Pletho met and influenced Cosimo de' Medici to found a new Platonic Academy, which, under Marsilio Ficino, would proceed to translate into Latin all Plato's works, the Enneads of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works. After his return to the Peloponnese, Gemistos founded a school. He taught polytheism as opposed to monotheism, and some of his students prayed to statues of the pagan deities. He died in 1454."

 byz_events.46.t: "The Hexamilion Wall"
 byz_events.46.d: "The Hexamilion wall is a defensive wall constructed across the Isthmus of Corinth guarding the only land route into the Peloponnese peninsula from mainland Greece. The wall was constructed in the period between 408 AD and 450 AD, in the reign of Theodosius II during the time of the great Barbarian invasions into the Roman Empire. The attack of Alaric on Greece in 396 AD or the sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths may have motivated the construction, which included towers, sea bastions, and at minimum one fortress. The one known fortress contained two gates (north and south), of which the northern gate functioned as the formal entrance to the Peloponessos. The wall was constructed with a rubble and mortar core faced with squared stones. It is not certain how long it took to complete, but the importance given to the task is apparent from the scale of the construction; the Hexamilion is the largest archaeological structure in Greece. Every structure in the region was cannibalized for stone for the effort, either being incorporated into the wall directly, as was the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia, or being burned into lime, as was the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora as well as much of the ancient statuary of Corinth. In the reign of Justinian, the wall was fortified with additional towers, reaching a total number of 153. Military use appears to have fallen off after the 7th century AD, and by the 11th AD domestic structures were being built into the wall. In 1415, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II personally supervised repairs over a period of forty days. The high cost of this effort caused unrest among the local elite. The wall was breached in 1423 and again in 1431 by the Ottomans under the command of Turahan Bey. Despot Constantine Palaiologos restored the wall again in 1444, but the Turks breached it again in 1446 and in October 1452. After the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese in 1460, the wall was abandoned. During its history, the wall never succeeded in fulfilling the function for which it was constructed, unless it acted as a deterrent. Elements of the wall are preserved south of the Corinth Canal and at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia."

 byz_events.47.t: "Helena Palaiologina, Queen Consort of Cyprus"
 byz_events.47.d: "Helena Palaiologina (3 February 1428 – 11 April 1458) was a Byzantine princess of the Palaiologos family, who became the Queen consort of Cyprus and Armenia, titular Queen consort of Jerusalem, and Princess of Antioch through her marriage to King John II of Cyprus and Armenia. She was the mother of Queen Charlotte of Cyprus. Helena was largely responsible for the revival of Greek influence in Cyprus due to the numerous members of the Byzantine court who arrived in her wake and were given positions at the Lusignan court. This led to a renewal of ties with the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, she welcomed and gave assistance to many Byzantine refugees who had fled to Cyprus. She was described as having been "stronger in character than her husband". She took charge of the kingdom, and her policies in favor of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture enraged the Franks who looked upon her as a dangerous enemy; however she had become far too powerful for them to attack.  Pope Pius II also condemned her for supporting the Orthodox Church, and her endowment of 15,000 ducats per annum to the monastery of Saint George of Mangana also drew much criticism as it was considered to have been "extravagant generosity in impoverished times". The Greek Cypriots, on the other hand, had always revered Helena as a great heroine due to her bold, decisive character in looking after their interests. In 1457, she poisoned her son-in-law, Infante John of Portugal, who had given his support to the Catholic party, thus incurring her wrath and enmity; also she wished for her daughter to marry Louis of Savoy. This second marriage Helena did arrange for her daughter, Charlotte; however, the marriage between Charlotte and Louis took place in 1459, when Helena and King John were both dead, and Charlotte by that time had succeeded her father as Queen Regnant of Cyprus. Helena died on 11 April 1458 in the fortress of Nicosia where she and King John had barricaded themselves during the insurrection of his illegitimate son, James. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic's. John died the same year, and was succeeded by his only surviving legitimate child, Charlotte."

 byz_events.48.t: "Royal Marriage with Georgia"
 byz_events.48.d: "Constantine XI married twice. The first time was on 1 July 1428 to Theodora Tocco, niece of Carlo I Tocco of Epirus. She died while giving birth to a stillborn daughter in November 1429. His second marriage was on 27 July 1441 to Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino of Lesbos, who died in August 1442 after suffering a miscarriage. He had no children by either marriage. After his coronation in 1449, Constantine XI sent a commission under George Sphrantzes asking Mara Brankovic, daughter of the Serbian Despot Ðurad Brankovic and Byzantine princess Irene Kantakouzene, to marry him. By then Mara was the widow of Murad II; she had been allowed to return to her parents in Serbia after the death of Murad. The proposal was welcomed by her father Ðurad Brankovic, but it foundered on the objection of Mara herself who had vowed that 'if God ever released her from the hands of the infidel she would lead a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her days'. Accordingly, the courtship failed and Sphrantzes took steps to arrange for a marriage with a princess either from the Empire of Trebizond or the Kingdom of Georgia. The choice eventually fell to an unnamed Georgian princess, daughter of George VIII. He started official negotiations with the Georgian king, who had sent an ambassador to Constantinople for that reason. It was agreed that the next spring, Sphrantzes would sail for Georgia to bring the bride to Constantinople, but Constantine's plans were overtaken by the events of 1453."

The Palaiologan has looked towards the West for help against the heathens, and have even converted to Catholicism to garner support. Ioannes VIII even secured a Union of the Churches at the Council of Florence, but opposition in the Byzantine Empire kept it from having any real power. If the Basileus had all the authority in the church, he may able to sway the people to convert to Catholicism, and hopefully gain more support in the West to kick out the Turks."
