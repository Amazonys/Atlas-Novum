 #Writing

 writing:0 "Writing"
 desc_writing:0 "Often considered one of the keystones to distinguish “civilization” from prior forms of human societal development, a writing system represents the structure of the spoken word through visual symbols or glyphs. Originating from simpler systems of mnemonics and ideographs, true writing first emerged in ancient southern Mesopotamia at the end of the 4th millennium BCE. Since that time, writing gradually spread across the known world, having been invented separately in ancient Egypt, China, and faraway southern Mexico.\nWith that said, it is beyond unlikely that another independent genesis of writing will occur now. For those complex civilizations across the globe who still lack a proper system of physical recordkeeping and literature, the burdens of prosperity and empire will grow ever more heavy with the passage of time. Unless writing is adopted - or adapted - those peoples will soon find themselves left behind."

The earliest lasting bureaucratic civil service, established alongside a set of codified laws, was born in 653 CE in the Tang Dynasty. The existence of a permanent, subordinate governing class selected partially by merit and provided with the needed resources, hierarchy and authority to succeed… is what builds states that last."

 desc_feudalism:0 "Over time, civilizations with sufficient levels of social stratification, population growth and institutionalized governance developed different forms of order as social roles became more clearly differentiated. Powerful estates developed around the pillars of religion, warfare, commerce, production, nobility, and scholarship. Often, multiple pillars fell under the same broad group, such as academia under the clergy in the Christian world, and commerce and artisanship under Fengjian in the Chinese-influenced East. These influential social cliques and organizations then pursued their own property interests, increased their influence and became important cornerstones of societal development, and their reciprocal relationship with the monarch and central government are critical to competent stewardship and remaining competitive with neighboring polities."

 #Scholasticism
 scholasticism:0 "Scholasticism"
 desc_scholasticism:0 "From the early 12th Century, the first true professional universities began to arise in Europe, in order to educate a new class of professionals in various fields of study such as theology, law and medicine. As a consequence, interest grew for access to information that had been lost to Latin Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Spurred on by the establishment of schools of translation in Italy and Spain, scholars revived the study of Ancient Greek philosophy in Europe, and in so doing imported many ideas from the Arabic-speaking world as well.\nThe influx of ideas from Plato, Aristotle and others posed a new threat to conventional Christian doctrine, and spurred an era of debate and synthesis of these ideas. As a result, scholasticism is not so much a philosophy or a theology as a method of learning, as it places a strong emphasis on dialectical reasoning to extend knowledge by inference and to resolve contradictions. This form of reasoning would come to act as the bedrock of modern Western legal systems for centuries to come."

The rediscovery of valuable eastern commodities such as silk and spices prompted the revival of trade, a return of banking and the dawn of the modern bullion and currency-based economies. Local, self-sufficient fiefdoms now give way to interlocked regional trade networks extending as far as the port of Quanzhou in China. Loopholes around usury enable the first modern financial instruments, and the merchants begin their rise to prominence."

This increased spending power in the populace has propelled the merchant-artisan class ever higher. Loans and investments from merchant banks have become central to the financial planning of leaders everywhere.\nRegained trust in bullion allows for stable, universally accepted coinage with which to conduct increasingly complex transactions. Banks and brokerages provide the security needed to undertake risky long-distance and high cost-of-entry overseas trade. Modern finance will eventually make the most powerful engines of European dominance - the central bank, the stock exchange and the company sovereign. Whatever the future may hold, it will undoubtedly require financial institutions."

 #Renaissance

 desc_renaissance:0 "Originating in Florence in the mid-14th Century, the Renaissance describes a transitional period in philosophy, statecraft, learning and expression that marked the dawn of the early modern era. The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas, and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy - such as that of Protagoras, who said that "man is the measure of all things". This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature.\nThe spread of Renaissance thinking was especially gradual and uneven, taking off especially quickly in Italy, but it will only gain traction across Europe proper after the invention of moveable type. Renaissance Humanism will take the better part of a century to grow into a more mature movement, one that shall permeate all aspects of society."

 # Mass Media
 printing_press:0 "Mass Media"
 desc_printing_press:0 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and revolutionary ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-nationalism, and accelerated the development of European vernaculars, to the detriment of Latin.\nPrint gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print gave assurance that the work of the Renaissance would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the Middle Ages would never recur, that not an idea would be lost."

With the bloodshed of the early- to mid-17th century, the old order has finally begun to give way, as exhausted and battered participants across the continent seek to ensure that internal dissent will no longer grant other countries the right to meddle with their affairs. Each recognized state will from now on be responsible for their own, and only their own domestic policy.

From this flourishing have come a range of ideas centered on the value of human happiness, the pursuit of knowledge obtained by means of reason and the evidence of the senses, and ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state.\nSapere aude - dare to know."

 # Capitalism
 manufactories:0 "Capitalism"
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. In the mid-18th century a group of economic theorists, led by David and Adam Smith, challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines - such as the belief that the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state. Magnates have begun to replace merchants as the dominant factor in the capitalist system, and are a new impetus behind the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of artisans, guilds and journeymen. These forerunners of later industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor, rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."

 # Nationalism
 nationalism_i:0 "Nationalism"
 desc_nationalism_i:0 "Out of the fires of revolution has come a new political convention - the conception of a “nation” and one’s place within it. Without a monarch or a divine mandate, though happy to work through and within those power structures, nationalism embraces a long historical heritage of togetherness that designates a single people and culture as a “nation”. Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference, that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power. It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on shared social characteristics of culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics, religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity. Combined with the dawn of liberalism on the world stage, this movement has inspired radicals to call for the unification of divided peoples, desire for autonomy or liberation from those who now recognize themselves as a people distinct from their distant rulers, and renewed battles for freedom of New World colonies from overseas control. The public discourse created by the Enlightenment now reaches its zenith, as the people themselves seize control of defining their own identity."

 # Industrialism
 industrialization:0 "Industrialism"
 desc_industrialization:0 "Broader processes of globalization carried capitalism across the world. By the beginning of the nineteenth century a series of loosely connected market systems had come together as a relatively integrated global system, in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization. Industrialization allows cheap production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth creates sustained demand for commodities. More people are pouring into the cities as home industry shifts to factory work, and the last gasps of the landed gentry have been drowned out by the triumphant clamor of middle-class business. With mass production and urbanization comes vast social changes, increasing consumer choice dramatically. Where once laborers ate from metal platters with wooden implements, ordinary workers now dine on Wedgwood porcelain. Consumers have come to demand an array of new household goods and furnishings - metal knives and forks, for example, as well as rugs, carpets, mirrors, cooking ranges, pots, pans, watches, clocks, and a dizzying array of furniture. The age of mass consumption has arrived."
