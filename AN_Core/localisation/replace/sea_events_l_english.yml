Having learnt that the neighboring Siamese had claimed rights over Malacca, the Portuguese viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, sent three envoys to Ayutthaya in an attempt to establish friendly relations. The third of these envoys, led by Duarte de Coelho, concluded with a treaty signed between Portugal and Siam. In exchange for guns and ammunition, the Siamese guaranteed religious freedoms, and agreed to facilitate the efforts of the Portuguese in establishing local settlements and trade networks. As many as three hundred Portuguese nationals later settled down in Ayutthaya, with many traders and military experts being among them."

In 1548, the young King Kaeofa was executed at Khok Phraya Temple, and Lady Si Sudachan declared Khun Chinnarat king, styling him King Worawongsa. The two, both being members of the deposed Uthong clan, were met with nationwide opposition from the other noble houses, who despised the immoral and brutal return of Uthong. United under the banner of the Suphannaphum clan, members of the Sukhothai, Suphannaphum, and Si Thammarat clans united against Uthong, and assassinated the usurper and his adulteress, handing over the throne to Prince Thian, who was proclaimed King Maha Chakkraphat."

 capture_of_malacca.1.d:0 "The first Portuguese references to Malacca appeared after Vasco da Gama returned from his expedition to Calicut. The city was described as being a forty day journey away from India, where clove, nutmeg, porcelains and silk were sold in abundance. Supposedly, the city was ruled by a Christian sovereign, who could amass an army of ten thousand men for war, which prompted King Manuel to find the city. A first expedition was launched in 1509, but ultimately failed, resulting in the capture of most of the soldiers at the hands of the Sultan. In 1511, the Viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, launched a second expedition to seize Malacca. In July, following a rejected ultimatum to release all the prisoners from the 1509 expedition, the Sultan strengthened his defenses to prepare for an inevitable invasion. Over the course of two assaults, Albuquerque's men conquered the city, pillaging the households of those not allied to the Portuguese. The Sultan of Malacca tried several times to retake the city, but all attempts failed, leading to the eventual downfall of the Sultanate."
