When the starting conditions are fulfilled for a Crisis, its progress begins to tick up every month at a rate depending on a separate set of modifiers. Some crises can occur instantly, while others may spread throughout many countries in a specific region. A ticking crisis can be stopped completely by fulfilling a set of stopping conditions that are separate from its starting conditions. When progress reaches 100% the Crisis starts and will continue until its ending conditions are fulfilled. Some crises can prove to be important crucibles, potentially improving your country's status quo substantially; whereas others are best avoided wherever possible..."
