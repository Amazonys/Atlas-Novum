Parrots have featured prominently in human culture for millennia. So valued is their relative intelligence and colorful feathers that Parrots have been the hallmark of wealth and royalty and occasionally divinity the world over. Falcons and Hawks have likewise been trained as for thousands of years as birds of prey and occasional message carriers. Cockatoos, Macaws, and Flamingos, though lower in population, are valued for their rarity and beauty."

Skin was turned into tipis, drums, and water bags. Hides were fashioned into beds, blankets, clothing. Not the smallest part was wasted. The stomach became a soup kettle. Horns were carved into spoons. Bones into knives, awls, and needles. Sinews were used for bowstring and thread. Ribs were used as sled frames, hooves became rattles for children. Even the mighty skull was used as a sacred altar. When the Bison were massacred for sport by colonists, the native way of life died with them."

Dates, a flowering plant species part of the Arecaceae palm family, have been a staple food of the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years.

With the arrival of the Europeans and its trade around the world, the crop was slowly bred to be more nutritious and flavorful.

Through pre-Columbian trade, the Polynesians obtained the sweet potato. With the advent of the Trans-Atlantic Exchange, the potato quickly became the staple of choice amongst Europe's poor. Indeed, countries that suffered significant starvation like Ireland and Latvia were able to mitigate it through the widespread circulation of potatoes."

Early into the Renaissance, shortages of gold in Europe led to the opening of many silver mines across Lower Germany and the Balkans. Furthermore, with the discovery of the New World, silver rapidly became a currency standard, which would have far-reaching effects when its export from the Americas was eventually exhausted."

A ticking crisis can be stopped completely by fulfilling a set of stopping conditions that are separate from its starting conditions. When progress reaches 100% the Crisis starts and will continue until its ending conditions are fulfilled. Some crises can prove to be important crucibles, potentially improving your country's status quo substantially; whereas others are best avoided wherever possible..."
