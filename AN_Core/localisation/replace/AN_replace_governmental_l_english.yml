While they do get a certain salary for being at our disposal this is by no means enough to support a family and the state has often tolerated and even encouraged the soldiers to have alternate means of income.\nSome fear, however, that our levies are ill-equipped to fight as professional soldiers, and that they lack interest in keeping their equipment up to date or in good shape."

Often this position is unavoidable given the feudal nature of the realm.
