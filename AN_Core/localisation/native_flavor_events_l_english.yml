 native_americans.1.t:0 "Frozen Lands"
 native_americans.1.d:0 "When our people first arrived in [Root.GetName], we knew that this harsh environment would test the bounds of our resourcefulness. We remained confident, but this winter the cold is even fiercer and extends its reach even further. One band claims that mankind was never meant to live in these lands and wishes to return to a climate where our way of life is tried and tested."
 native_americans.1.a:0 "Our way of life is to adapt. Send others to teach them."
 native_americans.1.b:0 "Let them leave if they so wish."
 native_americans.2.t:0 "Parched Lands"
 native_americans.2.d:0 "When our people first arrived in [Root.GetName], we knew that this harsh environment would test the bounds of our resourcefulness. We remained confident, but this summer the scorching heat is even fiercer and extends its reach even further. One band claims that mankind was never meant to live in these lands and wishes to return to a climate where our way of life is tried and tested."
 native_americans.2.a:0 "Our way of life is to adapt. Send others to teach them."
 native_americans.2.b:0 "Let them leave if they so wish."
 native_americans.3.t:0 "Our New Home in the North"
 native_americans.3.d:0 "Our tribe has thrived by traveling, and so we must learn to thrive where we travel. Since our last venture, this has proven difficult. In [Root.GetName], the temperature and weather are harsh and inhospitable, particularly in the winter. Fortunately, a neighboring tribe has lived here for long and has learned to hunt and harvest in this snow-covered landscape. Some of them seem willing to teach us."
 native_americans.3.a:0 "In our past home, we were wise, but here, they are wiser."
 native_americans.3.b:0 "We learn better from the land itself."
 native_americans.4.t:0 "Our New Home in the Desert"
 native_americans.4.d:0 "Our tribe has thrived by traveling, and so we must learn to thrive where we travel. Since our last venture, this has proven difficult. In [Root.GetName], the temperature and weather are harsh and inhospitable, particularly in the summer. Fortunately, a neighboring tribe has lived here for long and has learned to hunt and harvest in this barren landscape. Some of them seem willing to teach us."
 native_americans.4.a:0 "In our past home, we were wise, but here, they are wiser."
 native_americans.4.b:0 "We learn better from the land itself."
 native_americans.5.t:0 "Counting Coup"
 native_americans.5.d:0 "Bravery is a valued trait among our warriors, and this is reflected in many of our traditions. One such is counting coups, recording acts of courage in battle, which serve both to mark our greatest soldiers and to inspire new recruits. However, since we put $ARMY_REFORMER$ to the task of reforming our army, they have been questioning this practice, calling for our military to focus on more practical goals and efficiency in killing our enemies."
 native_americans.5.a:0 "$ARMY_REFORMER$ is right. More than the spirit of courage, we need results."
 native_americans.5.b:0 "$ARMY_REFORMER$ sounds like a coward."
 native_americans.6.t:0 "Appointing a War Chief"
 native_americans.6.d:0 "We are at war, and while [Root.Monarch.GetName] ruled our people wisely in peacetime, we may need a respected warrior to lead us to victory."
 native_americans.6.a:0 "Select a war chief among the proven veterans."
 native_americans.6.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a capable chief, even in war."
 native_americans.7.t:0 "Appointing a Peace Chief"
 native_americans.7.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was chosen chief for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bravery in combat, to lead our nation during the war. Now that the war is over, we need a chief who sees beyond the battlefield, to the needs of our nation in times of peace.\n\nTradition dictates that the War Chief respects this, to avoid abusing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority."
 native_americans.7.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] must step back. A Peace Chief will be selected."
 native_americans.7.b:0 "Authority will safeguard our nation. There is no such thing as peacetime!"
 native_americans.8.t:0 "Those who Travel and Those who Stay"
 native_americans.8.d:0 "Ancient stories tell how our people traveled far to reach this land, the land we now work and call our home. Although that time is now past, some of our neighbors retain this way of life, moving to new hunting grounds rather than building permanent homes. We have no interest in returning to those ways, but perhaps we could exchange knowledge and goods between our tribes, acknowledging the benefits of both our choices."
 native_americans.8.a:0 "We are willing to listen if they are."
 native_americans.8.a.tt:0 "Send a messenger to suggest exchanging resources and knowledge. What do the [This.GetName] say?"
 native_americans.8.b:0 "What can we learn from those who can't even build proper homes?"
 native_americans.9.d:0 "A messenger from [From.GetName] has arrived. Unlike many diplomatic envoys, he speaks not of the similarities between our tribes, but of the differences: How we remain wandering the world, while they have built permanent settlements in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Apparently, they believe these differences mean we have much to gain from trading what our different customs yield, both insights and goods."
 native_americans.9.a:0 "They are wise to see our strengths, as we shall see theirs."
 native_americans.9.b:0 "They are simply complacent and envy our freedom."
 native_americans.10.d:0 "The messenger we sent to [From.GetName] has returned. Unfortunately, they care little for our efforts at mutual understanding, considering our cultural developments a dead end and their own customs more honorable."
 native_americans.10.a:0 "Their loss."
 native_americans.11.d:0 "The messenger we sent to [From.GetName] has returned. The smaller tribe was happy to hear us acknowledging that they may have something to give us, and accepted our suggestion of cultural and material exchanges."
 native_americans.11.a:0 "We will both benefit from their understanding."
 native_americans.12.t:0 "Holy Smoke"
 native_americans.12.d:0 "Tobacco has always been of use to our tribe. Some view the plant medicine, some as sacred, while others simply find inhalation of the smoke relaxing. However, the recreational use of the plant has spread in recent years, leading to discussions among the elders in [Root.GetName] about whether the people are abusing this gift. It has been suggested that the use of tobacco be restricted to ceremonies where the plant is essential, to prevent youths from listlessly wasting it."
 native_americans.12.a:0 "A reasonable suggestion."
 native_americans.12.b:0 "Let the youths use it as they like."
 native_americans.13.t:0 "Abandoned Lands"
 native_americans.13.d:0 "The bands who have moved into [From.GetName] claim the resources in the area are scarce and the land has seen better days.\n\nSome bands claim that this is simply a matter of the buffalo leaving recently, but others point to a neighboring tribe known for traveling to new hunting grounds. They accuse them of having used up the land and left it depleted."
 native_americans.13.a:0 "This is a natural consequence of migrations, and we must accept it."
 native_americans.13.b:0 "If they have moved to more fertile land, we shall take that instead!"
 native_americans.14.t:0 "Preparing for the Sun Dance"
 native_americans.14.d:0 "Our people are beginning preparations for the Sun Dance, a sacred ceremony held during the warmer months of the year. Although this is an important event, it puts a lot of strain on the practitioners, many of whom are young warriors. We also need to put aside resources for the ceremony. This year, there has been some discussion about whether or not to devote ourselves completely to the Sun Dance, or to celebrate it on a smaller scale."
 native_americans.14.a:0 "The Sun Dance requires our full attention!"
 native_americans.14.a.tt:0 "The Sun Dance will be performed this year when the preparations are finished."
 native_americans.14.b:0 "Keep it a minor event this year."
 native_americans.15.t:0 "The Sun Dance"
 native_americans.15.d:0 "Having spent months in preparation for the Sun Dance, we can now go through with it in full scale. Our people gather together to fast, pray and dance, which not only preserves this sacred tradition, but also aids in bringing our often scattered tribes closer to each other."
 native_americans.15.a:0 "All people of the [Root.GetName] are our people."
 native_americans.16.t:0 "Hunters or Workers of the Soil"
 native_americans.16.d:0 "As a tribe who follow the buffalo, we take pride in our skill as hunters. Our stay in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has allowed us to hone these skills, but some council members have begun to suggest that we are too dependent on them. They suggest that the lands of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] holds the potential for more than hunting and foraging, and that we would do well to start considering the benefits of agriculture. Perhaps we could even settle here."
 native_americans.16.a:0 "If we are to farm, we should do it here."
 native_americans.16.b:0 "What time we have, we should devote to hunting."
 native_americans.17.t:0 "By Fire"
 native_americans.17.d:0 "Since time immemorial, the use of fire has been a mark of mankind's ability to invent and destroy. Our homeland is shaped by controlled fires, used to manage crops and wild animals as well as clearing the surroundings.\n\nRecent efforts to extend the use of these methods in [Root.GetName] has been called into question. Some of the elders believe it to be unnecessarily risky, but local leaders consider it necessary for continued development in the province."
 native_americans.17.a:0 "We have faith in our mastery of the flames."
 native_americans.17.a.tt:0 "the controlled fires succeeding improving yield in the province."
 native_americans.17.a.tt2:0 "the fires growing out of control."
 native_americans.17.b:0 "Let's not take unnecessary risks."
 native_americans.18.t:0 "Fire Successful"
 native_americans.18.d:0 "The use of fire to alter the landscape in [Root.GetName] has paid off. Clearing vegetation has allowed us to make better use of the land and will increase yields from the area for years to come."
 native_americans.18.a:0 "As the world shapes us, we shape the world."
 native_americans.19.t:0 "Fire out of Control"
 native_americans.19.d:0 "The fears of [Root.Owner.GetName] elders turned out to be justified. The fires used to reshape the lands of [Root.GetName], though initially under control, spread beyond their intended area, causing damages and chaos. The council is now in dispute with local leaders, with everyone seeking to assign blame to others."
 native_americans.19.a:0 "We must be more careful in the future."
 native_americans.20.t:0 "Straying Son"
 native_americans.20.d:0 "Bands forming and splitting up is a fairly common occurrence and does not normally generate serious disputes, but a recent case has required our intervention. A son is leaving his father's band with a large group of followers against the will of his parents. The father requests we intervene on his behalf to keep the band together and avoid weakening his authority in the tribe."
 native_americans.20.a:0 "The son stays. He should know better."
 native_americans.20.b:0 "Bands need to be flexible. The split should be allowed."
 native_americans.21.t:0 "Large Band Splits Up"
 native_americans.21.d:0 "One of the largest bands in our tribe have discussed splitting and going separate ways, both away from our home in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They argue that they could accomplish more this way, but the split may force us to reorganize much of our current society, especially since people are leaving the center of our nation."
 native_americans.21.a:0 "Let them split and accomplish more."
 native_americans.21.b:0 "We need them in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 native_americans.22.t:0 "Hunters on the Move"
 native_americans.22.d:0 "Although we have long since given up nomadic life, some bands still live primarily as hunters and need to remain on the move. As wild game moves to new lands, hunters must follow, but this is causing trouble for the people of [Root.GetName], where the community is now divided on the issue. Some locals argue that these bands are behind the times and should settle where they now live."
 native_americans.22.a:0 "Let them hunt, let them move."
 native_americans.22.b:0 "We'll provide them with the crops they need to settle down."
 native_americans.23.t:0 "Art of Weaving"
 native_americans.23.d:0 "Ever since our exchanges with the Pueblo improved our knowledge about weaving methods, we have improved our weaves beyond pure craftsmanship. The patterns and colors developed now constitute their own distinctive art form, known to throughout neighboring tribes and beyond. [From.GetName] has provided us with the materials to create more of these famous fabrics than ever."
 native_americans.23.a:0 "We shall hone this art."
 native_americans.24.t:0 "Mound Builders"
 native_americans.24.d:0 "Since the settlers arrived from Europe, there has been much speculation among them about the origin of the ancient burial mounds in the region. The settlers refuse to believe our ancestors could have built such structures, being unimpressed with our current construction projects. While they are clearly fascinated by the mounds, they seem to dismiss both us and our neighbors as unable to create anything of lasting value."
 native_americans.24.a:0 "We'll just have to prove them wrong by continuing the tradition!"
 native_americans.24.b:0 "Their ignorance is not our problem."
