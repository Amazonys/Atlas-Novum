Trading with the natives yielded more gold than they had come across previously on the other Caribbean islands and Columbus was led to believe that much more gold would be found inland. Before he could explore further, his flagship, the Santa Maria, ran aground and sank in the bay on December 24. With only two smaller ships remaining for the voyage home, Columbus built a fortified encampment, La Navidad, on the shore and left behind 21 crewman to await his return the following year. Colonization began in earnest the following year when Columbus brought 1,300 men to Hispaniola in November 1493 with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement. They found the encampment at Navidad had been destroyed and all the crewmen left behind killed by the natives. We must settle Hispaniola, as we believe the island to contain great riches that are better off in our coffers!"

They allied with the Spanish, and when Cortés decided to go inland to Tenochtitlan, the Totonacas guided them to other subject peoples who would be willing to ally with them, including and especially the Tlaxcalans. However, after entering Tlaxcalan territory, the Spanish were met by a hostile Tlaxcalan force of 30,000. The Tlaxcalans fought the Spanish and their Indian allies in a number of battles, with the Spanish inflicting heavy casualties on the Tlaxcalans despite their superior numbers.

The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.

In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of Cristóbal de Olid was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight. Tangáxuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cortés and Tangáxuan considered themselves rulers of Michoacán for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both.

After this, the Jesuits began to move into Pima and Tohono O'odham territories. Spanish exploration and missionary work was sufficient to consider the territory part of New Spain. An agreement between General Pedro de Perea and the viceroy of New Spain resulted in the general shaping of the province, initially called Nueva Navarra in 1637, but renamed Sonora in 1648.

 bri_anjou_dukedom_title:0 "The Duchy of Anjou"
 bri_anjou_dukedom_desc:0 "The Duke of Anjou, Rene, leads a pitiful lifestyle, being a lapdog for the King of France. Having already lost one kingdom of his own, he has retired back to France, as well as being the Duke of Bar and Lorraine. Such a man is not fit to rule, and as one of the strongest leaders in the region it just makes sense for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to assume responsibilities here too."
 bri_seize_east_normandy_title:0 "The Triple Dukedom"
 bri_seize_east_normandy_desc:0 "Already ruling over two Dukedoms, Brittany and Anjou, it's about time that we ruled over some more. Contentin in Lower Normandy was historically Breton owned, so it isn't that far of a stretch to say we have rights to the whole Duchy, right? By diplomacy, or by force, bring our third Duchy into the fold."
 bri_chase_Leroi_title:0 "Chase Le Roi"
 bri_chase_Leroi_desc:0 "We have already proven ourselves in battle against the French King, having taken Paris and successfully controlling the North. However they remain in exile in the South, and will undoubtedly be looking to retake the land. We must take our place as Ruler of all of France, seizing any personal holdings from them and once and for all bring peace to our Kingdom."
 bri_western_france_title:0 "Establish New France"
 bri_western_france_desc:0 "Having already established a New Brittany, a duchy under the Kingdom of France, it only makes sense if we're to establish more territories in the New World that it would be a 'New France'. We shall expand our presence in the region to lock in our monopoly of trade and wealth in Canada."

 #Bulgaria
 bul_independent_title:0 "Independent Bulgaria"
 bul_independent_desc:0 "In the late 14th century, the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria and made it into the core of Rumelia, or “Roman Province”, which encompassed the Balkan section of the Ottoman Empire & was the richest Ottoman region. At long last, by the grace of God, the Bulgarian people are at last, free from the Ottoman yoke! No longer shall we be slaves & beholden to the tyrannical heathen Turks who claim to be our masters, it's Bulgaria's turn now to be the master!"

 bul_north_bulgaria_title:0 "Retake North Bulgaria"
 bul_north_bulgaria_desc:0 "Moesia was settled by Slavs during the 7th century. Bulgars, arriving from Old Great Bulgaria, conquered Lower Moesia by the end of the 7th century. During the 8th century the Byzantine Empire lost also Upper Moesian territory to the First Bulgarian Empire, then several centuries later, the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria in the late 14th century. We are now one more step closer to returning Bulgaria to her former glory by retaking our old lands of Moesia!"

 bul_bulgaria_title:0 "Reclaim Bulgaria"
 bul_bulgaria_desc:0 "The Byzantine Empire retained control over Thrace until the 7th century when the northern half of the entire region was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire and the remainder was reorganized in the Thracian theme. The Empire regained the lost regions in the late 10th century until the Bulgarians regained control of the northern half at the end of the 12th century. In 1352, the Ottoman Turks conducted their first incursion into the region subduing it completely within a matter of two decades and occupying it for five centuries. We've managed to retake our old lands of upper Thrace, this will now give us a nice staging ground that'll enable us to more easily march into & eventually take the whole of Thrace itself!"

 bul_macedonia_title:0 "A Macedonian Expedition"
 bul_macedonia_desc:0 "The region of Macedonia was ruled by the First Bulgarian Empire throughout the 9th and the 10th century after they gained it via conquest from the Byzantines, but it was later lost to the Byzantines & was then eventually lost to the Ottomans. We've managed to take back the old lands of Macedonia that were the political & cultural heartland of the First Bulgarian Empire, the same very lands which the Great Conqueror Alexander himself once hailed from, we shall ensure history repeats itself, with us Bulghars as the next great Conquerors!"

 bul_thessaly_title:0 "The Greek Connection"
 bul_thessaly_desc:0 "In 977 Byzantine Thessaly was raided by the Bulgarian Empire. In 1066 dissatisfaction with the taxation policy led the Aromanian and Bulgarian population of Thessaly to revolt against the Byzantine Empire under the leadership of a local lord, Nikoulitzas Delphinas. The revolt, which began in Larissa, soon expanded to Trikala and later northwards to the Byzantine-Bulgarian border but ultimately failed. With Thessaly now in Bulgarian hands, with it's famed horses now available to us, we are now free to conquer & penetrate deeper into Greece."

 bul_athens_title:0 "The Bulgarian Pantheon"
 bul_athens_desc:0 "Greece came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century, in the decades before and after the fall of Constantinople. This is a proud moment for all Bulgarians everywhere, we have managed to pull off the amazing feat of conquering the entirety of Mainland Greece, something which even the mighty Persian Empire of old could not achieve! We now rule the Hellenes, we now lord over the oldest city in the World, Athens!"

 bul_constantinople_title:0 "City of Bulgar's Desire"
 bul_constantinople_desc:0 "Adrianople, a major Byzantine city in Thrace, was conquered by the Ottomans sometime in the 1360s, and eventually became the Ottoman capital, until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Bulgarian nation & people have seemingly done the impossible, we have at last conquered all of Thrace, but not only that, we have conquered the City that was the New Rome, we have conquered the City that Constantine the Great of a united Roman Empire himself had founded so, so long ago, we have conquered the City which could not be conquered for a thousand years, now the entire World knows that we, the Bulgarian people, the New Bulgarian Empire have at long last, conquered the City of Constantinople, once the Heart of Rome, and the Center of Christian Orthoxy in the East!"

 bul_aegean_title:0 "Seize the Aegean Islands"
 bul_aegean_desc:0 "The Cyclades islands, in the middle of the Aegean, were officially annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, although they were under vassal status since the 1530s. Cyprus fell in 1571, and the Venetians retained Crete until 1669. With the conquest of the Aegean islands, we can now use them as naval bases to strike out at our enemies fleets who thought they could not be touched on the sea, but times have changed, and Bulgarian ships are going out in full force to tame the seas & take full control of our shores!"

 bul_serbia_title:0 "The Serbian Despotate"
 bul_serbia_desc:0 "The period after 1371, known as the Fall of the Serbian Empire saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the Battle of Kosovo 1389 against the rising Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans finally conquered the Serbian Despotate in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw massive migrations of Serbs to the west and north. We have further expanded our possessions & power by conquering Serbia to the West of us, these lands will provide us with plenty of Christian manpower that will happily help us fight against the Muslim Turks"

 bul_albania_title:0 "Albanian Mountains"
 bul_albania_desc:0 " In the first half of the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire invaded most of Albania, and the League of Lezhë was held under Skanderbeg as a ruler, who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history. With the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into Southeast Europe. They reached the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across Southern Albania in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431. We have now secured Albania under our stable rule, much to the joy of Albanian Christians, together, we shall continue to fight against heathen & heretics!"

 bul_transylvania_title:0 "Transylvanian Holdings"
 bul_transylvania_desc:0 "The Principality of Transylvania was a semi-independent state ruled primarily by Hungarian princes, It was usually under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, although the principality often had dual vassalage, Ottoman Turkish sultans and Habsburg Hungarian kings, in the 16th and 17th centuries. Now that we have conquered Transylvania, this enables us to put pressure on the powers that be up North, and it may also even allow us to militarily expand into nearby regions"

 bul_wallachia_title:0 "Retake Wallachia"
 bul_wallachia_desc:0 "Wallachia was under the control of the First Bulgarian Empire from its establishment in 681, until approximately the Hungarians' conquest of Transylvania at the end of the 10th century. We have now taken back all of the Wallachian lands that righfully belong to us, these lands will allow us to grow our military & economic strength, and can be used to potentially launch campaigns into nearby Poland & Hungary"

 bul_danube_title:0 "Up to The Danube"
 bul_danube_desc:0 "Between the late 14th and late 19th centuries, the Ottoman Empire competed first with the Kingdom of Serbia, Second Bulgarian Empire, Kingdom of Hungary, Principality of Wallachia, Principality of Moldavia and later with the Austrian Habsburgs, Polish?Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Russian Empire for controlling the Danube, which became the northern border of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. Many of the Ottoman?Hungarian Wars 1366?1526 and Ottoman?Habsburg wars 1526?1791 were fought along the river. We have now taken the strategically important Hungarian lands along the Danube, the Danube river itself will provide excellent border protection from hostile armies on the other side when fortified, this secure regions will give us some breathing room to focus our armies on more exposed fronts"

 bul_moldova_title:0 "Moldovan Principality"
 bul_moldova_desc:0 "For all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks took place at Cetatea Alba in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandrel's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Peter III Aaron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alexandrel to the throne in Suceava. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II. With the conquest of Moldova, we are now free to expand into Poland & Lithuania, taking lands in this region will enable us to grow even more powerful, putting previous Bulgarian Empires to shame!"
