There is no more perfect woman and her holy motherhood grants her a seat at the right hand of God. Or does it? Recently, radical theologians have been arguing that there is no need for such intercessions. Are they right, or is the holy mother church in danger from their almost heretical utterings?"

However, a monk has started a doctrinal dispute that verges on the edge of heresy, claiming that there is no purgatory and saying that prayers for the dead do not assist their passage into heaven.

 muslim_piety.1.t:1 "Spread of Extreme Practices in [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]"
 muslim_piety.1.d:1 "The late Middle Ages saw the emergence of several new forms of Islamic mysticism, one of the most controversial being a brand of Sufi dervishes known as the 'renunciationists'. These men sought to separate themselves entirely from normal society, shaving all body hair down to their eyebrows and publicly breaking the rules of the Sharia in order to demonstrate their unique relationship with God, all while wandering from town to town begging for alms. Our religious scholars are calling for their persecution, arguing that the uneducated populace's tendency to view them with awe will lead them away from the true faith."
 muslim_piety.1.a:1 "Expel them from [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]."
 muslim_piety.1.b:1 "Leave them be."
 muslim_piety.2.t:1 "Returning Scholars"
 muslim_piety.2.d:1 "Particularly in the aftermath of the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century, Egypt and Syria emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the Muslim world. Sunni scholars of every persuasion flocked to Damascus and Cairo to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all law, while Shi'ites traveled to Jabal Amil in Lebanon to meet with the scholars of orthodox Twelver Shi'ism. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home and hoping to implement legalistic Islam in our [Root.GovernmentName] just as they learned it in the heartlands of Islam."
 muslim_piety.2.a:1 "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
 muslim_piety.2.b:1 "Contact with the divine is not about studying books."
 muslim_piety.3.t:1 "Sufi Organizations Rally Support"
 muslim_piety.3.d:1 "During the early modern period popular forms of Sufi worship became extremely widespread in the Muslim world. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the sheikh of a major order has begun urging his followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
 muslim_piety.3.a:1 "We cannot rely on mystics for support!"
 muslim_piety.3.b:1 "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
 muslim_piety.4.t:1 "Religious Harmony"
 muslim_piety.4.d:1 "Just as many members of the Ulema have developed Sufi leanings, many of our Sufi orders have likewise come to extol the virtue of a pious life lived in accordance with the Sharia. Despite disapproving voices on both extremes, we have managed to strike a balance between mysticism and legalism. Our realm is currently enjoying the fruits of moderation and tolerance of differing religious practices."
 muslim_piety.4.a:1 "God is good."
 muslim_piety.5.t:1 "Debate over the Philosophy of Ibn Arabi"
 muslim_piety.5.d:1 "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. Ever since, debates have raged on over the compatibility of his philosophy with scholarly interpretations of Islam, with some going so far as to label him an unbeliever. For many Sufis, on the other hand, Ibn Arabi's philosophy became the foundational principle of their religious practice. Now we too are being asked to take sides."
 muslim_piety.5.a:1 "Deny the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.5.b:1 "Support the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.6.t:1 "Dhimmi Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.6.d:1 "Under Islamic Law, non-Muslims faced a number of restrictions on the construction of new buildings in urban centers: their houses were not to be taller than those of the Muslims, and they were not permitted to construct new centers of worship, only to maintain those which already existed. In practice, these rules often went unenforced, but as our realm shifts further toward a legalistic interpretation of Islam, key members of the Ulema are beginning to call for their stricter implementation."
 muslim_piety.6.a:1 "Enforce the letter of the law."
 muslim_piety.6.b:1 "Leave them to do as they please."
 muslim_piety.7.t:1 "Dhimmis Flout Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.7.d:1 "Despite being officially prohibited from constructing houses of worship and tall buildings, the Dhimmis in several provinces of our realm are openly disobeying the laws, and many of our qadis are too lax to respond, either because they see no harm in it or because of the hefty bribes they can earn for turning a blind eye."
 muslim_piety.7.a:1 "Increase enforcement efforts."
 muslim_piety.7.b:1 "Let the laws go unenforced."
 muslim_piety.8.t:1 "Enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong"
 muslim_piety.8.d:1 "Muslims are encouraged in the Qur'an to take an active role in their community in order to “enjoin right and forbid wrong.” While this command has been interpreted in many ways by Muslim scholars, it was sometimes used by reformist groups to justify the forceful spread of more extreme views. A group of charismatic mosque preachers in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have begun calling for the end of unorthodox religious practices and are inciting the populace against the Sufis, leading to violence and street battles."
 muslim_piety.8.a:1 "Stamp down on the movement."
 muslim_piety.8.b:1 "Offer them our support."
 muslim_piety.9.t:1 "Debate over Sufi Practices"
 muslim_piety.9.d:1 "Muslim scholars were not united on the question of the permissibility of Sufism. While most appreciated the heightened levels of religious devotion it inspired among the general population, some disapproved of how certain Sufis expressed their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, could at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the Ulema."
 muslim_piety.9.a:1 "Support the hardliners."
 muslim_piety.9.b:1 "Support the moderates."
 muslim_piety.10.t:1 "Purification of Tax Laws"
 muslim_piety.10.d:1 "Ensuring that the realm's laws operate in accordance with the sacred Sharia requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax-collection practices, and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years, and taking only what is permitted by the Sharia."
 muslim_piety.10.a:1 "The peasantry must be free from unlawful exactions."
 muslim_piety.10.b:1 "Reject the proposal."
 muslim_piety.11.t:1 "Mystics and Storytellers"
 muslim_piety.11.d:1 "Many among the Ulema would question the great influence that storytellers have over the life of common men. The traditional hero stories of our people are centuries old but they risk making a cult out of seriously distorted fates of historical figures. A prominent cleric in [storytellerprovince.GetAreaName] have taken a strong stand against the storytellers of the realm, and cautions that religious scholars of the past have warned that obsessive listening to stories could lead to false worship."
 muslim_piety.11.a:1 "We must ban offensive stories from the realm."
 muslim_piety.11.b:1 "There is nothing wrong in idealizing our ancestors."
 muslim_piety.12.t:1 "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
 muslim_piety.12.d:1 "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also very common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, sufism and often unorthodox adaption of the Sharia. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the Ulema to penetrate the urban milieu.\nAn artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by this man and then swear an oath of allegiance."
 muslim_piety.12.a:1 "This is unacceptable."
 muslim_piety.12.b:1 "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
 muslim_piety.13.t:1 "Social Dissent and Popular Sufism"
 muslim_piety.13.d:1 "The great stress that our government has placed on Legalism and the limiting of Mysticism in our society has had the effect of closely associating Sufism with resistance to central rule. In times of social distress many now look to the Mystical orders for spiritual guidance as an alternative to the highly legalistic Ulema and its [Root.GovernmentName] ally.\nAs tensions flare in [popular_sufism_province.GetName] an influential Sufi Master declared his support for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], potentially calming the situation."
 muslim_piety.13.a:1 "We cannot accept the support of a Mystic."
 muslim_piety.13.b:1 "God is good."
 muslim_piety.14.t:1 "Coffee and Tobacco"
 muslim_piety.14.d:1 "While they are quite new to our society the use of stimulants such as Coffee and Tobacco has spread quickly, with coffee houses now a common feature from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to [coffee_province.GetAreaName]. The popularity is especially marked among the Sufi orders. The novelty of these substances means that the religious establishment is divided on their proper use.\nMany strict legalists wants us to limit their use while others argue for caution, as both Coffee and Tobacco are very popular in our state. The local governor of [coffee_province.GetName] have now turned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] wanting to close down the local coffee houses that he believes have become meeting places for dissidents."
 muslim_piety.14.a:1 "Let us impose Restrictions."
 muslim_piety.14.b:1 "Let them have their coffee."
 muslim_piety.15.t:1 "Sufi Orders growing in popularity in [new_province.GetName]"
 muslim_piety.15.d:1 "Some of the more prevalent Sufi orders in [Root.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName] province. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [Root.GetAdjective] rule they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the province into our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 muslim_piety.15.a:1 "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
 muslim_piety.15.b:1 "This is excellent."
 muslim_piety.16.t:1 "Disregard of the Sharia?"
 muslim_piety.16.d:1 "The learned Ulema complain over the widespread flouting of Sharia rules in our [Root.GovernmentName]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us risking losing their support and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
 muslim_piety.16.a:1 "Let us follow their recommendations."
 muslim_piety.16.b:1 "We cannot give in to such threats."
 muslim_piety.17.t:1 "Building Restrictions Lapse"
 muslim_piety.17.d:1 "As our realm loses its zeal for legalistic Islam, it has become harder and harder for us to find and appoint qadis willing to fully implement our official restrictions on the construction of Dhimmi buildings. The law has, at this point, simply become unenforceable."
 muslim_piety.17.a:1 "Just as well."
 muslim_piety.20.t:1 "A New [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 muslim_piety.20.d:1 "Our nation has sorely lacked a firm guiding hand under the rule of [Root.Heir.GetName], a timid child, ill-prepared to face the dangers of the world. Fortunately for us all, one of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] uncles, and close advisors has decided to act. The child is now safely locked away where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can do no more harm. The advisor has been proclaimed our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and has sworn to provide our nation with the strong leadership it so desperately needs."
 muslim_piety.20.a:0 "May our new $MONARCHTITLE$'s rule be long and prosperous!"
 muslim_dlc.22.t:0 "Friday Prayers?"
 muslim_dlc.22.d:0 "The weekly congregational prayer has been a way for Islamic rulers to show their legitimacy for centuries. The long standing Sunni dominance where most Friday prayers have been in the name of the Sunni Caliphs and the worldly Sultans of the Sunni world, has however lead to the status of the prayers being very uncertain.\nMost among the Shia Ulema oppose the practice of the Friday prayers, but there are some who would see its role as a way to bind together society, Ulema and ruler, return to the Shia faithful of our country."

As Christendom reels from the shock, Byzantine refugees flock to the cities and courts of Europe, bringing with them old manuscripts of classical knowledge, tracts by Aristotle, Plato and Galen, and a thorough knowledge of both Latin and Greek.

 EVTDESC5064:1 "The [Root.GetNobilityName] often prove unruly subjects of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], seeking to resist any infringement on their autonomy and seizing any opportunity to strengthen their position. This often includes making common cause with foreign powers. Recently, several key figures appear to have struck an agreement with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName] to advocate a pro-[neighbour_country.GetAdjective] course of action in return for certain favors and promises. While not directly treasonable, this behavior is clearly detrimental to our interests; however, reining them in is likely to prove no easy matter."

 EVTNAME5065:0 "Assassination of Noble"
 EVTDESC5065:1 "The noble families are the bulwark of our power. However, they are not a united force and are locked in a constant struggle against each other for influence and power. As time marches on, some noble houses might see their fortunes rise while others could lose all their power, the resulting envy leading to bitter rivalries and recriminiations. Recently, one of these rivalries boiled over into outright conflict as [Root.assassinated_dude.GetName], the leader of a powerful noble house, was assassinated by his rivals. Furious, his surviving relatives are preparing their violent revenge..."

Desperate for more lands and titles, they look with envy towards the [Root.GetClergyName], who own considerable land. They ask that we transfer church land to them in return for a large cash contribution to the [Root.GetStateForm]'s efforts. Of course, in the long term, we'd lose out on tax revenues from church lands in return for this short-term boost in revenue."

 EVTOPTB5066:0 "Decline."
 EVTNAME5068:0 "Sale of Offices"
 EVTDESC5068:0 "The crown often resorted to short term cash grabs like the sale of government offices. These sales would bring in a lot of revenue but in the long term, more officials meant more tax revenue siphoned off before it reached the royal treasury."

 EVTNAME5070:0 "Monopoly Company Formed"
 EVTDESC5070:1 "The realm often grants trading companies the exclusive rights to traffic goods in a region in exchange for a lump-sum payment and continuing revenues from the traders.

 EVTNAME5071:0 "Nobles Demand Increased Pensions"
 EVTDESC5071:1 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has to employ many methods to keep the unruly nobles in line. One of the most common is cold hard cash.

 EVTNAME5072:0 "Grant Export Licenses"
 EVTDESC5072:1 "Instead of paying cash to the nobles, another option is to grant them privileges to collect special revenues, for example from foreign trade, from which they can make a healthy profit. A proposal has recently reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ears to grant several noble families export licenses for our trade with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName]. Doing so would please them greatly, but the commercial classes may view the matter less favorably..."

 EVTNAME5073:0 "New Land Claimed"
 EVTDESC5073:1 "Our authorities in [Root.GetName] have managed to open up new land for our people by clearing a dense forest that previously made a large area of land inhospitable for settlement. These newly cleared areas will surely lead to a population boom there."

 EVTOPTA5075:0 "Accept demands"
 EVTOPTB5075:0 "Reject demands"
 EVTNAME5076:0 "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 EVTDESC5076:1 "As we look to centralize the state, we inevitably infringe on the autonomy of the urban dwellers, who have always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren. The cities actively resist pressure to be brought under more uniform rules and regulations, and demand that their old rights be respected."
 EVTOPTA5076:1 "Deny them their old rights!"
 EVTOPTB5076:1 "Accept their demands."
 EVTNAME5077:0 "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"
 EVTDESC5077:1 "Although the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issues many ordinances, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is in practice almost powerless to enforce them. Instead, enforcement depends upon the local powers - regional nobility and city governments - that are not always as vigilant as would be desired. Recently, it has come to our attention that our authorities in [troublesome_province.GetAreaName] are being particularly reticent in enforcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s will."
 EVTOPTA5077:0 "Let them handle it."

 EVTNAME5082:1 "The [Root.GetBurghersName] Request Privileges"
 EVTDESC5082:1 "The [Root.GetBurghersName] have grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government.

 EVTOPTB5083:0 "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5084:0 "Foreign Drill Instructor Available"
 EVTDESC5084:1 "The [drill_instructor_country.GetAdjective] drillmasters have become masters at the art of training troops to use firearms even more effectively. However, their methods are not a secret - far from it. In fact, entrepreneurial [drill_instructor_country.GetAdjective] veterans are now making a living for themselves by offering their knowledge to the rulers of all of Europe.

 EVTOPTB5084:0 "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5085:0 "Build a Great Palace"
 EVTDESC5085:1 "Monarchs often struggling to subdue the nobility and secure their standing in the eyes of their peers. The rise of firearms has reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. In order to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied, many monarchs are increasingly creating grand new palaces and introducing elaborate court rituals. [Root.GetUsableNameCap] is no different, and we have instructed our chief architect to draw up plans for a new palace to be built."

 EVTOPTB5085:0 "Don't build it."
 EVTNAME5086:0 "Uncooperative Philosopher"
 EVTDESC5086:1 "The philosopher [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has not shied back from expressing opinions contrary to those of both the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] and the Holy Church. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHisCap] latest publishings appear to have been particularly provocative, so much so that the Church is demanding we hand [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] over to their inquisitors to be tried for heresy and "persuaded" to recant. Denying the them this would anger the Church greatly, but [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has many supporters among the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligentsia."

 EVTNAME5087:0 "Boundary Dispute"
 EVTDESC5087:1 "The lack of good maps or tools to create accurate maps has helped our cause in the border region of [claim_province.GetAreaName]. Our local authorities have been able to make use of certain ambiguities to make a convincing case that [claim_province.GetName] should in fact belong to [Root.Owner.GetUsableName], rather than to [claim_province.Owner.GetUsableName]. Should we press these claims, or would it be better to let them slide?"

 EVTNAME5088:0 "Merchants harassed"
 EVTDESC5088:2 "Our merchants have long complained about the unfair treatment they have suffered in [harassing_merchants_nation.GetUsableName]. Recently, however, these complaints have escalated and the merchants now claim to be victims of [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] brigandage and privateering - attacks they insist were carried out with the tacit support of the [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] [harassing_merchants_nation.GetRulerTitleOrRegency].

 EVTOPTA9012:0 "Tell me more of their ideas!"
 EVTOPTB9012:0 "Tell me more of their people!"
 EVTNAME9014:0 "Fumi-e in $PROVINCENAME$"
 EVTDESC9014:1 "Fumi-e (literally 'stepping-on-pictures') were objects produced during the Edo period to reveal hidden Christians. The practice consisted of forcing suspected Christian to trample on Christian iconography to prove their 'innocence' with regards to secret Christian worship. A local daimyo has had success in combating the local Kirishitan community by applying this innovative method."
 EVTOPTA9014:0 "Interesting development."
 EVTNAME9016:0 "Tempura Introduced"
 EVTDESC9016:0 "A new delicacy has spread to one of our provinces where it has been given approval by local connoisseurs. The dish consists of battered and deep-fried vegetables and fish, and has become known as 'Tempura'. The dish has apparently been introduced by Portuguese missionaries!"
 EVTOPTA9016:0 "Let us make it a tradition!"
 EVTOPTB9016:0 "Let us sell it far and wide!"
 EVTNAME9018:0 "A Batch of Western Arquebuses"
 EVTDESC9018:0 "Traders in one of our provinces have brought in a party of Western Arquebuses for our armed forces. We could buy this state-of-the-art technology, but it will not be cheap, and the muskets will not last forever."
 EVTOPTA9018:0 "Naturally we want the weapons."
 EVTOPTB9018:0 "The old ways are better."
 EVTNAME9020:0 "Kabuki Theater"
 EVTDESC9020:0 "A play in the new Kabuki style of drama has been performed in $CAPITAL$, and we are set to gain. The performers are excellent, and one of them could potentially become a highly productive court playwright. On the other hand, having this troupe out on the road is bound to improve our standing in the eyes of others."
 EVTOPTA9020:0 "Send them far afield!"
 EVTOPTB9020:0 "This man is needed in the court!"
 EVTNAME9022:0 "Ronin Offers His Service"
 EVTDESC9022:0 "A 'Ronin', a masterless Samurai, has offered his services at our court. The man is young, and his talents are not yet fully developed. We could either give the man a chance to develop these talents, or send him off to less prestigious posts."
 EVTOPTA9022:0 "His talents will blossom at our court!"
 EVTOPTB9022:0 "We do have a garrison somewhere in need of a captain."
 EVTOPTC9022:0 "We have no need of brigands and wayfarers."
 EVTNAME9024:0 "Nogaku Performance"
 EVTDESC9024:0 "The Noh, or Nogaku, is a traditional Japanese form of musical drama, and the performance tonight of a newly written piece at our court in $CAPITAL$ has been hailed as the most beautiful play in several years."
 EVTOPTA9024:0 "Make it a part of our cultural heritage!"
 EVTOPTB9024:0 "We are truly a patron of the arts."
 EVTNAME9026:0 "Karesansui Garden"
 EVTDESC9026:0 "One of your retainers has suggested that we build a 'Karesansui' (dry landscape) garden at a palace in one of our provinces. An impressive rock garden could be a cultural beacon for our clan for years to come, but, of course, there are costs associated with planning and building one."
 EVTOPTA9026:0 "Of course we must have one!"
 EVTOPTB9026:0 "I do not think that this is the time."
 EVTNAME9028:0 "Loyal Samurai"
 EVTDESC9028:0 "Several of the Samurai in our service have served us long and faithfully. Tradition dictates that this caste of our most loyal warriors must be rewarded by their master for their service. Our people expect us to reward these Samurai, and not doing so will mean destabilizing our realm."
 EVTOPTA9028:0 "Naturally we shall reward them!"
 EVTOPTB9028:0 "We have nothing to spare at the moment."
 EVTNAME9030:0 "Traveling Monk"
 EVTDESC9030:0 "The heavens have opened themselves and the rain outside falls a rattling tattoo on far off rooftops. A traveling monk has arrived at our doorsteps in $CAPITAL$, asking for food and lodgings. The monk has given a vow of poverty, and by tradition we are obliged to aid him."
 EVTOPTA9030:0 "Naturally we shall aid this traveler!"
 EVTOPTB9030:0 "Off with you, beggar!"
 EVTNAME9032:0 "Visiting a Shrine"
 EVTDESC9032:0 "It has been a long time since last we visited the principal shrines of one of our provinces. The Shrine is located off the beaten track, on top of a mountain said to be the abode of a very powerful kami. Normally we've gone there at least once every year, but it has been a while now. The attendants are expecting us, should we go visit the shrine?"
 EVTOPTA9032:0 "No, not this year. We must work on our Han!"
 EVTOPTB9032:0 "Yes, it is time"
 EVTNAME9034:0 "Cherry Blossom Festival"
 EVTDESC9034:0 "The season of the Cherry Blossoms is upon us! In every province of our Domain our people congregate at shrines and altars to pray, eat and enjoy the beauty of the season. Paper lanterns cast a warm nightly glow over our Han as we go to enjoy the festivities."
 EVTOPTA9034:0 "A proof of our good policies these last years"
 EVTOPTB9034:0 "An omen of good things to come!"
 EVTNAME9036:0 "1000 Koku Tax"
 EVTDESC9036:0 "One of the personal domains under our rulership still owes us outstanding taxes to the tune of 1000 koku of rice. Through communications with our tax collectors, the debtor has argued that his domain is overvalued and that he cannot afford to pay the taxes. We could forgive all or a part of the debt, but we could use the money."
 EVTOPTA9036:0 "We insist that he pay!"
 EVTOPTB9036:0 "We shall forgive part of the debt."
 EVTOPTC9036:0 "Forget the money."
 EVTNAME9038:0 "Death of a Geisha"
 EVTDESC9038:0 "The Geisha is the archetypal, female, Japanese entertainer, and in the last year one of the most well-known and well-liked Geishas in our domain died young after a short time of illness. The funeral has turned into a national day of sorrow as our Han mourns the passing of this beloved example of beauty."
 EVTOPTA9038:0 "We mourn her passing."
 EVTOPTB9038:0 "A dead courtesan? I can't be bothered."
 EVTNAME9040:0 "The Sharpness of The Tanto"
 EVTDESC9040:0 "Disgrace! $MONARCHTITLE$, our Han is in a state of collapse, and the name of our family is quickly becoming a Japanese byword for failure and disgrace. While no one has dared suggest it to your face, the precedents of the ancestors are clear. Either we manage to turn the situation around quickly, or we should consider Seppuku, ritual suicide. The blade of the Tanto gleams sharp and cold on your nightstand."
 EVTOPTA9040:0 "Compose a beautiful death poem."
 EVTOPTB9040:0 "We just need some more time."
 EVTNAME9042:0 "Unruly Daimyo"
 EVTDESC9042:0 "Several local Daimyo swearing fealty to our realm have been conspiring against us for some time. The reason for these conspiracies among our own seems to be that many consider our rule to be illegitimate. The unruly Daimyo demand that we divest more power to them, or face an open rebellion."
 EVTOPTA9042:0 "Accept their demands."
 EVTOPTB9042:0 "Hang them high."
 EVTNAME9044:0 "Koku Reform"
 EVTDESC9044:0 "The wealth of our lands is measured in 'Koku', with one Koku being the volume of rice required to feed one person for a year. While this is fairly easy to measure as such, several of the Provinces within our Domain have been consistently misvalued, since the Koku records have not been updated for several years. The outdated records, used among other things for tax collections, are becoming a source of growing discontent within our realm."
 EVTOPTA9044:0 "Appoint a special commissioner."
 EVTOPTB9044:0 "Order provinces to submit updated records."
 EVTNAME9046:0 "Rangaku Books"
 EVTDESC9046:0 "A European trader trafficking the waters around Japan has landed in our Han and offered to sell us a collection of treatises on western medicine, politics and astronomy. Buying these books would doubtless mean a shift in policy with regard to our Han's openness to trade, and such subversive tomes could destabilize the realm. Not buying the books might be a missed opportunity, but it will on the other hand force us to learn and discover for ourselves."
 EVTOPTA9046:0 "Sold!"
 EVTOPTB9046:0 "Just window-shopping, thank you!"
 EVTNAME9050:0 "Rice Crop Fails"
 EVTDESC9050:0 "The rice planted a few months ago has not come out of the ground, and the rice pads lie dead and dormant. Without rice to harvest, our people, especially the poorest among them, are facing famine and starvation. Amending this failed harvest will cost us, but the alternative might be worse."
 EVTOPTA9050:0 "We have nothing to spare!"
 EVTOPTB9050:0 "We must avert this catastrophe!"
 EVTNAME11000:0 "Eunuch Offers His Service"
 EVTDESC11000:0 "A Eunuch who claims to hail from a northern border province has offered his services to the Imperial Court. The man is clearly of some talent, and can most likely be a boon to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration. However, accepting the aid of this man of statecraft will strengthen the Eunuch faction at court."
 EVTOPTA11000:0 "Of course we are interested!"
 china_events.1.t:0 "Trade Regulations"
 china_events.1.d:0 "It seems the local officials of the Maritime Trade Office in [trade_problems_province.GetName] has taken it upon themselves to stimulate local commerce. A series of regulations issued have, while quite contrary to official policy, managed to provoke a local trade boom, with many local families getting into lucrative business while also attracting foreign merchants from overseas. The Grand Secretary is, however, imploring us to shut them down and retract the local stipulations as they are an affront to good governance and central power."
 china_events.1.a:0 "I am sure the people of [trade_problems_province.GetName] best know how to rule themselves."
 china_events.1.b:0 "We cannot let this slip past us!"
 china_events.2.t:0 "Incident in [port_incident_location.GetName]"
 china_events.2.d:0 "As merchants from every corner of the world seek out the rich ports of the Middle Kingdom it is no wonder that some will at times encounter groups they consider to be their enemies. Local officials are puzzled by a number of of disturbances in [port_incident_location.GetName] that seem related to two such competing groups trying to establish themselves in the same region.\nFearing that the unrest will spread our Commanderies are suggesting that we close down the ports and remove any foreigners in the area. The local offices of Maritime Trade, however, instead recommend that we fine both sides but allow them to continue purchasing our goods."
 china_events.2.a:0 "Fine them but allow them to continue."
 china_events.2.b:0 "Close down the office and expel the foreigners."
 china_events.3.t:0 "The Isolation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 china_events.3.d:0 "By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Emperor and building trust with him at every opportunity, court factions have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers and are increasingly gaining influence over the day to day palatial rulings."
 china_events.3.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is clearly getting good advice."
 china_events.3.b:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes advice from no one!"
 china_events.4.t:0 "A Grand Burial"
 china_events.4.d:0 "A powerful minister at the Imperial Court has died due to old age. The death of this eminence has left a vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill. However, his passing goes beyond petty court politics. It is a profound loss for the empire and we are expected to provide the man with a stately funeral as a token of our appreciation."
 china_events.4.a:0 "The state has no money to spend."
 china_events.4.b:0 "He deserves nothing less than a grand ceremony."
 china_events.5.t:0 "Yellow River Dikes"
 china_events.5.d:0 "Preparing for the seasonal flooding of the Yellow river is one of the oldest and most important duties of any state in Northern China. Our officials have identified an area that has suffered in particular during the last few years. It would blossom if we could only stop the water from threatening the livelihood of the locals."
 china_events.5.a:0 "This will surely please the officials!"
 china_events.5.b:0 "Alas we have no money to spare."
 china_events.6.t:0 "A Gift"
 china_events.6.d:1 "One of our most respected courtiers has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous and carefully constructed countryside manor. Though nothing compared to the Imperial treasury, the gift is quite grand and it is clear to any observer that the doner must be expecting to get something in return..."
 china_events.6.a:0 "We must accept this offering!"
 china_events.6.b:0 "We cannot risk our reputation."
 china_events.7.t:0 "Destitute Banknotes"
 china_events.7.d:1 "As more and more unbacked notes are being issued by the Imperial government our Offices of Trade are fearing that inflation will soon be a growing problem in the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire and in the provinces the people have started talking about this being a sign of us losing the Mandate of Heaven.\nA representative arrived at court today proposing a scheme to reinvigorate the imperial economy by means of a temporary tax combined with reforms to the treasury."
 china_events.7.a:0 "This all sounds very interesting!"

 china_events.7.c:0 "I have trust in the Grand Secretariat."
 china_events.8.t:0 "Quick-Fingered Treasurer"

 china_events.9.d:0 "A young man has excelled at this year's Imperial Examinations. With the highest total score he was not only the optimus of his year, even the examiners have been inspired by the elegant essay in a style will likely set the tone of the examinations for years to come."

 china_events.10.d:0 "An influential proponent of the military at court has harbored a dark secret. For some time, the courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction. Despite flagrant rumors circulating this Eunuch insists that the matter be kept under a lid. He promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."
 china_events.10.a:0 "I suppose we can overlook this."

 china_events.11.t:0 "The Examinations of $YEAR$"
 china_events.11.d:0 "Pupils and Examinees have outperformed themselves and most everyone else at this year's Imperial Examination. The successes at the examinations promises good things for the secretariat, and for the empire at large. In fact it has been suggested that given the excellent results the official quota for how many can pass is on the low side. The Grand Secretary has approached the Emperor asking for a second round of out-takes to allow more of this gifted generation to join the cadres."
 china_events.11.a:0 "Only the best are good enough."
 china_events.11.b:0 "We can certainly use more loyal administrators."
 china_events.12.t:0 "The Southern Elites"
 china_events.12.d:0 "For centuries the southern Empire has been richer and more populous than the north. It is in the south that many of the richest and most influential families have their roots, and it is in the south that the vast majority of the highest scoring in the Imperial Examinations are selected.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that the southern families have an undue influence due to the many southerners in the Palatial administration. In the past quotas have been used to ensure that some part of those who pass the examinations originate from the north. Such quotas would, however, risk to undermine our entire system of merit as the guiding principle."
 china_events.12.a:0 "We need better quotas!"
 china_events.12.b:0 "Northern Literati just don't compare to southerners..."
 china_events.13.t:0 "The [levy_province.GetName] Levy"
 china_events.13.d:0 "Officials have undertaken a project to expand the levy in [levy_province.GetName] by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the Imperial Army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. Confucian administrators, however, would argue that leaving the locals alone would likely increase the value of the province more long term."
 china_events.13.a:0 "Naturally these reforms are called for."
 china_events.13.b:0 "No need to harass the peasantry."
 china_events.14.t:0 "Field Marshal Dishonored"
 china_events.14.d:0 "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for our defenses. He is a disgrace to his family and for himself. This his ill conceived deed has severely hurt the defensive capabilities of the forts in [corrupt_fort.GetName] and [corrupt_fort2.GetName], causing the Empire of China to appear weak."
 china_events.14.a:0 "Execute him!"
 china_events.14.b:0 "Forgive him so that he can help amend this problem."
 china_events.15.t:0 "Heir Lends an Ear"
 china_events.15.d:0 "We have noticed that the heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and officials who are known affiliates of the competing factions at court. There's a great fear that [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to strongly sympathize with political enemies of the imperial throne. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] when he assumes the throne."
 china_events.15.a:1 "[Root.Heir.GetName] should align with the Secretariat."
 china_events.15.b:1 "[Root.Heir.GetName] should align with the Commanderis."

 china_events.16.t:0 "'If people have enough, can the ruler have too little?'"
 china_events.16.d:0 "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has passed through the examination system in one of your provinces. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for examination essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the empire itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."
 china_events.16.a:0 "I sense a great future for this man."

 china_events.18.t:0 "Retainer Flogged"
 china_events.18.d:0 "A high ranking official has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste.

 china_events.20.t:0 "Gold Mine Discovered"

 china_events.23.d:0 "Word has reached us from the frontier provinces of a young general, a brother to [Root.Consort.GetName] who has made a name for himself as an excellent warrior and a great leader. Due to his influence together with that of [Root.Consort.GetName] the [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] family has grown ever more influential at court.\nDespite [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great love for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consort [Root.Monarch.GetName] is growing more and more fearful of the influence of the house of [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName]."

 china_events.24.d:1 "Many would give much to be able to attend our prestigious national schools. To some rich families, this would be a way to ensure that their children acquire the social status that their wealth should entitle them to. It has therefore been the custom to, in times of need, reserve a number of spots at the schools for those that can pay.\nMost will never take advantage of the actual opportunity to study, however, as admission in itself is enough to secure higher social standing."

 EVTOPTA4001:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4001:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4002:0 "Provinces resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4002:0 "Our attempt to westernize is not popular everywhere in $COUNTRY$. Some of the provinces are asking for greater autonomy as a price to accept the changes."
 EVTOPTA4002:0 "Grant autonomy."
 EVTOPTB4002:0 "Slower Westernization."
 EVTNAME4003:0 "Peasants resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4003:0 "The ignorant serfs are getting uppity again, and are creating havoc over our reasonable demands to modernize and become civilized. This is outrageous, but the price to accept their demands may be too high."
 EVTOPTA4003:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4003:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4004:0 "The people resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4004:0 "Our attempts to westernize have met resistance from every strata of society and protesters from all corners of $COUNTRY$ demand we put a stop to this. Failing to do so may jeopardize the standing of the royal family."
 EVTOPTA4004:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4004:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4005:0 "Reactionaries resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4005:0 "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from reactionaries. They are now up in arms over our latest demands which they feel are interfering with their old privileges and traditions."
 EVTOPTA4005:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4005:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4006:0 "Merchants resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4006:0 "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from our traders. Feeling hindered by new trade restrictions they threaten to move elsewhere, taking their trade with them."
 EVTOPTA4006:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4006:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4007:0 "Cultural Establishment resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTA4007:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4007:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4008:0 "Government Officials resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4008:0 "Several government officials have been voicing concerns that our attempts at westernization are going too fast and may drive the country to the brink of ruin. They advise an immediate stop to this or some of them might resign in protest."
 EVTOPTA4008:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4008:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4009:0 "High Command resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTB4009:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4010:0 "Advisers resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTA4010:0 "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4010:0 "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME9610:0 "Decline of Renaissance"
 EVTDESC9610:0 "The growth that our country has seen lately seems to have diverted much of both our resources and attention. The educational reforms and artistic development we were once known for have suffered accordingly, and we can no longer claim to be a leading nation when it comes to embracing the renaissance philosophy."
 EVTOPTA9610:0 "Very unfortunate."
 EVTNAME750:0 "Bad Reputation!"
 EVTDESC750:0 "Our recent strategy to carve new provinces out of whoever happens to be in the way surprisingly seems to have had a somewhat negative effect on our standing among our fellow nations."
 EVTOPTA750:0 "They are overreacting as always!"
 EVTNAME751:0 "Inflation"
 EVTDESC751:0 "The state of constant war has eroded our economy and now inflation is spiraling out of control!"
 EVTOPTA751:0 "Try minting more coins!"
 EVTNAME752:0 "Officers Deserting"
 EVTDESC752:0 "Disillusioned by the repeated and seemingly aimless wars of $MONARCH$, many officers in the army have deserted to seek better assignments elsewhere."
 EVTOPTA752:0 "Bah, I'll lead the army myself!"
 EVTNAME753:0 "Merchants Resented"
 EVTOPTA753:0 "Then I'll conquer them too!"
 EVTNAME754:0 "Legitimacy Questioned"
 EVTDESC754:0 "The bloodthirst shown by $MONARCH$ has ruined the reputation of $COUNTRY$ in the eyes of the world, and now our own subjects are starting to question the legitimacy of such a ruthless ruler."
 EVTOPTA754:0 "Tell my heir to start worrying..."
 EVTNAME755:0 "Magistrates Resigns"
 EVTDESC755:0 "Magistrates are the very sinews of a country, and unfortunately all ours are resigning!\n\n They claim this to be a protest to the burden of never-ending wars that has been laid upon them."
 EVTOPTA755:0 "I can do whatever they did myself!"
 EVTNAME756:0 "Advisor Resigns"
 EVTDESC756:0 "Horrified by our conquest-bent foreign policy, a leading court adviser has resigned and left the country!"
 EVTOPTA756:0 "Typical naysayer... Good riddance!"
 EVTNAME757:0 "$PROVINCENAME$ Revolts!"
 EVTDESC757:1 "The loyal subjects of $COUNTRY$ have long carried the enormous burden of the [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s constant wars without complaint. Those days are now over...\n\nSince [Root.Owner.GetRulerOrRegency] doesn't seem to listen to reason, the people of $PROVINCENAME$ have decided to try saber rattling!"
 EVTOPTA757:0 "That I hear..."
 EVTNAME758:0 "We have been chosen!"
 EVTDESC758:0 "Good news, my $MONARCHTITLE$! The Emperor has bestowed the great honor of hosting this year's assembly of the Reichstag upon us.\n\nThis will greatly increase our prestige in the empire. May all delegates gasp in awe as they enter our glorious capital $PROVINCECAPITAL$!"
 EVTOPTA758:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTNAME773:0 "Merchants Assassinated!"
 EVTOPTA773:0 "Heads will roll! Hopefully not mine..."
 EVTNAME759:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC759:2 "Since the tenth century the Archbishops of Mainz have held the prestigious title of §YPrimas Germaniae§! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire... We must take heed and not let our prestige drop too low, or we might find the title slip from our fingers!"
 EVTOPTA759:0 "I see..."
 EVTNAME760:1 "Title of Primas Germaniae Questioned"
 EVTDESC760:0 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, much of the Catholic community seem to have lost their faith in us! There are even rumors that another Archbishopric plans to claim our title as Primas Germaniae!"
 EVTOPTA760:0 "Probably just rumors."
 EVTNAME761:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC761:1 "The title of §WPrimas Germaniae§! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - was created in the tenth century when the Archbishopric of Mainz became the first Archbishopric to receive it.\n\nFor the second-rate power of $FROM$ to hold such a prestigious title seems an affront to the Catholic Church. Perhaps a more worthy candidate can be found?"
 EVTOPTA761:0 "Perhaps... me?"
 EVTOPTB761:0 "Leave it be. For now..."
 EVTOPTC761:0 "A better one could not be found."
 EVTNAME762:0 "Primas Germaniae Lost"
 EVTDESC762:2 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, we have lost the prestigious title of §WPrimas Germaniae§!. Due to our low standing in the empire of late, another Archbishop has gone ahead and claimed the title!"
 EVTOPTA762:0 "Very well, congratulate him..."
 EVTOPTB762:0 "We will not forget this!"
 EVTNAME763:0 "Legatus Natus"
 EVTDESC763:0 "We have long been honored with being the Pope's representative - §WLegatus Natus§! - north of the Alps.\n\nSuch a prestigious title demands a certain level of dignity and we cannot let our prestige or our relations with the Pope drop too low."
 EVTOPTA763:0 "It's all in God's hands."
 EVTNAME764:0 "Title of Legatus Natus Lost"
 EVTDESC764:0 "Our standings in the Empire and with the Pope have declined lately. The Pope no longer seems to have confidence in us upholding our role as his delegate in the empire and has most unfortunately decided to relieve us of the title."
 EVTOPTA764:0 "I guess it was in my hands after all..."
 EVTNAME765:0 "Envoy from the Pope"
 EVTDESC765:0 "Good news! We have been selected by the Pope to hold the prestigious title of §WLegatus Natus§! - his representative north of the Alps - after the former holder fell from grace."
 EVTOPTA765:0 "Is that a crepuscular ray shining in?"
 EVTOPTB765:0 "We must graciously decline."
 EVTDESC6197:0 "Our policy of supporting and expanding the bureaucracy of our nation is really paying off. Every day new officials are trained and set off to glorious new careers in our administration!"
 EVTOPTA6197:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTDESC6198:0 "An empire of this size needs a lot of bureaucrats, perhaps offering a sign up bonus will encourage their numbers to grow?"
 EVTOPTA6198:0 "Whatever it takes."
 EVTOPTB6198:0 "Not right now."
 EVTNAME2036:0 "Religious Turmoil"
 EVTDESC2036:0 "Reports have reached us that the Emperor is planning to march against all Protestant states in the Empire. He is determined to cleanse the Holy Roman lands of all heretics before the end of the year. If we are to stay true to our faith, we'll have to make preparations."
 EVTOPTA2036:0 "Proclaim religious independence."
 EVTOPTB2036:0 "Our allegiance lies with the Emperor."
 EVTNAME6100:0 "Popular Support for our Grand Navy"
 EVTDESC6100:0 "Across the land people are supporting our Grand Navy, making contributions towards the defense of our nation. In the shipyards our shipwrights are working ever harder, and people are even volunteering to become sailors! People take pride in our great Navy."
 EVTOPTA6100:0 "That's just fantastic."
 EVTNAME6101:0 "Popular Enthusiasm for our Navy diminishes"
 EVTDESC6101:0 "To be honest our people do not feel that our Navy is so grand anymore, in fact they just plain don't like it. Press gangs are finding it even harder than usual and even acquiring basic materials is a struggle."
 EVTOPTA6101:0 "This is only a short term problem."
 EVTOPTB6101:0 "This is nothing a little money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6102:0 "Promising Admiral Appears"
 EVTDESC6102:0 "One of our Seahawks has turned out to be much better than we first expected."
 EVTOPTA6102:0 "I knew this was a good idea."
 EVTNAME6103:0 "Aristocrats concerned"
 EVTDESC6103:0 "Our policy of appointing promising commanders regardless of birth is upsetting our aristocrats who find it hard to dine with men who lack breeding. According to our aristocrats it is also upsetting the men under their command, who expect to be led by their betters rather than by someone who is plainly not a gentleman."
 EVTOPTA6103:0 "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6103:0 "Well, we can make a few concessions."
 EVTNAME6104:0 "Naval Developments"
 EVTDESC6104:1 "Our use of superior seamanship is leading to huge developments in naval thought, which will benefit our fleet for many years to come."
 EVTOPTA6104:0 "This just can't be bad."
 EVTNAME6105:0 "Naval Hubris"
 EVTDESC6105:1 "Our seamanship is so superior that to be honest complacency is setting in. People are content to rest on their laurels, but this could make us vulnerable to challenges by would-be upstarts."
 EVTOPTA6105:0 "Our Navy is the best."
 EVTOPTB6105:0 "We must shake them up a little."
 EVTNAME6106:0 "Improved Blockade Tactics"
 EVTDESC6106:0 "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to develop much improved blockade tactics. Although our enemies will eventually counter them, for the moment we will really be able to turn the screw."
 EVTOPTA6106:0 "We might even make some money out of this."
 EVTNAME6107:0 "Slipping Standards"
 EVTDESC6107:0 "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to put up fearsome blockades of enemy coasts, but at the moment our sailors are just getting a bit lazy."
 EVTOPTA6107:0 "Well we can't expect them to operate at peak efficiency all the time."
 EVTOPTB6107:0 "I expect every man to do his duty no matter what."
 EVTNAME6108:0 "Naval Technical Developments"
 EVTDESC6108:0 "Our shipwrights are already excellent, but they are currently undergoing a burst of creativity that is leading to newer technical developments."
 EVTOPTA6108:0 "Who am I to stop them?"
 EVTNAME6109:0 "Concerned Shipwrights"
 EVTDESC6109:1 "For reasons we cannot fathom our shipwrights feel that they are not getting the backing and support from the naval establishment. However, ruling a nation is a lot of work, do we really care about such a minor matter?"
 EVTOPTA6109:0 "Why should I care about people who are so poor they have to work?"
 EVTOPTB6109:0 "Time to upset the Naval Establishment."
 EVTNAME6110:0 "We Rule the Waves"
 EVTDESC6110:0 "Our glorious navy is the pride of our nation and the envy of the world."
 EVTOPTA6110:0 "More Glory for us."
 EVTNAME6111:0 "The Fleet has Declined"
 EVTDESC6111:0 "No one can quite understand it. One minute we had a glorious navy that the whole nation took pride in. Now the world laughs at our fleet."
 EVTOPTA6111:0 "The glory days will return."
 EVTOPTB6111:0 "A little money might sort things out."
 EVTNAME6112:0 "Recruits flock to the standards"
 EVTDESC6112:0 "Our system of national conscripts is proving very successful, the poor, the desperate, even the patriotic are flocking to the colors. The Generals are pleased."
 EVTOPTA6112:0 "Let's get them into the army now."
 EVTOPTB6112:0 "No, we must think long term here."
 EVTNAME6113:0 "People don't want to be conscripted"
 EVTDESC6113:0 "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113:0 "Well I am sure we can slow down recruitment in the short term"
 EVTOPTB6113:0 "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners."
 EVTNAME6114:0 "Isn't our Army Grand?"
 EVTDESC6114:0 "Our Grand Army is so grand that it is marching from one victory to another. Experience from those victories positively impacts recruitment and training of new soldiers."
 EVTOPTA6114:0 "This is fantastic."
 EVTNAME6115:0 "Our Army is not so Grand"
 EVTDESC6115:0 "One minute our army is the envy of the world, next no one has anything good to say about it. We have no idea how our grand army slipped so, but it could end up affecting recruitment."
 EVTOPTA6115:0 "Looks like recruitment will be a little harder."
 EVTOPTB6115:0 "Time to shake up the military establishment!"
 EVTNAME6116:0 "Military Improvements"
 EVTDESC6116:0 "Our officers are experimenting with new ways to drill our already superbly drilled army. This seems to be raising the overall level of military thought in our nation."
 EVTOPTA6116:0 "I like military thinkers!"
 EVTNAME6117:0 "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117:1 "Our superbly drilled army is in the opinion of our most influential generals invincible. Any recent setbacks are down to the weather or the enemy using such unmanly things as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned there is no way to improve on perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117:0 "Invincible, I like the sound of it..."
 EVTOPTB6117:0 "I think the truth may upset some people."
 EVTNAME6118:0 "Fortification Effort"
 EVTDESC6118:0 "Our Engineering Corps is currently short of things to do, however, they have found a province without any fortifications and have taken upon themselves to sort this out."
 EVTOPTA6118:0 "That is very nice of them."
 EVTNAME6119:0 "Fortification Enhancement"
 EVTDESC6119:0 "Our Engineering Corps has found a minor fortification that could do with some improvements."
 EVTOPTA6119:0 "We must always seek improvements wherever possible."
 EVTNAME6120:0 "Our Engineers are busy"
 EVTDESC6120:0 "Our Engineer Corps is always finding ways to keep themselves occupied. Today they upgraded a fortification in one of our provinces."
 EVTOPTA6120:0 "We are pleased."
 EVTNAME6121:0 "Fortification works"
 EVTDESC6121:0 "Our Engineers have enhanced a fortification making it a substantial barrier to enemy forces."
 EVTOPTA6121:0 "Let's hope someone tries to siege it"
 EVTNAME6122:0 "Epic Fortification built"
 EVTDESC6122:0 "An already substantial fortification has been enhanced by our engineers, although some of our generals feel that our troops are wasted cowering behind forts."
 EVTOPTA6122:0 "One mustn't grumble."
 EVTNAME6123:0 "New Bastions built"
 EVTDESC6123:0 "Just when it seemed that our fortifications couldn't get any better. One of our engineers came up with this great idea of triangular bastions. Not only do they look great, they also seem to slow down the enemy."
 EVTOPTA6123:0 "I guess I shouldn't complain."
 EVTNAME6124:0 "Fort falls into disrepair"
 EVTDESC6124:0 "A minor fortification has been neglected by our engineers and has fallen into disrepair. To be honest, at the moment it probably wouldn't even delay a party of school children, never mind an invading army."
 EVTOPTA6124:0 "Real men don't hide behind forts!"
 EVTOPTB6124:0 "Perhaps some repairs are in order..."
 EVTNAME6125:0 "Fort decays"
 EVTDESC6125:0 "Our Engineers have sadly neglected the condition of this fortification, unless an action is taken the fort will only offer minimal protection."
 EVTOPTA6125:0 "It isn't important..."
 EVTOPTB6125:0 "There's nothing money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6126:0 "Fort Crumbles"
 EVTDESC6126:0 "A recent audit has revealed that the walls of one of our fortifications is crumbling, while our engineering corps claims that there isn't enough money for repairs. If nothing is done its defensive ability will be reduced, however, on the long term basis it might become a major tourist attraction in a few hundred years time, boosting the local economy."
 EVTOPTA6126:0 "Let's go for long term gain."
 EVTOPTB6126:0 "I think a more short term approach is in order."
 EVTNAME6127:0 "Fort Weakens"
 EVTDESC6127:0 "Poor maintenance work by Engineer Corps has left one of our more substantial fortifications with serious structural damage. For this fort to remain up to spec major structural work will be required."
 EVTOPTA6127:0 "Just punish a few of the people responsible."
 EVTOPTB6127:0 "No, let's spend the money."
 EVTNAME6128:0 "Complacent Engineers"
 EVTDESC6128:0 "It has been discovered that one of our largest fortifications is no longer up to the job after a bout of complacency in our engineer corps."
 EVTOPTA6128:0 "If the experts are getting complacent I am sure things must be fine."
 EVTOPTB6128:0 "Action must be taken."
 EVTNAME6129:0 "Fortification Crisis"
 EVTDESC6129:0 "Neglect by our Engineer Corps has left one of our most powerful and modern fortification with a weakened wall. A besieging army may be able to exploit this."
 EVTOPTA6129:0 "The experts have spoken."
 EVTOPTB6129:0 "No! We will do something immediately."
 EVTNAME6130:0 "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions has been very successful, a new general has emerged."
 EVTOPTA6130:0 "Well, he shows promise."
 EVTNAME6131:0 "Nobility Concerned with the Loss of Privileges"
 EVTDESC6131:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131:0 "Does the nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131:0 "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better."
 EVTNAME6132:0 "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132:0 "Our Glorious Army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132:0 "Glory to us!"
 EVTNAME6133:0 "Our Army has seen Better Days"
 EVTDESC6133:1 "The varnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just aren't taking our army as seriously as before."
 EVTOPTA6133:0 "Time to shake things up then!"
 EVTOPTB6133:0 "I don't think there is much that can be done..."
 EVTNAME6134:0 "Adventurous Merchants"
 EVTDESC6134:0 "Current trading conditions are strongly favoring our merchants. Our merchants are ready to take advantage of these."
 EVTOPTA6134:0 "Excellent."
 EVTNAME6135:0 "Our Merchants are doing Poorly"
 EVTDESC6135:0 "Although previously our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135:0 "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts!"
 EVTOPTB6135:0 "A few unpopular reforms are the answer."
 EVTNAME6136:0 "Colonist Rush"
 EVTDESC6136:0 "Rumors of our Quest for the New World have led to more people readying themselves for a new life as a colonial settler."
 EVTOPTA6136:0 "They might be useful."
 EVTNAME6137:0 "People Flee to the Colonies"
 EVTDESC6137:0 "Our Quest for the New World has opened up opportunities for people in our colonies. The continuing war has convinced many of the best and brightest that the time to take these opportunities is now."
 EVTOPTA6137:0 "Let them go."
 EVTOPTB6137:0 "They must be stopped."
 EVTNAME6138:1 "The [empty_neighbor_target.GetAreaName] Company"
 EVTDESC6138:1 "The [This.GetAreaName] Company that was charged with the duty of claiming [This.GetName] in the name of [This.Owner.GetName] has decided instead to expand its borders to an adjacent region close to our colony. The promise of a new life in this uninhabited land is greatly appealing to the [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] settlers, and should we permit the expansion, it will attract a far greater number of settlers than our existing colony in [This.GetName]."
 colonial.1.d:0 "Our nation is surrounded by territories as yet unclaimed by any of our rivals. Our ambition to expand the lands belonging to the crown has spread into nationalistic fervor within our people, and a new private company has established itself in [Root.GetName] with the ambition of bringing new settlers to the lands of [empty_neighbor_target.GetName] to claim the territory for Glory, Gold, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], and the [empty_neighbor_target.GetAreaName] Company. Should we permit the expansion, they will bring a great deal of settlers to the province and rapidly expand [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] influence in the area."
 EVTOPTA6138:0 "This can only be good."
 colonial.1.c:0 "Use their fervor to excite a baby boom in [Root.GetName] instead."
 EVTNAME6139:0 "Colonial Company goes Bankrupt"
 EVTDESC6139:0 "One of colonial ventures has run into serious financial trouble, if no action is taken the colonists could suffer."
 EVTOPTA6139:0 "They knew the risks, it's not my problem."
 EVTOPTB6139:0 "Time for us to step in."
 EVTOPTA6140:0 "Excellent news."
 EVTNAME6141:0 "Trade Complacency"
 EVTDESC6141:0 "Although as a nation we are famous for our shrewd commerce practices, at the moment our merchants are becoming a tad complacent."
 EVTOPTA6141:0 "I can see our merchants not competing as well."
 EVTOPTB6141:0 "I think prices could be rising."
 EVTNAME6142:0 "Excellent Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6142:0 "Every so often a country is blessed with honest men working hard for the state. A number of good viceroys across our overseas holdings are giving us a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6142:0 "We are pleased to hear this."
 EVTNAME6143:0 "Corrupt Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6143:0 "Overseas provinces are notoriously too hard to police and good viceroys are essential. Sometimes though things don't work according to the plan, and corrupt and venal men end up in charge."
 EVTOPTA6143:0 "Take action."
 EVTOPTB6143:0 "Just turn a blind eye."
 EVTNAME6144:0 "Production Improvements"
 EVTDESC6144:0 "Our embracing of Smithian Economics has led to people spending time thinking about how things are produced. For the moment it seems to have paid off."
 EVTOPTA6144:0 "This is good."
 EVTNAME6145:0 "Production Stifled"
 EVTDESC6145:0 "Our producers become complacent as our use of Smithian Economics led to our production techniques being so advanced."
 EVTOPTA6145:0 "I think this will hurt production."
 EVTOPTB6145:0 "Actually it seems to have translated into higher prices."
 EVTNAME6146:0 "Successful Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6146:0 "On an annual basis bureaucracy gives the country a nice little tax boost, but sometimes the right men in the right place can give the country that little bit extra. It is a shame that a few years down the line you have to promote them beyond their ability."
 EVTOPTA6146:0 "Make hay while the sun shines."
 EVTNAME6147:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6147:0 "Bureaucracy sometimes just doesn't work. The wrong men in the wrong places can lead to corrupt practices which hurt the country's income. Even worse, it will take a few years to get the proper paperwork to change it."
 EVTOPTA6147:0 "You just can't fight the system."
 EVTNAME6148:0 "National Bank pays dividends"
 EVTDESC6148:0 "Several shrewd loans have led to very good profits at our National Bank. The bank is hiking its dividend and buying back some of its shares."
 EVTOPTA6148:0 "We're in the money."
 EVTNAME6149:0 "National Bank in Trouble"
 EVTDESC6149:0 "Our National Bank is doing very poorly. It is finding it hard to lend to reliable people and is running into difficulties."
 EVTOPTA6149:0 "We'll give it some money to support it!"
 EVTOPTB6149:0 "Tell the bank to lend to slightly less reliable people."
 EVTNAME6150:0 "Trade Policy Success"
 EVTDESC6150:0 "Our National Trade Policy is proving unusually successful at the moment. This is giving our merchants a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6150:0 "I am sure this is good news."
 EVTNAME6151:0 "Trade Policy is Failing"
 EVTDESC6151:0 "Our National Trade Policy isn't really delivering at the moment. Our merchant just aren't doing as well."
 EVTOPTA6151:0 "Looks like the merchants are struggling."
 EVTOPTB6151:0 "We should grease the wheels a little more..."
 EVTNAME6152:0 "New Spy Techniques"
 EVTDESC6152:0 "Our Espionage system is performing and our agents have found new ways to spy on people. Sooner or later our 'friends' and enemies will find out, but for the moment we have an edge."
 EVTOPTA6152:0 "I like edges."
 EVTNAME6153:0 "Spy Defections"
 EVTDESC6153:0 "Some of the spies in our espionage system are defecting to other countries. This could hurt us in the short term."
 EVTOPTA6153:0 "Let the disloyal elements go."
 EVTOPTB6153:0 "A small cash sum might change a few minds."
 EVTNAME6154:0 "Cabinet Dynamism"
 EVTDESC6154:0 "A combination of just the correct people in our cabinet can create conditions for a nice little boost in tax income. You will be pleased to hear that this has just happened."

 EVTOPTA6156:0 "Good to see."
 EVTNAME6157:0 "Backlash"
 EVTDESC6157:0 "Since we introduced the Bill of Rights many of our original ruling classes have been feeling marginalized, however, rather than discuss it they seem to be staging a revolt."
 EVTOPTA6157:0 "Why don't they just discuss this like gentlemen?"
 EVTNAME6158:0 "The Clergy Mobilizes Population"
 EVTDESC6158:1 "For many years our policies have motivated a large majority of our population to dutifully attend the expected religious ceremonies. The clergy has shown its thanks for our supportive policy by in turn making supportive comments about our government."
 EVTOPTA6158:0 "May our people always find unity through faith."
 EVTNAME6159:0 "Religious Divergences"
 EVTDESC6159:0 "We are in many ways seen as one of the foremost defenders of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Our religious institutions are strong and priests both here and abroad flock to our seminars.\nIt is therefore somewhat embarrassing that the rural population in our country isn't quite as in tune with the theology as we are. Reports of deviations such as a dog being proclaimed a saint or old heathen festivals being integrated with the holy ceremonies of our faith is undermining our state."
 EVTOPTA6159:0 "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6159:0 "Attempt to make them abandon their ways."

 EVTNAME6161:0 "Conservative Backlash"

 EVTNAME6163:0 "His Holiness is Concerned"

 EVTNAME6164:0 "His Holiness is Outraged"
 EVTDESC6164:0 "Taking advantage of our tolerant society, people have decided to embrace the Reformed Faith. The Papal nuncio has already expressed to us the concern of the Church."

 EVTNAME6165:0 "His Holiness is Shocked"
 EVTDESC6165:0 "As we are an enlightened and tolerant society, some of our citizens have decided that the Catholic faith does not fit in with their current lifestyle choice and have decided instead to embrace Protestantism."

 EVTNAME6167:0 "The Patriarch is complaining"
 EVTDESC6167:0 "The Patriarch is concerned that we are showing too much tolerance when the news came the followers of Luther expanded their heretic beliefs in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6167:0 "These things happen."
 EVTNAME6168:0 "The Patriarch is concerned"
 EVTDESC6168:0 "The news has reached us today that Calvinism has spread in our realm. It seems that people are taking advantage of our tolerance to try out strange new faiths."

 EVTDESC6172:0 "Church elders believe that, as God has ordained, that our tolerant policies should be punished with our people converting to Catholicism, the apocalypse is surely just round the corner."

 EVTNAME6173:0 "God Punishing us?"
 EVTDESC6173:0 "Church Elders are of the opinion that our Merciful Lord is punishing us for the sinful policy of humanist tolerance. Certainly the Orthodox faith is advancing in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6173:0 "Would God really do that?"
 EVTNAME6174:0 "Church Elders concerned"
 EVTDESC6174:0 "Senior Elders in our church have expressed the opinion that the recent mass conversion to Protestantism was yet another sign of our Lord's divine wrath. Slightly more skeptical government officials think that our policy of tolerance may be a more likely cause."
 EVTOPTA6174:0 "I guess you reap what you sow."
 EVTNAME6175:0 "Ulema Concerned"
 EVTDESC6175:0 "The Ulema are increasingly concerned that we are being too tolerant to the schismatic followers of Ali. They feel that Allah the compassionate, the merciful, will be angered by this. Regardless, their faith is advancing in our country."

 EVTNAME6176:0 "Ayatollahs are concerned"

 EVTNAME6177:0 "Monks concerned"
 EVTDESC6177:0 "A delegation of senior Monks, after several days of meditation, have come to suggest that our tolerant policy is affecting the enlightenment of our realm. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Hindu faith."
 EVTOPTA6177:0 "This could harm some of our people's Karma."
 EVTNAME6178:0 "People turn to Philosophy!"
 EVTDESC6178:0 "In a move that could rock the Karma of the whole nation, some of our people have decided to turn their back on the teachings of the Lord Buddha and instead embrace the teachings of a Chinese philosopher. Senior Monks believe that our policy of tolerance is the cause of this."
 EVTOPTA6178:0 "If only the Lord Buddha allowed us to be a bit more intolerant."
 EVTNAME6179:0 "The People turn to spirit worship"
 EVTDESC6179:0 "Our People have taken advantage of our policy of tolerance to embrace the spirit worship of Shintoism. Many monks are concerned."

 EVTNAME6180:0 "People turn their back on Brahman"
 EVTDESC6180:0 "Our People have started to turn their back on traditional forms of worship, to follow the teaching of that new thinker Buddha. Priests blame our policy of tolerance."

 EVTNAME6181:0 "People turn to philosophy"
 EVTDESC6181:0 "Shockingly to the religious establishment, due to our tolerant policies people are turning to the Chinese philosophy of Confucianism. The Thuggees have already announced there will be unspecified action taken."
 EVTOPTA6181:0 "It is not that surprising really..."
 EVTNAME6182:0 "Gurus complain!"
 EVTDESC6182:0 "A number of important Gurus are expressing their concern at our policy of Tolerance. It seems a new form of spirit worship has been spreading in our country."

 EVTNAME6183:0 "People turn to Buddhism"

 EVTOPTA6183:0 "We live in Interesting times."
 EVTNAME6184:0 "People start worshiping Hinduism"
 EVTDESC6184:0 "With our tolerance of other faiths people have decided to embrace Hinduism.

Lead through virtue, discipline through the rites, and there will be a sense of shame and conscientious improvements.'"
 EVTOPTA6184:0 "These things do happen."
 EVTNAME6185:0 "Our People embrace Shintoism"
 EVTDESC6185:0 "Our Humanist Tolerance has led some of our people to become Shintoists. Confucius says 'If a man is without benevolences, then of what use are the rights? If a man is without benevolences, then of what use is music?'."

 EVTNAME6186:0 "Our Priests express mild displeasure"

 EVTNAME9557:0 "Offense or Defense"

 EVTOPTA9559:0 "That's not possible"
 EVTOPTB9559:0 "That's the only reasonable explanation"
 EVTNAME9560:0 "A Traitor in the Parliament"
 EVTDESC9560:0 "It would appear as though a member of our parliament has been selling secrets to our enemies. How would you otherwise explain the fact that they all of a sudden seem able to predict our every move? These were decisions that were never discussed outside the Parliament building."
 EVTOPTA9560:0 "Of course it was one of them"
 EVTOPTB9560:0 "It's better to play it safe until we know more"
 EVTNAME9561:0 "Political Chaos"
 EVTDESC9561:0 "Our Parliament's indecisiveness and inability to make any kind of decision has created near chaos. Every member is trying their utmost to get their voice heard but refusing to acknowledge the opinions of anyone else."

 EVTNAME9563:0 "Financial Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9563:0 "Our economy isn't what it has been.

 EVTOPTB9563:0 "Raise taxes"
 EVTNAME9564:0 "Military Spending"

 EVTOPTB9564:0 "Cut back on military expenses"
 EVTNAME9565:0 "A Strong Army or Navy?"
 EVTDESC9565:0 "Our Parliament is divided in regards to our military focus, some of them are advocating for a grand navy while others are more interested in a large army. Although some sort of middle way would be possible, most of them would prefer that we increased the size of our navy."
 EVTOPTA9565:0 "A large navy is the only option"
 EVTOPTB9565:0 "A large army would be more beneficial"
 EVTNAME9566:0 "Military Leniency"
 EVTDESC9566:0 "Some members of our parliament feel that we are too lenient when it comes to asserting control over what is rightfully ours. They can't understand how we can allow a core province like $PROVINCENAME$ to be controlled by some other country and just sit idly by."
 EVTOPTA9566:0 "They fail to see the bigger picture"
 EVTOPTB9566:0 "It's not of any interest anymore"

 EVTNAME9568:0 "Economic Decisions"
 EVTDESC9568:0 "Our parliament is constantly exploring different ways to bring more money into our state treasury but as always there are disagreements regarding the best strategy. A heavy tax raise would improve the state of our treasury considerably but it is also very likely to upset the populace, a small raise on the other hand wouldn't improve our finances as much but wouldn't cause that many protests either."
 EVTOPTA9568:0 "A short-term solution is probably the best option"
 EVTOPTB9568:0 "Consider the long-term consequences"
 EVTNAME9569:0 "Military Expenses"

 EVTNAME9570:0 "Sympathizers of the Old Government"
 EVTDESC9570:0 "It would appear as though a few members of our parliament still sympathize with the former government. Neither of them will admit it of course, but their behavior is rather suspicious at times. It might be a good idea to investigate where their real allegiances lay."
 EVTOPTA9570:0 "That won't be necessary"
 EVTOPTB9570:0 "Get to it"
 EVTNAME9571:0 "A New Constitution"
 EVTDESC9571:0 "Despite the considerable time and effort dedicated to the establishment of a new constitution, our parliament can't seem to agree on a common goal. So far, not a single proposition has been accepted by all parties and all normal activities have come to a standstill."
 EVTOPTA9571:0 "It will be solved soon enough"
 EVTOPTB9571:0 "Request some help"
 EVTNAME9572:0 "Areas of Research"
 EVTDESC9572:0 "Every member of our parliament is requesting more money to be invested in a different area. Our army needs funding but so does our trade and production and let's not forget about our navy."
 EVTOPTA9572:0 "An even spread should do the trick"
 EVTOPTB9572:0 "There's no need for any extra investments"
 EVTNAME9573:0 "Lack of Support"
 EVTDESC9573:0 "Some members of our parliament seem to think that $MONARCH$ has held his office long enough and are arguing for a new election.

 EVTOPTA9573:0 "Ignore them"

 EVTNAME9575:0 "Troublesome Parliament"

It made you sick. Sick to the core. Killing your progeny wasn't the catharsis you had expected it to be. For an instant, the flashing glimpse of an insight blows across your mind..."

They seem so... right. You have gone quite insane."

'...which is why it is of vital importance that...' - Don't they ever stop? 'In nature', you find yourself saying in interruption, 'the first step, leading an animal into the grave, is always procreation.'
