As lifelong soldiers they have families and businesses at home that they attend in peacetime and long wars make it hard for them to maintain this life. A delegation of Streltsy soldiers arrived today in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] asking to be allowed to return to their homes or to be compensated with higher pay."

Many of our Streltsy have settled in or around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and lead normal lives as shopkeepers, craftsmen or other less martial occupations on the side. While they do get a certain salary for being at our disposal this is by no means enough to support a family and the state has often tolerated and even encouraged the soldiers to have alternate means of income.\nSome fear, however, that our Streltsy are forgetting what it is to be a soldier, and that they lack interest in keeping their equipment up to date or in good shape."

 streltsy_events.5.d:0 "A Strelets is offered a plot of land and the promise of a salary in exchange for a lifelong service to the state. Often his position will then be inherited by his son and so the state is assured well armed and motivated soldiers for long times to come. All over our country this type of employment has made men seek our service, and while not everyone can join in offensive warfare, many make a welcome addition to the garrisons of our border fortresses."

While we are united in faith the people of the state, including many of the local priests, are refusing to participate in the feasts and celebrations of saints that are customary within our borders.

He claims that the sect is denouncing the Trinity, the divinity of Christ and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Metropolitan has asked us to help him in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread among high as well as low.\nThe case seems very clear. Except it seems the sect has some supporters even in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Can we really afford to lose the support of these men and women and are they really as heretic as the Metropolitan claims?"

The Estates of a local monastery in [monastic_province.GetCapitalName] have in fact grown so big and are so well kept that they have become the envy of our local administrator. The governor has become entangled in a conflict with the Monks over where exactly the demarcation between their lands and those of the [Root.GovernmentName] goes.\nThe time has come for central authorities to step in and settle the dispute. Helping the monastery would undoubtedly secure their gratitude, but this could also be an opportunity to get hold of more land for the state..."
