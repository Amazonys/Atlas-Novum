 personality_events.1.t:0 "The many Interests of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 personality_events.1.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has grown increasingly interested with the higher intellectual pursuits and can spend days talking to the learned men of our court. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has started inviting scholars from near and far to help [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] better understand how the world and the people in it functions.\nThe way things are developing [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] could probably become an authority in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own right if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could spend enough time and resources on the areas of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] choice."
 personality_events.1.a:0 "We must strive to understand the physical world around us."
 personality_events.1.a.tt:0 "Our ruler will be free to spend time and the resources of our state in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pursuit of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great interests in life.\nOnly time will tell if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will make a name for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in a scholarly discipline."
 personality_events.1.b:0 "A ruler must understand the laws of god and men."
 personality_events.1.c:0 "Let us not waste [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time and money with such matters."
 personality_events.2.t:0 "Advances in Cartography"
 personality_events.2.d:0 "A devoted student of the world around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to be obsessed with maps. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] palace in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] has rooms entirely devoted to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] map collection and our dear [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is spending quite some time staring at them and cataloging them.\nWhile this has made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a bit odd in the eyes of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] courtiers (and the royal treasurer) our country is benefiting from the great archive [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has built up about the world around us."
 personality_events.2.a:0 "The world is such a big place."
 personality_events.3.t:0 "Advances in Gunsmithing"
 personality_events.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken a great interest in the function and form of guns. Considerable effort has been spent tracking down unusual or innovative firearms and [Root.Monarch.GetName] will gleefully disassemble and rebuild any weapon brought to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\nSome would consider this fascination morbid (not to mention expensive) but as the result of this long standing project our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has created what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] claims is the perfect firearm."

 personality_events.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been absorbed by the possibility of creating gold ever since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] early childhood and with the government coffers open to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] this has grown into an obsession. Every book and supposed expert has been gathered to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be examined or questioned. [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has spent many days in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] laboratory but has so far not come close to creating this expensive metal.\nSome would call this pursuit a fool's errand but it has certainly improved our knowledge about Chemistry."

 personality_events.4.b:0 "Must... Create Gold..."
 personality_events.4.b.tt:0 "Give our monarch free reins to pursue [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goals in alchemy. Chances of success are very uncertain."
 personality_events.5.t:0 "Pursuit of a Hobby"
 personality_events.5.d:0 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken a great interest in all kinds of intellectual pursuits throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign it seems [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ambition to make a name for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] among the scholars of the world hasn't been very successful. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] patronage of greater intellects is not without merit for [Root.GetName] as a whole even if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] failed ambition remains a sore point to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 personality_events.5.a:0 "'Dicebat nos esse quasi nanos, gigantium humeris insidentes.'"
 personality_events.5.b:0 "I will surround myself with the great minds of our age!"

 personality_events.7.d:0 "In order to fully understand what rules govern a land and its inhabitants [Root.Monarch.GetName] has immersed [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the great works of theology and philosophy. A great number of scholars have also been brought to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to give their view on the order of things in the world.\nThis pursuit of guidance has now culminated in a great debate hosted by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 personality_events.7.a:0 "What a great day for learning!"
 personality_events.7.b:0 "We must look further for answers."
 personality_events.8.t:0 "What is Right in War and Peace"
 personality_events.8.d:0 "In [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pursuit of justice [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to interest [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the relations between great states. The conduct of states while at war, at sea or otherwise far from home is governed by few laws but many traditions. Determined to shape the international debate on these matters [Root.Monarch.GetName] has drawn from all material [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been able to find to write a book on the laws of war, peace and international conduct. It is still not clear if this will make the difference our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] hopes it will but it has clearly made a difference to the standing of our country among other states."

 personality_events.9.t:0 "A Potion of Mana?"
 personality_events.9.d:0 "The secret to creating gold out of some lesser material has continued to elude [Root.Monarch.GetName] but in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] experiments [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has managed to create something [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] refers to as a 'Mana Potion'.

 personality_events.10.t:0 "Provincial Feud"
 personality_events.10.d:0 "What started as a dispute of minor concern between a local strongman and some of his tenants has somehow grown into a dispute of national importance. With priests, scholars, nobles and street demagogues all sharing their opinions as loudly as possible the parties of the feud have finally turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to have their conflict solved.\nHaving heard them plead their cases our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is convinced that the tenants, however, deplorable their situation, are the ones at fault. A just and well argued verdict is unlikely to upset anyone but it is quite tempting to use public opinion to increase our own authority over the province at this strongman's expense."
 personality_events.10.a:0 "Try to settle the issue justly."
 personality_events.10.b:0 "We must exploit this situation!"

 personality_events.11.d:0 "There are few monarchs who can boast such a fervent supporter base as [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] deputies are not always as fortunate however, in some cases our subjects simply refuse to accept that a particular governor, tax collector or other government official is acting on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s behalf. A petition has reached us about one such governor. According to popular belief he has been abusing our good will while making the people suffer."

 personality_events.12.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule is marked by remarkable cooperation, from the bureaucrats to the simple traders and even the republican aristocracy, everyone seems to feel that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has their good at heart. There is one group, however, that feel that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has let them down. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] own family and supporters feel we have not made enough use of our office.

 personality_events.13.t:0 "The Trusting Nature of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 personality_events.13.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is famously tolerant of the non-[Root.Religion.GetName] communities in our realm. Some would even say [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is too trusting and allow these non-believers to cloud [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] judgment. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] close confidant $TREASURER$$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$PHILOSOPHER$$ARTIST$$THEOLOGIAN$$MASTER_OF_MINT$$INQUISITOR$ has in particular attracted much jealousy and ill-will.

 personality_events.14.t:0 "Ravages of War"
 personality_events.14.d:0 "War is a terrible thing and even many years after peace has been concluded new subjects will long for the relative tranquility prior to the arrival of enemy troops.

 personality_events.15.d:0 "A strange man has been spotted in the countryside at various locations around our realm. He is teaching a most unorthodox version of the creation of the world to whoever will listen to his jovial ramblings. According to some he represents a dangerous and vile reinterpretation of holy scriptures but few of our subjects seem to have been taken in by the heresy. Rather many seem fond of this would-be prophet and his ideas.\nIntrigued by the reputation of [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a free thinking [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] the prophet is now demanding an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName], offering to act as an advisor in spiritual matters."
