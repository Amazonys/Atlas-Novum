 AN_adopt_writing_title: "Adopt Writing"
 AN_adopt_writing_desc: "Our people have developed to the stage at which we need to codify a written form of our own language, preserving our culture without allowing ourselves to be outcompeted. However, we must ensure that we do not get caught in the midst of our transition, when our society is changing and at its most vulnerable."
 AN_adapt_writing_title: "Adapt Writing"
 AN_adapt_writing_desc: "Our people have developed to the stage at which we need to develop the written word. Fortunately, we have already been exposed to the written language of others, and can bend their existing characters and rules to suit our own language, awkward as it may be in the interim. However, we must ensure that we do not get caught in the midst of our transition, when our society is divided and at its most vulnerable."

 edict_of_moulins_desc: "The Edict of Moulins is an important royal ordinance reforming the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, as well as limiting the appanages held by French princes.
