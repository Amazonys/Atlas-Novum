Their reign brought a Golden Age, with peace and stability. Albert and Isabella first sought to make the Netherlands independent from Spain, something that proved impossible, so instead they worked to reincorporate the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy. This was not popular among the Flemish social classes, but they did not give up their political agenda. The visual arts became their preferred tool and it proved perfect. The baroque had become popular and with Isabella's and Albert's patronage of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Coebergher, the De Nole family, the Van Veens and many others, the growth of this artistic movement was simulated and the Flemish Baroque painting created. The court at Brussels became full of people of all sorts, from artists and diplomats to defectors, spies and penitent traitors, from English musicians, Italian counsellors, Spanish confessors, Burgundian functionaries, German bodyguards to the Belgian Nobles.

She is already trained in administrative and military matters by Malhar Rao who strongly believes her to become a capable ruler. The army is enthusiastic over her leadership, as Ahilyabai has led them in person on her favorite elephant armed with bows and quivers of arrows. We have seen what she has accomplished when her husband and father-in-law were alive, she has led armies into battle, is a patron of temples, has developed small villages into prosperous and beautiful cities, built forts and roads and made our capital into the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise."

She is a beautiful, cultured and courageous woman whose great skill at maintaining a household of harmony has been tested many times. She makes sure a strong spirit of camaraderie and shared struggles is cultivated among the members of the household. If it had not been for her, Mir Hedayatullah, the chief huntsman and koka, would have never been forgiven by Prince Muhammad Azam when they had exchanged bitter words after a spat. Azam trusted her and confided in her, as she was his favorite wife and vastly loved by him. This helped when Jahanzeb had to persuade him to let Mir Hedayatullah rejoin the household. The relationship between their son Prince Bidar Bakht and Azam is often poisoned due to imperial favor, and it is up to Jahanzeb to soothe the relation and make sure they got along. Jahanzeb led her husband's troops when he had to move ahead upon summons from his father, and she mounted her elephant three years later to encourage a lagging [Root.GetAdjective] counter-attack on the enemy. It was then she made a promise to commit suicide if the [Root.GetAdjective] Army was overrun. Thankfully, that did not happen."

Ending her career a wealthy woman, she retired with her husband Chang Pao. There are those who say that her fleet consisted of over 300 junks manned by 20,000-40,000 pirates, while others claim that she had 1,800 ships with a crew of about 80,000 men, women, and even children. Ching Shih used to be a prostitute until she was captured by pirates and married Jihng Yat, one of the most notorious pirates before she took control of his fleet after his death. The Red Flag Fleet was a coalition of several competing Cantonese pirate fleets gathered by Jihng Yat using military assertion and his reputation. He died in Vietnam and Ching Shih maneuvered her way into his leadership position by cultivating personal relationships. She managed to make herself essential to the captains and united the fleet by issuing a code of laws. The first law was that anyone giving their own orders or disobeying those of a superior were beheaded immediately. The second law forbade theft from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates. The third law was that all goods taken as booty had to be presented and registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader. 20 percent was given to the original seizer and the rest was placed in the public fund. The fourth law was that all actual money was to be turned over to the squadron leader and used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships. The fleet robbed towns, markets and villages from Macau to Canton, even establishing hegemony over many coastal villages, in some cases imposing levies and taxes on settlements."

This has led to conflict between her and her son's widow Wubit who wishes to preside at her son's court. Mentewab has summoned her Qwaran relatives and their forces for support, while Wubit has summoned her Oromo relatives and their considerable forces. We have already seen what Mentewab has done for our country, the buildings she has built such as the castle, the large banqueting hall and a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

Anna Leopoldovna's regency for her infant Ivan VI has been marked by high taxes and economic problems, which has furthered Elizaveta's cause. The Russian guards regiments supports her and could be the determining force that compels us to anoint her ruler. She has promised to never sign death sentences but is not adverse to spill blood. With the words, "Who do you want to serve? Me, the natural sovereign, or those who have stolen my inheritance?" the Preobrazhensky Regiment was convinced to join her. Hopefully she has inherited her father's genius for government, Elizaveta has already shown signs of keen judgment and diplomatic tact that remains us of Peter the Great. Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin is rumored to become her new vice chancellor, a formidable diplomat, and she has expressed her dissatisfaction with the cabinet council system, wishing to reconstitute the senate as it had been under Peter the Great, with the chiefs of the departments of state attending.

The [Root.GetAdjective] Supreme Privy Council has decided to publicly support her as our new ruler, hoping that she will become a figurehead or at least malleable enough to allow them to rule through her. A set of laws that will limit her powers is being drafted, prohibiting Anna to start war, call for peace, create new taxes, or promote individuals to high ranks. Nor will she be able to punish nobility without trial, grant estates or villages, promote anyone to court office, and she will not be able to spend the revenue generated by the state. Eight hundred noblemen have heard the rumors of Anna's possible ascent to the throne and have signed a petition that will urge her to continue to rule $COUNTRY$ in an autocratic style and to continue to carry out Peter the Great's political, social, and economic advances. We doubt that Anna will become a figurehead, nor will she be easy to control. She was brought to the [Root.GetAdjective] court early in life, making her well prepared to handle political structure.

When her husband died, her son Murad was away, serving as Governor. Nurbanu realized that his abscence had created the prefect opportunity for someone else to seize the throne, with the Sultan dead and his son away from the capital. Fortunately for her and her son, Selim II had died in the harem and as security and privacy was strict, no one knew of his death. She kept it a secret, hid the body in an icebox and sent words to her son to return to the capital. Murad arrived twelve days later and with the death of Selim made public, their son became Sultan and Nurbanu became Queen Mother or Valide Sultan.

The "Inscriptions on the Ridge Pole of the White Jade Pavilion in the Kwanghan Palace" was written by her when she was only eight years old, earning her the epithet "Immortal Maiden" as it was recognized as a work of poetic genius. Heo Pong introduced her to Chinese writing such as the Confucian Five Classics when she showed a natural talent for hanum verse. Forced into exile because of his political leanings, Heo Pong left her further education in the hands of their younger brother Heo Gyun. He was a gifted poet who studied under a specialist of Tang poetry, Yi Tal, who took it upon him to share Tang Poetry with Nanseolheon. Tang poetry has influenced her work, shown in the naturalism of her poetry. When Nanseolheon married Kim Seongnip her poetry started to lament the plight and sufferings of married women. Her early literature employed folklore and natural imagery, common to Tang tradition, but now her poetry is weighted down with an emotive language."

She is a Hindu and her marriage to Akbar led him to look more favorable on Hinduism and his Hindu subjects. It also gave Akbar the powerful support of her family throughout his reign, and with the marriage to a Hindu Rajput princess he signaled that he would be the Badshah of his whole people, no matter their religion. Few women in court has ever been granted the right to issue farman, official documents which are usually the exclusive privilege of the emperor, but Akbar trusted Mariam-uz-Zamani enough to grant her that privilege. She used her title Wali Nimat Begam - the Gift of God - when she issued farmans.
