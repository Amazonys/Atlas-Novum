While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this: the wrath of [send_cardinal_province.Owner.GetUsableName], the country he'd be deserting."

 aow_events.44.d:0 "A cardinal who had previously stayed in [Root.GetName], close to the border, has now moved out of our nation entirely and shifted his allegiance to our neighbors. The [From.GetAdjective] agents who bribed him to betray us probably thought we would not notice their hand in the matter, but they were wrong. This intentional sabotage of our influence in the Curia is unacceptable and will not stand unchallenged."

 aow_events.45.t:0 "Thoughts of Heresy"
 aow_events.45.d:0 "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has lived close to the heretics in our nation and rather than condemn them, he has tried to understand them. While a sympathetic course of action, he has recently approached one of our ministers confessing that he has himself started to doubt Church doctrine. If this came to the Pope's knowledge, he would no longer be allowed to serve in the Curia, but perhaps we could convince him to keep this to himself for a few ducats."

 aow_events.46.t:0 "Pope Discovers Duplicity"
 aow_events.46.d:0 "The cardinal we bribed to keep silent about his doubts of Church doctrine unfortunately still believed in confessing his sins. Even more unfortunately, the manner in which he did this to the Pope has not granted him forgiveness, perhaps because he does not truly regret his doubts. While he does regret taking our bribe, this too has come to the knowledge of the Holy Father, who is displeased with us as much as the now former cardinal."
 aow_events.46.a:0 "Is it too late for us to ask forgiveness, too?"
 aow_events.47.t:0 "Cardinal Distrusts Heathens"
 aow_events.47.d:0 "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been loyal to [Root.Owner.GetName] so far, but is starting to have doubts about his continued stay here after seeing heathens living so close to his home city of [Root.GetCapitalName]. In a letter to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], he has claimed that these people cannot be trusted and requested that they be subject to much more stringent regulations than our other citizens."

They recently discovered that a man who has just been promoted to cardinal, who is also a good friend of theirs, is considering moving to our country to facilitate their mutual work on a theological text. If we aided this process, we would have a cardinal in the Curia who is not only loyal to $THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$, but also to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 aow_events.49.d:0 "One of the cardinals in [Root.GetName] has proven to be a skilled administrator and already provides useful advice to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. At this point, making him a minister in our government would almost be only a formality, but an important formality nonetheless, since he may grow more powerful yet. Having a cardinal in our service would certainly lend us credibility with the Pope and strengthen the sentiment that [Root.GetName] is a Catholic nation first and foremost."

 aow_events.50.t:0 "Cardinal's Policies Upset Nobles"
 aow_events.50.d:0 "Since we made one of our cardinals a minister in our government, he has gone far beyond providing theological insights and innovated significantly in the administration of [Root.GetName]. Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the nobles, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the nobles who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."

 aow_events.51.d:0 "While conducting espionage in one of our neighboring countries, our operatives shadowed a powerful man, a cardinal, and discovered that although his loyalty appears incorruptible, his morals are already corrupt beyond what the Church can possibly imagine. Although the details of his transgressions are not of interest to us, they may be of interest to the Pope and give us a chance to weaken our neighbor's influence in the Curia. On the other hand, having a hold on a man of his rank could be useful in many situations."
 aow_events.51.a:0 "The Holy See must be informed of his actions."
 aow_events.51.b:0 "We can use this as blackmail to improve our spy network."
 aow_events.52.t:0 "Cardinal Exposed"
 aow_events.52.d:0 "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been rumored to be of weak character, but has always been discrete enough not to warrant further investigation. Now it appears that foreign spies from [From.GetName] who have had their eye on him put an end to this and exposed his sins to the Pope. His days as a cardinal are numbered, and our power in the Curia will be weakened due to this untimely [From.GetAdjective] intervention."
 aow_events.52.a:0 "What an underhanded way of getting at our influence."

 west_african.1.d:0 "Our people have come a long way from their origins. Where there were once many tribes with their own customs and leaders, people throughout [Root.GetName] now recognize [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their ruler. Many have speculated that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may soon declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Sultan, but this may not go without contention unless the title is given to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by the Caliph.\n\nWord has reached us that the Ottoman Caliphate has its seat in the distant city of Istanbul and they may just be willing to grant us an audience. Perhaps with the Caliph's blessing, the Sultanate of [Root.GetName] will find support among the faithful of its citizens."
 west_african.1.a:0 "Let us travel to this faraway land and seek their support!"
 west_african.1.b:0 "We do not need their approval to reign!"
 west_african.2.t:0 "A Sultan in [From.GetName]"
 west_african.2.d:0 "An emissary has arrived from the lands of [From.GetName], seeking support from [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] capacity as Caliph for the creation of a new sultanate. Once a collection of disparate tribes, we are informed that the [From.GetAdjective] people are now pious Muslims and devoted to their ruler, [From.Monarch.GetName], who wishes to seize the title of Sultan with our support."
 west_african.2.a:0 "A noble goal. The foundation of a new sultanate is a blessing to us as well."
 west_african.2.b:0 "If you wish to be Sultan, you must convince the people yourself."
 west_african.3.t:0 "Caliph Approves of Sultanate"
 west_african.3.d:0 "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, bringing news of how the leader of the Muslim world has decreed that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the Sultan of [Root.GetName]. What may have otherwise turned into a violent struggle for power and political upheaval will now see the support of most, maybe all, of the wise and faithful among the [Root.GetAdjective] people."

 west_african.4.t:0 "Caliph Disapproves of Sultanate"
 west_african.4.d:0 "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, but despite our best efforts, the Caliph would not grant us the title. According to [From.Monarch.GetHerHim], it is up to us to convince the people of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s capacity to rule as Sultan."
 west_african.4.a:0 "A Caliph displaying such poor judgment is hardly fit for the title."
 west_african.5.t:0 "People of the Desert"
 west_african.5.d:0 "The [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people have lived in this arid climate for a long time. Although this causes some foolish nations to dismiss us as inhabiting the land unwanted by others, we have mastered skills of survival and combat that they would be wise to fear.\n\nJust across the border at [Root.GetName], our brethren are suffering the oppression of other people, people who may not be prepared for what the [Root.Culture.GetName] are capable of when you underestimate them. With the help of these locals, we could organize a raid into the lands of their oppressors, striking quickly and taking advantage of the fact that we know the desert there better than anyone else."
 west_african.5.a:0 "We will arrive and withdraw like a sandstorm."
 west_african.5.b:0 "We will not assault our neighbors like this, regardless of who their subjects are."
 west_african.6.t:0 "Desert Raiders"
 west_african.6.d:0 "Some people from the [Root.Culture.GetName] elite have recently been attacked by what they believe to be a raid organized by foreign military. Initially, the attack seemed to have occurred too deep into our borders for this to be possible, but an explanation for how this could have happened has begun to take shape. The [From.Culture.GetName] in one of our border provinces, who we thought to be our loyal subjects, appear to have conspired with our neighbors to organize the attack.\n\nWhile it may not be possible to retaliate in kind, there are other ways we can show what we think of such cowardly tactics."
 west_african.6.a:0 "Sooner or later, they will pay."
 west_african.7.t:0 "A Safer Border"
 west_african.7.d:0 "A long time has passed, but we have not forgotten how [Root.GetName] once served as an entry point for an audacious attack to plunder our country. Many people believe that this threat remains real, and demands that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] act upon it, strengthening our control of the border and ensuring that desert raiders are not allowed to cross it ever again."
 west_african.7.a:0 "We will dispatch the necessary troops immediately."
 west_african.7.b:0 "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will travel to patrol the border [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!"
 west_african.7.c:0 "Surely some local initiative can be arranged."
 west_african.8.t:0 "Wasteland to Some"
 west_african.8.d:0 "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have always been resourceful and adaptive beyond what others would consider possible, and lands others may find impossible to inhabit or even traverse are our homes, our roads and our domain. We could made good use of this, including in our country's trade efforts. One of our main trade routes is in fact right next to such an area, and there have been discussions about how to best take advantage of this."
 west_african.8.a:0 "We can send our caravans on routes that we alone know."
 west_african.8.b:0 "It can be used as a base to stage an attack on the trade route."
 west_african.9.t:0 "Idolatry or Reverence?"
 west_african.9.d:0 "Our efforts to bring salvation to the heathens in [Root.GetName] have borne fruit, but it is a strange and unfamiliar fruit. The local population has started to accept Christ, but the faith has been intertwined with their old ways. Angels and spirits, the true Lord and the old Lord of the Sky, the Blessed Virgin and the Earth Goddess... do these people really believe in what they hear, or do they simply call their old idols by different names? The local missionary has come to us for advice, concerned about the souls of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people, and his own."
 west_african.9.a:0 "Their faith is pure, and we would be fools to reject it."
 west_african.9.b:0 "This is worse than heresy. It must be rooted out."
 west_african.10.t:0 "God of the Sky"
 west_african.10.d:0 "We trust in the spirits, in the gods that have always been with us, and our people are rarely impressed by the lies of those who would lead us from them. However, some people on our border who have come into contact with those who worship one they claim returned from the dead seem to have seen similarities between their faith and ours. Just as many here choose to worship the Sky Father, our neighbors speak of the one the call Christ as having a Heavenly Father himself. Many have begun to suggest that these two may be one and the same, and that the animosity between our faiths is nothing but a misunderstanding."
 west_african.10.a:0 "This is simply another lie they spread to force their faith upon us."
 west_african.10.b:0 "We have different names for many other things, so why not gods?"
 west_african.11.t:0 "Tradition or Haram?"
 west_african.11.d:0 "Bringing the word of the Prophet to the people of [Root.GetName] has not been impossible, but the outcome so far has troubled some of our religious scholars. Although they have abandoned many pagan traditions, a reverence for ancestors remains with troubling undertones of worship. We see no fault in honoring one's family, but when prayers are directed to the dead and not to God, can anything good really come of it? Nevertheless, these are ancient practices. Rejecting them may alienate many of those who would otherwise listen."
 west_african.11.a:0 "We will respect their practices as equal to our own."
 west_african.11.b:0 "There is no God but God. If they will not learn this, we have achieved nothing."
 west_african.12.t:0 "Many Spirits, One God"
 west_african.12.d:0 "We have known of the Muslim faith for a long time, but chosen to remain true to our traditions. Those who devote themselves only to the distant creator, forsaking the gods and spirits that dwell among us, are certainly on the path to misfortune.\n\nPeople at the border, who live next to Muslims every day, have started to see things differently. They find that the words of Muhammad speak to them as well as their neighbors and rather than seeing this as a betrayal of the old ways, they identify the prophet's God with our most revered sky deity."
 west_african.12.a:0 "Your ancestors go forgotten while you pray to the sky. This is unacceptable."
 west_african.12.b:0 "Perhaps if we accept their one God, they will consider our many."
 west_african.13.t:0 "No Compromises in Faith"
 west_african.13.d:0 "Although many of our citizens are not yet followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have remained hopeful and patient. Others are not so patient. Many of our citizens consider it absurd that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], ruling by the grace of God, accepts the widespread paganism in our country. This, in turn, has sparked concern among the very same pagans that they are subjects of an externally imposed belief system, with some of them calling for the overthrow of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does not show reverence for the spiritual practices that have lived with the people here for millennia."
 west_african.13.a:0 "The believers are right. We will not tolerate this godlessness."
 west_african.13.b:0 "The animists, although misguided, must be respected as citizens."

 west_african.14.d:0 "Although cut off from many of our faith, we have not forsaken Islamic scholarship. $THEOLOGIAN$ is just one of many who have written great works on the subject, their work inspiring countless others. Through our dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the theological works of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made it a famous city."

 west_african.15.t:0 "The Flora of [Root.GetName]"
 west_african.15.d:0 "The scholars and scientists among the [Root.GetAdjective] have been distinguished by extraordinary innovation and curiosity. Their latest efforts have focused on gathering information about the plant life of the large jungle areas of our land, hoping to gain useful information to aid in researching medicine and dyeing techniques. This has been successful so far, with the botany project rippling developments into other areas of research."
 west_african.15.a:0 "And much is yet to be discovered."
 west_african.16.t:0 "The Weapons of our Neighbors"
 west_african.16.d:0 "Although we do not doubt the strength and tenacity of our [Root.GetAdjective] warriors, the technological advances of the neighboring armies have not passed by without our notice. The adoption of firearms greatly changes warfare, and we can see clear advantages in this.\n\nOur neighbors are unlikely to provide us with all the technical details to fully equip our army, but they do seem willing to sell us some of their weapons. While this would probably give them an advantage in terms of our trade exchanges, it would doubtlessly be of use to our military efforts."
 west_african.16.a:0 "We must acquire this equipment at any cost."
 west_african.16.b:0 "Our army serves its purpose, with or without these weapons."
 west_african.17.t:0 "Transatlantic Slave Trade"
 west_african.17.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is far from the only country keeping slaves, with this being a common fate for war captives in the area. Our European neighbors seem to have especially interested in this lately, seemingly being in desperate need for servants to work the new land they have seized across the ocean. To this end, they are now attempting to arrange a long-term trade agreement with us that will facilitate this purchase of slaves.\n\nWhile we stand to earn money from this, the implications have been the cause of some concern. They apparently consider our people, or at least our captives, to be suitable as their slaves and treat them with unbounded brutality. We don't wish to humor this notion, but there is no telling what they might end up doing if we refuse."
 west_african.17.a:0 "None will be sold to these people if we can help it."
 west_african.17.b:0 "If they can pay, we can provide."
 west_african.17.c:0 "It's time to put an end to the practice of slavery, for us as well as for them."
 west_african.18.t:0 "Once Nomads"
 west_african.18.d:0 "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people of [Root.GetName] have traditionally lived, at least in part, a nomadic life. Although our efforts to centralize have made this less feasible, people are used to it and expect us not to intervene. It does make [Root.Owner.GetName] more difficult to manage, however. Some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors have suggested that we try to take control and restrict their movements, but this could be seen as trampling the way of life that made them successful in the first place."
 west_african.18.a:0 "Let them live as they always did."
 west_african.18.b:0 "[Root.GetName] is unruly enough as it is."
 west_african.19.t:0 "The Ashanti"
 west_african.19.d:0 "The Akan people of Kumasi and the surrounding region have lived there for a long time now, although we have not considered them a nation in their own right. However, their tribe is of such importance to our present affairs that we need to conduct trade and diplomacy with them. Although the nature of the Akan state may yet change, we cannot question its existence."
 west_african.19.a:0 "Who knows, one day they may become grow to the strength of an empire."
 west_african.20.t:0 "Sika 'dwa: The Golden Stool"
 west_african.20.d:1 "The Ashanti have neighbored one of colonies for some time, so far without any major diplomatic incidents. This all changed recently, when our governor $COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, our representative at the Gold Coast, heard of the Golden Stool. This mysterious old artifact apparently holds great significance to the Ashanti, to whom it is the seat of the king. Although we have been vaguely aware of its existence before, it recently came to the knowledge of $COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, who demands to sit on it as a demonstration of his, and by extension our, paramount power in the area. \n\n'Why am I not sitting on the Golden Stool at this moment?' he has asked the Ashanti, who have so far shown no sign of complying. Indeed, they seem highly insulted by the suggestion alone. How far should we be willing to pursue this?"
 west_african.20.a:0 "As far as it takes!"
 west_african.20.a.tt:0 "The Ashanti may not take kindly to this."
 west_african.20.b:0 "We have no use for a man who demands such means to assert his dominance."
 west_african.21.t:0 "War of the Golden Stool"
 west_african.21.d:0 "The Golden Stool is the symbol of the Ashanti king, which no one is allowed to violate. Now, the [From.GetAdjective], who we trusted had some respect for our traditions despite their disinterest in them, have sent a governor here who demands to sit upon the Stool as if he was king himself. This has outraged the Queen Mother and many others, who are arguing that this man must be stopped and the sanctity of the Golden Stool preserved, at the cost of war if necessary."
 west_african.21.a:0 "If [From.GetName] trusts such a fool to represent them, there can only be war."
 west_african.21.b:0 "Traditions are not worth starting a war over."
 west_african.22.t:0 "Self-rule for the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.22.d:0 "The [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] rule [Root.Owner.GetName] justly, we believe. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has been fair to the different tribes under our rule, but to some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects, this is not enough. The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have sent a representative from [Root.GetName], requesting greater rights to make decisions about their own tribes if they are to remain under the reign of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Although seemingly a humble request, the news of discontent in their home provinces makes it sound more like a demand."
 west_african.22.a:0 "The tribes are best ruled that rule themselves."
 west_african.22.b:0 "We don't give into demands, even if veiled."
 west_african.23.t:0 "Raids Through the Jungle"
 west_african.23.d:0 "Ever since our adoption of cavalry, the mounted warriors of [Root.GetName] have been feared by all for their uncanny ability to rapidly attack deep inside enemy territory, raiding and weakening the defenses. A group of soldiers have prepared a plan to aid the ongoing war based on this tactic, preparing to break off from the main army and perform the attack in secret, before the enemy can react. Although a risky plan, it could yield much-needed funds for the war."
 west_african.23.a:0 "We need more plans like these!"
 west_african.23.b:0 "Bring me those who planned this and let them aid our greater schemes instead."
 west_african.24.t:0 "Into the Unknown"
 west_african.24.d:0 "The uncharted territory within and beyond the jungles at our border may seem threatening to many other people. But our tribe has lived in lands like these for a long time, and would never have thrived if we feared exploring the unknown. Now, a large group of young hunters are asking for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s permission to explore and settle in whatever place they may discover. Certainly, these are capable people who could get a lot done if they didn't waste time on dreams of places not yet known, but who are we to put a stop to youthful curiosity?"
 west_african.24.a:0 "Go and claim what you find for [Root.GetName]!"
 west_african.24.b:0 "We are the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they are needed here."
 west_african.25.t:0 "New Dyes"
 west_african.25.d:0 "Our research into the plant life of [Root.GetName] continues to lead to new discoveries. We have recently uncovered a new way to create dyes, which is both efficient and results in impressive colors not found anywhere else that we know of. Since dyes is one of the important [Root.GetAdjective] exports, we will see that these valuable techniques are spread quickly throughout our land."
 west_african.25.a:0 "We are dyeing to try them out!"
 west_african.26.t:0 "The Spirits Remain"
 west_african.26.d:0 "Many foreign religions have attempted to set their roots among us and many missionaries have tried to turn us towards a God, always the one God, always the same, always different, always theirs. But despite the trying times we have gone through, we keep honoring the spirits and our ancestors. Now the elders have told us that the time is right for a larger celebration of these ancient rites and that people throughout [Root.GetName] should be encouraged to participate.\n\nWith the very people who would see us converted right across the border, this sort of nationwide event would probably attract some irritation from those who consider themselves above it. Our diplomats are suggesting we keep it at a smaller scale, so as to not offend our neighbors."

 west_african.28.d:0 "While our efforts to adopt certain technologies from Europe have been somewhat impeded by the ongoing war, applying our new weapons in the field has had a positive impact.

While it is easy to deny him the honor he seeks and try to isolate him politically we run the risk of distancing ourselves of someone in control over much of our economic heartland.\nOn the other hand perhaps it would be most prudent to strike at him now instead of prolonging a conflict that many feel will be inevitable."

These holy men have mobilized the hearts of our people and the process of land reclamation suddenly seems to be going a lot smoother than it ever has before.

 tyw_events.10.d:0 "The Hungarian people of [Root.GetName] have begun to see the religious conflict in the Empire as one between them and the Habsburgs who rule [Root.Owner.GetName]. When war rages between Protestant and Catholic kings and emperors, they claim that the people must take up arms to protect their faith as well. As if the ongoing war was not enough, we must now grapple with these troublemakers in lands that should long since have accepted being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty."

 tyw_events.11.t:0 "Huguenots Gather in La Rochelle"
 tyw_events.11.d:0 "The wars of religion may be over, but the religious conflicts in France are not. The Huguenot heretics, claiming to be concerned about their right to practice their faith under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], have started to prepare for what might very well be open revolt. Although they have not gone that far yet, they have gathered in the city of La Rochelle and started to fortify its defensive structures. Their exact intentions are not clear, but the more rebellious among them claim that they will create an independent state, breaking free from French and Catholic rule."
 tyw_events.11.a:0 "If this continues, we may just turn out to be as ruthless as they claim us to be."
 tyw_events.12.t:0 "Huguenot Rebels Need Our Help"
 tyw_events.12.d:0 "Although [Root.GetName] is now free from the tyranny of the Catholic Church, many suffer the same oppression abroad. The Huguenots in France have found it necessary to build fortifications in preparation of the terrors the French regime no doubt are willing to visit upon them.\n\nAs true as the faith of these brave people might be, it is doubtful if they have the means to resist the power of the French army. However, with the backing of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], anything is possible."

 tyw_events.13.d:0 "The Huguenot dissidents who gathered in La Rochelle, previously showing at least some caution, have been emboldened by the support of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. Apparently the treacherous heretics in [From.GetName] have seen it fit not only to spread their lies to France, but to spark fires here as well. Whether or not they will honor their promise, the Huguenots are now in open revolt."
 tyw_events.13.a:0 "Enemies of France will pay for this, in La Rochelle as well as in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tyw_events.14.t:0 "Fall of Prague"
 tyw_events.14.d:0 "Prague has been home to many kings and even emperors and is a city with many legacies within it. With today's capture by [Root.GetAdjective] troops, there is certainly a temptation to bring some of the city's treasures back to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and claim them for our own. With some rare artifacts being peerless in the known world, this may be our only chance to get our hands on them... but hardly without drawing the anger of Prague's citizens."

 tyw_events.16.t:0 "Wallenstein's Loyalties Doubted"
 tyw_events.16.d:0 "Since joining our forces early in the war, Wallenstein has shown himself to be very capable as a military commander. However, although he has made an effort to appear loyal and grateful, he is known to disagree with many of Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decisions. Reliable sources indicate that he has even been angered by some of our refusals to compromise in the conflict. Many now suspect him of considering defecting to the enemy. Fortunately, some of the officers in his forces are still loyal to us first. They could ensure he never fights for another League."
 tyw_events.16.a:0 "He needs to be captured, alive or dead."

Our dependence on Wallenstein's military leadership while the war put increased strain on our nation and Empire made him bold enough to desert us in the midst of the war, fleeing to join the enemy. Our troops have not seen the last of him on the battlefields, but he will now be leading the armies of the traitors against the Emperor."

 tyw_events.18.d:0 "Our war to stop the [From.Religion.GetName] tyranny of the Holy Roman Emperor in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made even [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own generals doubt their cause. After seeing [From.GetName]'s refusal to compromise as the war drags on, Albrecht von Wallenstein has decided that he would be better off serving us. It appears they doubted his loyalties one time too many."

 tyw_events.19.d:0 "A siege dragging on over winter is always costly and best avoided completely. This winter has been particularly harsh and one of our sieges has seen both equipment and soldiers freezing. At this rate, we'll either have to recuperate and wait out the winter or send in more men, many of whom are likely to die from cold and starvation.

Our small nation lies in the midst of a brewing conflict, and at the worst possible time, our ruler is in poor health and lacks heirs. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] passing, Pomerania sees the end of the Griffins, who have ruled this nation for centuries, and risks partition by the powers who are opportunistically striking against the weakest parts of the Empire."

 tyw_events.21.d:0 "After ruling Pomerania for centuries, the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the House of Griffins to reign in the country has passed away without an heir. With the ongoing religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it would not be impossible for someone with ambition to lay claim to the region. However, we are not the only ones who have noticed this, and many powers may soon prepare to get their share to Pomeranian lands."

 tyw_events.22.d:0 "The League war has been brought to the heart of our nation, and yet we have suffered defeat. [From.GetAdjective] forces engaged ours near our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and won, which has caused both concern and shame in our military. The war may be won yet, but this battle may still be remembered, whether we like it or not."
 tyw_events.22.a:0 "We can only hope our future successes will overshadow it."
 tyw_events.23.t:0 "Enemies of the League"
 tyw_events.23.d:0 "Our decision to take a stance in the religious conflict in the Holy Roman Empire has caused even more heated discussions about where [Root.GetName] stands on the issue of the Reformation. We may not doubt the goals of the League, but there is no shortage of people in our country who do. What is obvious to us, that we have chosen the right side for the good of all [Root.GetAdjective] people regardless of faith, seems like the lies of heretics to some of our subjects. The most zealous objectors have taken up arms against their rulers and the League."

 tyw_events.24.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a practically minded ruler. Although as pious as any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], politically expedient alliances come first, and despite our [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have joined a religious League that opposes our beliefs. Most advisors see this as a necessity - some of them may even have suggested it.\n\n$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ is not such an advisor. A person of faith, they have hid their outrage at our decision poorly and their attitude is now beginning to impact our international diplomacy. Although we remain loyal to the League, we may find it difficult to retain good relations with its members when we are not only of the wrong faith, but keep such company."

This has led some of them to question whether they belong under the rule of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] at all. Increasingly, they are requesting the right for locals who represent their interests to make decisions on how the province should be ruled. We are reaching a point where some kind of compromise has to be made."

 tyw_events.26.d:0 "The Society of Jesus, a congregation more commonly known as by the name of its members, the Jesuits, have offered to provide an education for young [Root.Heir.GetName]. Many relatives and advisors have supported the suggestion, hoping that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will grow up to become, as the Jesuits call themselves, a soldier of God. In these turbulent times, they argue, strength of the spirit is the most important trait of a ruler. Others fear that a people so close to the Church would harden the nascent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s heart to those who stray from its doctrine."
 tyw_events.26.a:0 "We need a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who can fight for our faith!"

 tyw_events.29.d:1 "The occupation of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has frightened many among [From.GetName]'s nobility, causing them to flee the country and hoping to find shelter among their fellow followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith here. Since the conflict is religious, at least on the surface, we would be expected to aid those who share our faith. Yet the eyes of the League's enemies are ever upon us, and there are many who would not take kindly to seeing their enemies under our protection."

However, Sweden is no longer under the rule of the Danish crown and has not been for a long time. Perhaps they should start paying the price as well - there is only so much generosity we can show for old time's sake, after all."

Not far from our border, Hungarian followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion are in exactly that unacceptable situation. Our nation has strong bonds with Hungary in law and in spirit, and cannot let this continue.

When meeting another [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler in person, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will often ask them to pray together for their common goals. While perhaps forsaking some of the distance sometimes needed in diplomacy, it can create stronger bonds than any formal agreement. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has considered employing this method again on an upcoming visit to a foreign capital, although it is not certain if it will be successful."

 tyw_events.40.d:0 "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going poorly. Since religion is at the core of this conflict, many of those who once claimed that God was with us when we decided to join the League are now claiming that God is depriving us of the means of war and wants us to make peace.

As neither branch has been powerful enough to defeat the other entirely, the Idrisid and Dawudid lines have come take short turns on the throne. Some rulers have not even lasted a year.
