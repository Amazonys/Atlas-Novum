Artists with exemplary performances, praises the divine, the humane and the royal line are first to produce what is now an era-defining trend across all houses of art and culture in Europe!"
 flavor_fra.118.a:0 "What a performance, my dear!"
 
 flavor_fra.119.t:1 "The French Signoria of Genoa"
 flavor_fra.119.d:0 "For far too long have the governors of Genoa enjoyed autonomy from the French crown. The Signoria had always been very close to the French crown for both political and financial reasons however it is time we solidify our relations and use their coin and wealth to further push our Italian agenda."
 flavor_fra.119.a:1 "They are now a proper part of our domain!"
 
 flavor_fra.120.t:0 "Treaty of the Golden Bulls"
 flavor_fra.120.d:0 "Battle after battle, conquest after conquest. The bond between us and the French crown has only grown as time went on, to that of a familiar robust friendship. Thanks to them, we now control substantial portions of our home region in Italy, and the time has come to take our relationship one step further, according to both our advisors and the agreements we signed with the French ruler."
 flavor_fra.120.a:0 "Together as one!"
 flavor_fra.120.b:0 "Never!"
 
 flavor_fra.121.t:0 "The Heirs of Charlemagne"
 flavor_fra.121.d:1 "Centuries ago, a legendary Frankish emperor struck fear in the heart of his enemies. Now, once more the royal line on France's throne has come to press this claim as the rightful heirs of Charlemagne and demand the immediate abdication of the Holy Roman Empire throne to them! What madness is this that motivates them to even conceive such outlandish claims!?"
 flavor_fra.121.a:0 "We must abdicate the Emperorship"
 flavor_fra.121.b:0 "Use imperial means to impose sanctions upon the French!"
 flavor_fra.121.c:0 "Counter their claims!"
 
 flavor_fra.200.t:0 "The French Alliance Prevails"
 flavor_fra.200.d:0 "We have succeeded in dispelling the evil that treaded the Germanic lands! After countless hard-fought battles and an abundant shedding of blood, our foes are no more! None shall henceforth dispute our claim as the masters of the Germanic people as we carve our name in the books of history with golden letters."
 flavor_fra.200.a:0 "In this hour, no darkness shall endure!"
 
 flavor_fra.201.t:0 "Protectors of the Empire"
 flavor_fra.201.d:0 "We have finally achieved our rightful place among the legends of our time, the throne once taken from us is now back with its rightful owners, the French royal line! Unlike our predecessors, we shall not slacken our duties to preserve the Empire and provide protection to its many and diverse inhabitants!"
 flavor_fra.201.a:0 "We are the shield of the Empire!"
 
 flavor_fra.202.t:0 "The Rade of the Toulon Arsenal"
 flavor_fra.202.d:0 "The word rade comes from the old English term 'Road' "a protected place near shore, not so enclosed as a harbor, where ships can ride at anchor." The Rade of Toulon is one of the best natural anchorages on the Mediterranean, and the largest rade in Europe. It is protected from the sea by the peninsula of Giens and the peninsula of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, and has been used as a military harbor since the 15th century. The Rade shelters the port of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, the port of La Seyne-sur-Mer, as well as the arsenal, or military port of Toulon, and the commercial port.\n\nThe early modern history of the port began when [Root.Monarch.GetName] built his Tour Royale at Toulon in [GetYear]. A naval arsenal and shipyard were built simultaneously, and small a sheltered harbour, the Veille Darse, was built a few years later to protect ships from the wind and sea. The shipyard was greatly enlarged by a later Cardinal, who wished to make Provence into a Mediterranean naval power."
 flavor_fra.202.a:0 "Let it be built!"
 
 flavor_fra.203.t:0 "The French Isles"
 flavor_fra.203.d:0 "Our greatest foe, the royal line in the Isles, has perished. In their stead, they left an economy in shambles, a headless people led astray, without a voice to guide them. Despite our rivalry, it would be wise to consider integrating them into our administration. Alternatively, we would have every right to enforce their conformity to our rules and customs."
 flavor_fra.203.a:0 "Let us integrate them in our administration."
 flavor_fra.203.b:0 "France reigns supreme!"
 
 flavor_fra.204.t:0 "La Sorbonne"
 flavor_fra.204.d:0 "The university of Paris is by far not the only scientific institute in [Root.GetName] of the year [GetYear]. While our land hosts a great many such forums of thought, la Sorbonne, as the Paris University is called, is by far the most celebrated and illustrious of them all. Originally built during the 13th century, recent extensive renovations have breathed valuable life into the faculty, allowing it to expand its halls, curriculum and prestige alongside the other universities in our land!"
 flavor_fra.204.a:1 "Hic et ubique terrarum! (Here and anywhere on Earth)"

 flavor_fra.205.t:0 "The Holy Lands of Jerusalem"
 flavor_fra.205.d:0 "Time and time again the Catholic world attempted to liberate Jerusalem and protect the city and its inhabitants from heathen attacks. However, despite praying and utilizing scores of men as well as several Crusades, our people were never sufficiently successful. Despite that, recent progress in the Levant has granted us the right to proclaim the resurrection of the legendary crusader kingdom under the French banner, God wills it!"
 flavor_fra.205.a:0 "Their banner shall fly once more!"
 flavor_fra.205.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful ruler of the holy lands!"
  
 flavor_fra.206.t:0 "The Hundred Years War in France"
 flavor_fra.206.d:0 "The Hundred Years War begun in 1337 due to a dispute between our throne and the English house of Plantagenet. During the past century, the war grew in scale and scope, enveloping at times various factions of Western Europe. Recently, the tide has turned, granting our troops the upper hand in reconquering long-lost land from the accursed English king, who now cowers across the Channel. The coming of Joan of Arc and her legendary valor inspired our nation to push ahead with the war effort despite our then-disadvantaged position. Military leaders like Jean Bureau and Jean de Dunois will certainly route the remaining English influence away from European shores and back from whence they came!"
 flavor_fra.206.a:0 "We shall be victorious!"

 #Events 
 flavor_mng.27.t:0 "A Steadfast Defender"
 flavor_mng.27.d:0 "In our hour of need against our deadly foes, one man rose to the challenge of defending our capital and saving our dynasty from perishing in the books of history. Yu Qian, a humble officer in our military court, took charge of the defensive line around our capital and repelled droves of enemies for weeks, till reinforcements arrived."
 flavor_mng.27.a:1 "He is due for a promotion."
 flavor_mng.27.b:1 "His tactics shall be studied by our future commanders."
 flavor_mng.27.c:0 "Elevate his legend in the books of our history."

 flavor_mng.28.t:0 "The Great [Root.GetName]'s Supervisory Agency"
 flavor_mng.28.d:0 "The Censorate is a highly effecting and influential branch of our government, alongside the Six Ministries and the five Chief Military Commissions. Its primary role is to be the eyes and ears of the emperor as well as provide detailed reports on the palatial conduct of various bureaucrats, exposing corruption with valor and a strong moral compass. Recently, refined administrative capabilities have allowed us to further expand the influence of one aspect of the Censorate's responsibilities, further ensuring the stable conduct of our subjects."
 flavor_mng.28.a:0 "The §GPalace Branch§! to enforce the conduct code will be of great use."
 flavor_mng.28.b:0 "The §YAdmonishment Branch§! to maintain proper procedures in accordance to divine law."

 flavor_mng.28.e:0 "None shall be favored."
 
 
 flavor_mng.29.t:0 "Absolutism in the Ming Empire"
 flavor_mng.29.d:0 "Various dynasties have long ruled our home regions. All of them failed at harnessing the true power withheld in it due to the sheer size of our domain. However, for the first time in the books of history our dynasty may now proclaim that our domain truly answers to our Emperor and his undisputed authority, attributed mostly to the rise of absolutism and the weakening of internal factions within our realm."
 flavor_mng.29.a:0 "The Emperor reigns supreme!"
 
 flavor_mng.30.t:0 "Keju"
 flavor_mng.30.d:0 "Careful selection of bureaucrats and administrators is a vital process for an empire with our size. To sate our need for capable and shrewd individuals, we have refined the imperial examination system - also known as Keju - to suit the needs of our dynasty. The exams are a certain path to ensuring all our bureaucrats are familiar with writing etiquette, Chinese literary classics and various styles among state officials. This shared conduct will serve to cement our nation and promote unity, as well as the promotion of the meritocratic ideal that outlines the cornerstones of the founding of our dynasty. The examination system will therefore go on to play a significant role in tempering the power of hereditary aristocracy and military authority, and in the rise of a gentry class of scholar-bureaucrats."
 flavor_mng.30.a:0 "The best of the best for the service of the Emperor!"
 
 flavor_mng.31.t:0 "Evolution of the Tributary System"
 flavor_mng.31.d:0 "Tribute is no stranger between the Emperor of China and his subjects. However, as with all things, time brings change and innovation in the way we exchange power and tribute with lords and chiefs under our protection. Recent changes in the diplomatic conduct that traces the responsibilities of both parties involved has paved the way to strong-arm subject nations into paying increased tribute!"
 flavor_mng.31.a:0 "Times are a-changing!"
 
 flavor_mng.32.t:0 "Climbing Mount Paektu"
 flavor_mng.32.d:0 "Standing between the lands of Korea and the Jurchen wild tribes, Paektu is a mountain of unparalleled natural beauty as it guards the entrance to fresh waters and magnificent flora. At the same time, its slopes are home to religious significance and worship due to the fact that it was the birthplace of Dangun, the founder of Gojoseon, Korea's first dynasty."
 flavor_mng.32.a:0 "A gift to build upon our friendship!"
 flavor_mng.32.b:0 "The nomadic era comes to a fruitful end..."
 
 flavor_mng.33.t:1 "The Karma Kagyu School and the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Dynasty"
 flavor_mng.33.d:0 "One of the largest lineages within the Kagyu school and one of the four major schools of thought that follow Tibetan Buddhism, the Karma Kagyu play a profound role in the internal politics between the slopes of the mountains of our homeland. Despite our seclusion, the ever-reaching influence of the Chinese Emperor finds itself knocking on our door, demanding submission and recognition of his authority within our realm."
 flavor_mng.33.a:0 "We recognize the magnanimity of the Mandate holder!"
 flavor_mng.33.b:0 "Risking our independence? Such nonsense!"
 
 flavor_mng.34.t:0 "The Grand Canals of China"
 flavor_mng.34.d:0 "Canals spanning the width of entire rivers are but some of the engineering marvels our capable planners have put forth to tame the currents that run through the heart of our country. Coupled with dikes across the Yellow River these canals will water and provide our people with ample resources to propel our dynasty to new heights of prosperity and a higher standard of living."
 flavor_mng.34.a:0 "A marvel of modern engineering!"
 
 flavor_mng.35.t:0 "Yellow River Dikes"
 flavor_mng.35.d:0 "Along the Grand Canals that maintain the flow of life-precious water across the heart of our realm, dikes across the Yellow River may assist our farmers and prospecting merchants in harnessing the tide and power of one of nature's elements. Given that rivers in China have an unpredictable nature, we would best be on guard for future floods and try to mitigate these disasters by maintaining our dikes."
 flavor_mng.35.a:0 "Time and tide wait for no man!"
 
 flavor_mng.36.t:0 "The Great Tax Reform"
 flavor_mng.36.d:0 "For centuries, tax collection was a daily nightmare for our provincial governors and administrators. However, recent advancements in bureaucratic efficiency have paved the way for us to introduce a nation-wide tax reform based entirely on silver. Despite advocates who signaled trouble ahead due to overreliance on precious metals, this policy may prove pivotal for our prosperity."
 flavor_mng.36.a:0 "One standard! One nation!"
 
 flavor_mng.37.t:0 "Envoy to the Court of the Hermit Kingdom"
 flavor_mng.37.d:0 "The histories and interactions of Korea and our nation have been intertwined since time immemorial.

 flavor_mng.37.a:0 "Together our great nations will prosper as one."
 
 flavor_mng.38.t:1 "True [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] of Heaven"
 flavor_mng.38.d:1 "The concept of the Mandate of Heaven is one riddled with stories of success and bitter demise, heartfelt mystery and stark revelations. It has seen to the rise and fall of some of our region's most formidable and terrifying empires. However, none has ever encompassed the essence of Heaven to such a perfected degree, as [Root.Monarch.GetName], a beacon of light in a sea of utter darkness."
 flavor_mng.38.a:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] truly captivates the will and flow of the universe."
 
 flavor_mng.39.t:0 "Diplomacy with the Emperor of China"
 flavor_mng.39.d:0 "Our relationship with the Emperors of China has not always been stable. However, a good administrator and diplomat may know when to bow their head so as to not lose it. To that end, we have recently greeted a delegation of the Chinese Emperor within our court, demanding our subjugation to the superiority as dictated by the Heavens themselves."
 flavor_mng.39.a:0 "We gladly accept."
 flavor_mng.39.b:0 "Never!"
 
 flavor_mng.40.t:0 "The Eastern and Western Bureaus"
 flavor_mng.40.d:0 "Powerful imperial bodies have always orchestrated and commanded influence and power in palatial affairs. To satisfy the need of staying vigilant against internal threats, many of our advisors have proposed the founding of one such imperial body, dedicated entirely to managing palatial intrigue and clearing out imperial corruption."
 flavor_mng.40.a:0 "Found the Western Bureau."
 flavor_mng.40.b:0 "Found the Eastern Bureau."
 flavor_mng.40.c:0 "The Emperor's eye sees all..."
 
 flavor_mng.41.t:0 "The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing"
 flavor_mng.41.d:0 "A beautiful pagoda which began construction during the 15th century, the Porcelain tower of Nanjing is a testament to our country's cultivation of religious beliefs and impeccable architecture. Standing tall and ornate, overseeing the rooftops of [1821.GetName], the tower is an important religious symbol of our vast domain."
 flavor_mng.41.a:0 "A beautiful by-product of our spiritual culture."
 
 flavor_mng.42.t:0 "The Current State of Ming Affairs"
 flavor_mng.42.d:0 "Nearly a century after the rise of the Ming dynasty, we now span over the entire domain of the former masters of China. The fruits of our conquests are ample, granting us access to the imperial treasury and in turn utilizing it to further the prosperity of our people. However, cracks are beginning to show across our vast realm. Our inability to properly delegate our authority within our provinces, coupled with the rise of neighboring threats to the North and the incapability of our current Emperor are some of the alarming signs during our times. We must reform our government, maintain Heaven's favor and ensure the continuation of our dynasty as the eternal rulers of China."
 flavor_mng.42.a:0 "The Heavens are testing our great Empire..."
 
 flavor_mng.43.t:0 "Governmental Purges in the Empire of China"
 flavor_mng.43.d:0 "The cycle of life and death is true for all things, including bureaucracy. For far too long elements within our government have enjoyed the Emperor's favor and wealth, enriching themselves and spreading their corruption upon anything they touch. We would best limit and crack down on these rogue bureaucrats lest their influence grows too large!"
 flavor_mng.43.a:0 "The Eunuchs must know their place!"
 flavor_mng.43.b:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
 
 flavor_mng.44.t:0 "Grand Pronouncements of the [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_mng.44.d:0 "The voice of the Emperor must be far-reaching, given our enormous domain. In order to shape our administration and make legislative proclamation, our monarchs frequently use grand pronouncements. Bearing the seal of the Emperor and carried by official delegates, these documents hold immense value. Thus, to ensure the safe and tranquil performance of our government, our great head of state has decided to utilize these pronouncements in order to enforce transparency in..."

 flavor_mng.44.g:0 "... all of them! None shall be spared."
 
 flavor_mng.45.t:0 "Expanding the Jinyiwei"
 flavor_mng.45.d:0 "Also known as the Embroidered Uniform Guard, the Jinyiwei serve the Emperor as the branch of secret police. According to previous decrees issued, their jurisdiction overrules that of judicial proceedings in prosecutions with complete autonomy in apprehending, interrogating and delegating punishment to anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives. However difficult their task may be, it would be sensible to empower their influence and give them the necessary tools to preserve order within our borders.  "
 flavor_mng.45.a:0 "This is sound policy."
 flavor_mng.45.b:0 "Let's not upset current affairs."

 flavor_mng.48.a:0 "Not again..."
 
 flavor_mng.50.t:0 "The Gang of Eight"
 flavor_mng.50.d:1 "Eunuch circles have at times accumulated much influence in both external and internal affairs.

Going by the title 'Eight Tigers', these Eunuchs aim at controlling the court and crushing all opposing factions within the Empire."

 flavor_mng.55.t:0 "The Haijin Policy of the Great Ming"
 flavor_mng.55.d:0 "China has always been a lucrative market for foreigners.

 flavor_mng.56.t:0 "Trade Relations between Japan and China"
 flavor_mng.56.d:0 "Throughout our common history, the Chinese Emperor has always been an ardent supporter of engaging in trade within our domain.

 flavor_mng.56.a:0 "We must grant access to the Chinese merchants."
 flavor_mng.56.b:0 "Forget about it!"
 MNG_PRESENCE_IN_JAPAN:0 "Powerful Presence in the Japanese Markets"
 
 flavor_mng.57.t:0 "The Eunuchs of the [Root.GetName] Empire"
 flavor_mng.57.d:1 "Few institutions during our reign have had as much influence as the Eunuchs behind our Emperor. For better or worse, these elements hold considerable influence and at times project their own agenda, even overriding the will of the Emperor himself. Many advisors in our court voice their distaste for these practices, and urge us to curb the Eunuch influence..."
 flavor_mng.57.a:0 "Their power must be curbed!"
 flavor_mng.57.a.tt: "This will affect the requirements of the mission '§YCornerstone of an Empire§!'."

 estate_disasters.19.d:0 "Recent developments in internal affairs coupled with the failure of our Emperor to rein in the various elements within our court, have given rise to a new faction, threatening to depose our dynasty and seize control of the throne of China.

However, the Christians have come out of the fight in far worse state, with Władysław III of Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania dead. Both Poland and Hungary find themselves in the chaos of an interregnum. Inshallah, their misfortunes will continue. Our victory has shaken Europe and the Christendom to their very core, and all tremble before the might of the Sublime Ottoman State. None will dare lift a finger as we sweep our way through the Balkans. Serbia will be ours. Wallachia will be ours.

An ally is needed if the Habsburg are to be stopped.\n\nAs fate would have it, such potential ally has found his way to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court. A diplomat from the [FRA.GovernmentName] of France reached out to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] on behest of his ruler, [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName].

This record was described as "the largest single cycle of religious painting in Islamic art" by contemporaries. It consists of 814 miniatures which are expertly depicted.

 flavor_tur.286.desc:0 "The Devshirme System has proven its value over the years as it served as the main source of new Janissary recruits for our armies. However, as time went on, the system has been increasingly ignored as Muslim families smuggled their own children in it in favor for a better future for them. Nowadays, the Devshirme is no more but a name of a past way of conscription.\nIt is apparent that reformations are much needed. The conservative side of the government is in favor of overhauling it while the military staff is in favor of abolishing it entirely and introducing a more general conscription."

As military reforms were met with armed resistance, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] forced to decimate the Janissaries.\n\nThough gruesome as it was, the eradication of the Janissary conspirators allowed the [Root.GovernmentName] to reform the military from the ground up. The Janissary corps have been replaced with the Mansure Army, which uses Western strategies, tactics and equipment to fight for their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

Eventually though, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Grand Vizier managed to come to an understanding with the Janissary corps.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] convinced the aghas of the Janissaries of their new position as an official class in the society, which allows each member to be promoted to the positions of a noble or merchant. Though not as convenient as the previous privileges, this hierarchical change in the estates opens opportunities for the Janissaries who do not wish to serve as soldiers while the ones who are born for the fight can return to their actual duties."

Yet, it was an inconsistent system and the laws of each province differed vastly in the millet court when compared to its neighbors. Some clever pashas used this to their advantage to expand their power over their governed region far beyond of what they are supposed to rule. With the standardization of the millet, the treatment of our subjects should be consistent in all corners of the empire."

The wise advisor wishes to not end as an executed man just because he could not stop laughing about the sight he has to behold. "Speak, my most trusted vizier. You say our men found this flag while marching through the province of Taungoo?" The Grand Vizier replies self-controlled and in a few words. He observes [Root.Monarch.GetName] who seems upmost delighted about the flag of the Taungoo dynasty: a white flag with a stylized peacock in its center. Though unique, the vizier is not all too impressed by it. Many nations which fell before [Root.GetUsableName] had unique flags after all.\nWhat in Allah's name is fascinating about it?, the vizier contemplates while [Root.Monarch.GetName] bursts with enthusiasm. "Vizier, inform my court. We shall move to Istaungoo and set there our capital! I want to see these fabled peacocks myself!"\n\nThat was even for the most stoic advisor too much.

His early life has been shaped by neglect and offense from the plotting boyars. At the age of sixteen, Ivan has been crowned as the 'Tsar of All the Russians' and has solidified the official formation of the Russian Tsardom - a realm which has existed already de facto during the reign of his grandfather, Ivan III 'the Great'.\n\nDespite his title would suggest, Ivan's first years of reign are characterized by their peaceful reforms and modernization. The nature of his reign changed when Ivan was thought to be fatally ill and the boyars refused to swear allegiance to his infant son. Ever since, Ivan fostered a paranoid grudge against the boyars which eventually led to the Massacre of Novgorod.\n\nIf he is designated as the heir to the Tsardom, many are sure that the Tsardom would achieve its greatest - even if it is at the cost of the one or other city."

The unification of the country under our hand established a very prosperous shogunate, but His Majesty the Emperor still resides in his palace. Other Emperors have tried in the past to put themselves back at the front of the government, and one even succeeded for a while, so that's a constant potential of threat to our authority we must keep in mind.

 jap_miyadaiku_method_title:0 "Miyadaiku Method"
 jap_miyadaiku_method_desc:0 "The traditional techniques of Japanese carpentry are the pride of our artisans. Constructing the most impressive buildings only with wooden joints and without the use of a single nail amazes any foreigner that lays their eyes upon them, but it's precisely those techniques passed down for generations that have allowed those same buildings to keep standing for centuries. If we promote these artisans, our country will keep standing for more centuries to come."

 flavor_jap.62.d:0 "The city of [4815.GetName], meaning Lion City and called Temasek in the past, rose as an important trading city for the different Malay and Javanese sea kingdoms and empires. It even served as the capital of the kingdom of Singapura, from which it later took the name. Situated at a crucial choke point of the trade flow between China and India, it has seen merchants and products from all places constantly come and go.\n\nHe who controls it, and the commerce that flows through it, will be able to be the one that controls the trade between the East and the West, benefiting greatly from both sides of it."
 flavor_jap.62.a:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."
 
 flavor_jap.63.t:0 "The Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.63.d:0 "The Edo Period, historically starting in 1603 with the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, marks a time of great stability, prosperity and economic growth for Japan. Finally free of internal struggles and constant civil wars, Japanese focus shifted instead towards the development not only of the economy but also of the arts and sciences. The increase in population saw also an increase in urbanization, which furthered such developments even more.\n\nThe period saw the creation and proliferation of new financial policies, new painting techniques like the ukiyo-e or new entertaining activities like the geisha or the kabuki and even new kinds of dishes like sushi or tempura. They all flourished during the Edo Period and became a staple of the Japanese culture recognized as such all over the world.\n\nWith this unprecedented period of stability, development and growth, our country is sure to be able to reach heights never before imagined."
 flavor_jap.63.a:0 "The struggles of the past are now behind us."
 
 flavor_jap.64.t:0 "Fate of the Mandate"
 flavor_jap.64.d:0 "Our country has always lived under the shadow of China. The big Dragon has always considered itself to be the center of the world and rightful ruler of all its territory by the Mandate of the Heaven itself. In the past we had been forced to accept these preposterous claims, but the Tiger has awakened, and it will obey the Dragon no more!\n\nIf there's a country that can claim to be instructed by Heaven itself to rule these lands it can be no other than our Divine Nation. We could take the throne of China for ourselves as it is, with all its associated bureaucracy, or let it die under the weight of a clearly superior and truly divinely authorized rule."

 flavor_jap.65.d:0 "For far too long has our Divine Emperor been outshined by the military dictatorship of the Shogun. For far too long has His Divine Blood been relegated to linger in the shadows. Fortunately for us, unlike His ancestor the Sun Goddess Amaterasu did when She secluded Herself inside the cave, depriving the world of light, He didn't resign himself to living unfruitfully imprisoned inside the Imperial Palace. Instead, He toiled continuously, using His influences to secure favors and support.\n\nWith time, He managed to secure enough support to be able to force the Shogun to abolish the shogunate and re-instate the Imperial Line as the effective ruler of Japan. With a Living Kami again at the forefront of the country, our nation will once again enjoy divine prosperity."
 flavor_jap.65.a:0 "We have waited for far too long!"
 
 flavor_jap.66.t:0 "The Book of Five Rings"
 flavor_jap.66.d:0 "Our country has given rise to many warriors of renown, but none has gained as much persistent fame as the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Being called the best duelist of the history of Japan, he won his first duel at the age of thirteen, and started travelling and participating in duels around the whole country, remaining undefeated.\n\nHis experiences are transmitted through his 'Book of Five Rings', in which he explains all his martial arts techniques, mentality and philosophy. In its pages there's invaluable knowledge in the way of becoming the perfect warrior, and our armies could benefit a lot from reading it."
 flavor_jap.66.a:0 "These teachings will improve our §Yland army§!."
 flavor_jap.66.b:0 "Discard them, focus on the §Msea§! instead!"
 
 flavor_jap.67.t:0 "Of Spice and Herbs"
 flavor_jap.67.d:0 "Advisors, scholars, poets and even politicians have all taken part on the latest grand debate that's shaking the nation. Unlike the usual grim matters of war or poverty that afflict and take up the desks of our hierarchy, lately the question on everyone's mind is: Spice or Herbs? Certainly both sides have strong arguments for their case. Spices definitely have the extra flavor to make our food and drink have that special taste and kick whilst the tea and other herbs dutifully possess their healing as well as calming properties which have been with our nation for centuries."
 flavor_jap.67.a:0 "I love me some spice ..."
 flavor_jap.67.b:0 "... but herbs is where it's at!"
 
 flavor_jap.68.t:0 "The First Geisha"
 flavor_jap.68.d:0 "A Geisha (or Geiko) is a person of arts, essentially a performing female artist. As coin poured into the treasuries of Japan, a growing part of it was funneled into culture and entertainment. The most common form of entertainment in the pleasure districts, performed by men and women alike, was dancing and singing accompanied by instruments and teenage dancing girls called odoriko. When these girls grew up they adopted different names to continue working, one of these names being 'geisha'.\n\nIn time, geisha became to be appreciated for their art with song, dances and the shamisen, and became specialized in these kinds of entertainment."
 flavor_jap.68.a:0 "Such refinement and sophistication!"
 
 flavor_jap.69.t:0 "Poetry and Songs of the Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.69.d:0 "The prosperity of the Edo period allowed for an equal development and maturity of culture and entertainment, and especially many forms of theater and music appeared. Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened. A specific style of music and metric was created during this time, named kouta or kinsei kouta-cho, and it was so influential that it still persists in folk music to this day. It was a style of music for the shamisen, a banjo-like instrument, designed to accompany the singing of a poem or a story.\n\nPoetry also went through its own period of development, with traditional styles being revived and expanded, and new ones being created. It was very common to write poetry in collaboration with other people while alternating stanzas, and even ordinary citizens began participating in that. The starting stanza of the chain began to be perceived as a poem in itself, which with time gave rise to the haiku.\n\nOld pond;\nfrog leaps in;\nwater sound."
 flavor_jap.69.a:0 "What a display of beauty and intellect."
 
 flavor_jap.70.t:0 "Way of Chonindo"
 flavor_jap.70.d:0 "Chonindo is a distinct culture that arose in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido (way of the warrior) qualities —diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality— while blending Shinto, Neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts. For the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture."
 flavor_jap.70.a:0 "What a time to be alive!"
 
 flavor_jap.71.t:0 "Great Fire of Meireki"
 flavor_jap.71.d:0 "Started by a priest who allegedly was attempting to burn a cursed kimono, the Great Fire of Meireki decimated [1028.GetName] and claimed over 100,000 lives. Due to the nature of the buildings in [1028.GetName], which are made of wood and paper, the fire that started in the Hongo District quickly spread throughout the city. Sadly, the fact that we chose to construct our buildings so close to one another played a significant part in the fast spread of the fiery destruction."
 flavor_jap.71.a:0 "What a tragedy."
 
 flavor_jap.72.t:0 "Kanda Matsuri Festivals in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 flavor_jap.72.d:0 "The origins of the Kanda Matsuri were at 1600 when Tokugawa Ieyasu's forces won the Battle of Sekigahara. Victory celebrations were continued throughout the prosperous Edo period, the festivities go on for a week, but the two main days are on the weekend. Saturday is mainly dedicated to parades and Sunday is the shrine procession. Kanda Matsuri is one of the three great Shinto festivals of Edo, along with the Fukagawa Matsuri and Sanno Matsuri, and it will continue to be held to celebrate our glorious victories and show our nations prosperity and prestige! "
 flavor_jap.72.a:0 "A celebration of our proudest victories!"
 
 flavor_jap.73.t:0 "Onna-Musha in the Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.73.d:0 "Originally serving as female bushi, the Onna-musha were esteemed warriors in the early days of our Empire. They were members of the samurai class in feudal Japan and were trained in the use of weapons to protect their household, family, and honor in times of war. Over time, they distinguished themselves in the battlefield as able commanders, scoring impressive victories and cementing their names in the books of history.\n\nHowever, because of the influence of Edo neo-Confucianism, the status of the Onna-musha began diminishing significantly. The function of Onna-musha changed in addition to their husbands. Samurai were no longer concerned with battles and war, they were bureaucrats. Women, specifically daughters of most upper class households, were soon pawns to dreams of success and power. The roaring ideals of fearless devotion and selflessness were gradually replaced by quiet, passive, civil obedience. Despite this, many still wish to serve the nation's military forces as commanders and humbly request to be allowed to lay their lives in service of our country's noble cause. One notable example of the female bushi icons is Ohori Tsuruhime. She has courageously been to battle several times and her claim to divine inspiration coupled with fighting skills has led to her being compared with the likes of Joan of Arc. Her legacy will surely establish her as one of the most recognizable female warriors in Japanese history."
 flavor_jap.73.a:0 "Allow the onna-musha to continue operating."
 flavor_jap.73.b:0 "Their era has ended, they will serve as pawns of power and mandate bureaucracy!"

 flavor_spa.18.t:0 "The Infantes of Aragon"
 flavor_spa.18.d:1 "The Infantes of Aragon are the sons and daughters of king Fernando I of Aragon and his wife Leonor de Alburquerque, who established the Trastámara dynasty in that kingdom after the Compromise of Caspe in 1412. They are also cousins of the Castilian king Juan II and conspired since early in his reign to control him and seize power in Castile, with the support of a faction of relatives and allies among the Castilian nobility. However, they were opposed by another faction headed by the Royal Constable Álvaro de Luna, who became the main support of king Juan II for two decades.\n\nThe situation deteriorated from 1437 when a new civil war broke out between the faction headed by the Infantes of Aragon, and the one headed by Álvaro de Luna and the heir to the throne Enrique, which came to a resolution at the Battle of Olmedo in [GetYear]."
 flavor_spa.18.a:0 "We stand with the King!"

 flavor_spa.20.a:0 "This disastrous situation is over, for better or worse..."
 flavor_spa.22.t:0 "The Spanish Dollar"
 flavor_spa.22.d:1 "The monetary system in Castile in the second half of the 15th century was in chaos. The maravedí, the main currency of account, had been continually devalued since the 13th century. In addition, there were different regional currencies in the Iberian kingdoms, which complicated the economics of the political unification initiated by the wedding of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\n For this reason, a monetary reform was initiated in [GetYear], establishing a new gold coin, the ducat, and a new silver coin, the real, for use in both kingdoms. Given the unexpectedly large influx of silver coming from the Americas in the following decades, the use of the 'real de a ocho', which soon became widely known as the 'Spanish dollar', skyrocketed. It is considered the first global currency, since it was accepted by merchants all over the world, from Africa to America and from Europe to Asia."
 flavor_spa.22.a:0 "Show me the Spanish Dollars!"
 flavor_spa.23.t:0 "San Lorenzo de El Escorial"
 flavor_spa.23.d:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], monarch of [Root.GetName], has many nicknames. But one of the most accurate is “the Bureaucrat King”. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has decided to establish a fixed capital, putting an end to the ancient tradition of the Iberian kings to travel continuously. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has chosen Madrid because of its central position, not being dependent of any great lord or the Church, and some would say because of its good water supply. In any case, [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not like the city itself, so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] also has decided to build a large monastery on its mountainous outskirts, dedicated to Saint Lawrence, which would also be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] habitual residence. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has gathered a large library and relics of saints there, and has turned it into the nerve center of the administration, presiding over the daily meetings of the different councils that deal with government affairs. Finally, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has also established the royal family pantheon there, where all the Kings and Queens of [Root.GetName] after [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be buried."

In [GetYear], he is preparing to set sail with a fleet of five ships and approximately 270 men to find a new route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. His goal is to discover the passage that would go on to allow his ships to sail through the southern tip of South America and enter the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMagellan's journey may be fraught with difficulties, including starvation and battles with indigenous peoples, but he plans to eventually reach the East Indies, and come back through the Cape of Good Hope. Magellan's achievement shall pave the way for future explorers and traders to navigate the globe and open up new opportunities for European colonization and trade in the Americas and Asia."

This emphasis on militarization helped Prussia become one of the strongest powers in Europe and allowed it to successfully defend itself against its enemies and expand its territories. The Prussian army became a model for other European powers, and its tactics and organizational structure were widely imitated.
