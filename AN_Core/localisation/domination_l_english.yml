Our play at legitimizing ourselves as the overlords of Italy via the support of the great European powers will soon take hold. As a result, we have already been granted ownership of North Italy. It is time we prepare our next diplomatic move."
 flavor_fra.116.a:0 "This is the way forward for Catholicism and the unification of Italy!"
 
 flavor_fra.117.t:0 "Cooperating with the Holy Father"
 flavor_fra.117.d:0 "Our ties with the Holy See have given way to new levels of cooperation between our two nations. With trust, mutual respect and access to each other's resources we are ready to tackle all foes and rivals that may wish to obstruct our divine right to glory and the realization of our imperial dreams. Thus, we have the ability to direct our research efforts of both our departments towards our desired outcome."
 flavor_fra.117.a:0 "Let us work together on administration."

 flavor_fra.117.c:0 "We shall prepare and study the matters of war."
 
 flavor_fra.118.t:0 "Early Opera Flourishes"
 flavor_fra.118.d:0 "The first opera plays took place within our borders as our influence in Italy grew and expanded. Artists with exemplary performances, praises the divine, the humane and the royal line are first to produce what is now an era-defining trend across all houses of art and culture in Europe!"
 flavor_fra.118.a:0 "What a performance, my dear!"
 
 flavor_fra.119.t:1 "The French Signoria of Genoa"
 flavor_fra.119.d:0 "For far too long have the governors of Genoa enjoyed autonomy from the French crown. The Signoria had always been very close to the French crown for both political and financial reasons however it is time we solidify our relations and use their coin and wealth to further push our Italian agenda."
 flavor_fra.119.a:1 "They are now a proper part of our domain!"
 
 flavor_fra.120.t:0 "Treaty of the Golden Bulls"
 flavor_fra.120.d:0 "Battle after battle, conquest after conquest. The bond between us and the French crown has only grown as time went on, to that of a familiar robust friendship. Thanks to them, we now control substantial portions of our home region in Italy, and the time has come to take our relationship one step further, according to both our advisors and the agreements we signed with the French ruler."
 flavor_fra.120.a:0 "Together as one!"
 flavor_fra.120.b:0 "Never!"
 
 flavor_fra.121.t:0 "The Heirs of Charlemagne"
 flavor_fra.121.d:1 "Centuries ago, a legendary Frankish emperor struck fear in the heart of his enemies. Now, once more the royal line on France's throne has come to press this claim as the rightful heirs of Charlemagne and demand the immediate abdication of the Holy Roman Empire throne to them! What madness is this that motivates them to even conceive such outlandish claims!?"
 flavor_fra.121.a:0 "We must abdicate the Emperorship"
 flavor_fra.121.b:0 "Use imperial means to impose sanctions upon the French!"
 flavor_fra.121.c:0 "Counter their claims!"
 
 flavor_fra.200.t:0 "The French Alliance Prevails"
 flavor_fra.200.d:0 "We have succeeded in dispelling the evil that treaded the Germanic lands! After countless hard-fought battles and an abundant shedding of blood, our foes are no more! None shall henceforth dispute our claim as the masters of the Germanic people as we carve our name in the books of history with golden letters."
 flavor_fra.200.a:0 "In this hour, no darkness shall endure!"
 
 flavor_fra.201.t:0 "Protectors of the Empire"
 flavor_fra.201.d:0 "We have finally achieved our rightful place among the legends of our time, the throne once taken from us is now back with its rightful owners, the French royal line! Unlike our predecessors, we shall not slacken our duties to preserve the Empire and provide protection to its many and diverse inhabitants!"
 flavor_fra.201.a:0 "We are the shield of the Empire!"
 
 flavor_fra.202.t:0 "The Rade of the Toulon Arsenal"
 flavor_fra.202.d:0 "The word rade comes from the old English term 'Road' "a protected place near shore, not so enclosed as a harbor, where ships can ride at anchor." The Rade of Toulon is one of the best natural anchorages on the Mediterranean, and the largest rade in Europe. It is protected from the sea by the peninsula of Giens and the peninsula of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, and has been used as a military harbor since the 15th century. The Rade shelters the port of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, the port of La Seyne-sur-Mer, as well as the arsenal, or military port of Toulon, and the commercial port.\n\nThe early modern history of the port began when [Root.Monarch.GetName] built his Tour Royale at Toulon in [GetYear]. A naval arsenal and shipyard were built simultaneously, and small a sheltered harbour, the Veille Darse, was built a few years later to protect ships from the wind and sea. The shipyard was greatly enlarged by a later Cardinal, who wished to make Provence into a Mediterranean naval power."
 flavor_fra.202.a:0 "Let it be built!"
 
 flavor_fra.203.t:0 "The French Isles"
 flavor_fra.203.d:0 "Our greatest foe, the royal line in the Isles, has perished. In their stead, they left an economy in shambles, a headless people led astray, without a voice to guide them. Despite our rivalry, it would be wise to consider integrating them into our administration. Alternatively, we would have every right to enforce their conformity to our rules and customs."
 flavor_fra.203.a:0 "Let us integrate them in our administration."
 flavor_fra.203.b:0 "France reigns supreme!"
 
 flavor_fra.204.t:0 "La Sorbonne"
 flavor_fra.204.d:0 "The university of Paris is by far not the only scientific institute in [Root.GetName] of the year [GetYear]. While our land hosts a great many such forums of thought, la Sorbonne, as the Paris University is called, is by far the most celebrated and illustrious of them all. Originally built during the 13th century, recent extensive renovations have breathed valuable life into the faculty, allowing it to expand its halls, curriculum and prestige alongside the other universities in our land!"
 flavor_fra.204.a:1 "Hic et ubique terrarum! (Here and anywhere on Earth)"

 flavor_fra.205.t:0 "The Holy Lands of Jerusalem"
 flavor_fra.205.d:0 "Time and time again the Catholic world attempted to liberate Jerusalem and protect the city and its inhabitants from heathen attacks. However, despite praying and utilizing scores of men as well as several Crusades, our people were never sufficiently successful. Despite that, recent progress in the Levant has granted us the right to proclaim the resurrection of the legendary crusader kingdom under the French banner, God wills it!"
 flavor_fra.205.a:0 "Their banner shall fly once more!"
 flavor_fra.205.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful ruler of the holy lands!"
  
 flavor_fra.206.t:0 "The Hundred Years War in France"
 flavor_fra.206.d:0 "The Hundred Years War begun in 1337 due to a dispute between our throne and the English house of Plantagenet. During the past century, the war grew in scale and scope, enveloping at times various factions of Western Europe. Recently, the tide has turned, granting our troops the upper hand in reconquering long-lost land from the accursed English king, who now cowers across the Channel. The coming of Joan of Arc and her legendary valor inspired our nation to push ahead with the war effort despite our then-disadvantaged position. Military leaders like Jean Bureau and Jean de Dunois will certainly route the remaining English influence away from European shores and back from whence they came!"
 flavor_fra.206.a:0 "We shall be victorious!"

 flavor_mng.30.d:0 "Careful selection of bureaucrats and administrators is a vital process for an empire with our size. To sate our need for capable and shrewd individuals, we have refined the imperial examination system - also known as Keju - to suit the needs of our dynasty. The exams are a certain path to ensuring all our bureaucrats are familiar with writing etiquette, Chinese literary classics and various styles among state officials. This shared conduct will serve to cement our nation and promote unity, as well as the promotion of the meritocratic ideal that outlines the cornerstones of the founding of our dynasty.

 flavor_mng.36.t:0 "The Great Tax Reform"
 flavor_mng.36.d:0 "For centuries, tax collection was a daily nightmare for our provincial governors and administrators.

However, cracks are beginning to show across our vast realm. Our inability to properly delegate our authority within our provinces, coupled with the rise of neighboring threats to the North and the incapability of our current Emperor are some of the alarming signs during our times.

 flavor_mng.43.t:0 "Governmental Purges in the Empire of China"
 flavor_mng.43.d:0 "The cycle of life and death is true for all things, including bureaucracy.

 flavor_mng.45.d:1 "Also known as the Embroidered Uniform Guard, the Jinyiwei serve as the pure expression of law and order within the empire. Being the Emperor's secret police, their authority is even above all other forms of the judiciary system. They can arrest and punish anyone them deem an enemy of the state, and not even high ranking nobles or the relatives of the Emperor themselves are out of their reach.

As a result of this, the Shi'ite Turks living in Asia Minor were beginning to get deported into the region of Morea.

Naturally, this claim of Roman succession was also used by Mehmed to justify an invasion of Otranto in 1480 with the further ambition to conquer Rome for the Ottomans.

At the age of sixteen, Ivan has been crowned as the 'Tsar of All the Russians' and has solidified the official formation of the Russian Tsardom - a realm which has existed already de facto during the reign of his grandfather, Ivan III 'the Great'.\n\nDespite his title would suggest, Ivan's first years of reign are characterized by their peaceful reforms and modernization. The nature of his reign changed when Ivan was thought to be fatally ill and the boyars refused to swear allegiance to his infant son. Ever since, Ivan fostered a paranoid grudge against the boyars which eventually led to the Massacre of Novgorod.\n\nIf he is designated as the heir to the Tsardom, many are sure that the Tsardom would achieve its greatest - even if it is at the cost of the one or other city."

The masses stormed the government buildings, dragging out the leaders that not long ago they had followed.

 decadence.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetUsableNameCap] is facing one of its greatest challenges in its administration.

 decadence.8.t:0 "Fall from Grace"
 decadence.8.desc:0 "[Root.GetUsableNameCap] - once the shining beacon of this world and a revered great power. Now nothing but a laughing stock for new rising powers. The [Root.GetAdjective] court is fully aware of the dire situation of the international position of [Root.GetUsableName], yet actions to improve our reputation are yet to be taken..."
 decadence.8.a:0 "Who cares about the opinions of imbeciles anyway?"

 decadence.10.t:0 "Unstable Economy"
 decadence.10.desc:0 "The court of [Root.GetUsableName] is a substantial expense and takes a large amount of the treasury's content. As such, not much is left for the [Root.GetAdjective] economy, which has been experiencing a deterioration for years by now..."

 flavor_jap.62.t:0 "Rise of [4815.GetName]"
 flavor_jap.62.d:0 "The city of [4815.GetName], meaning Lion City and called Temasek in the past, rose as an important trading city for the different Malay and Javanese sea kingdoms and empires. It even served as the capital of the kingdom of Singapura, from which it later took the name. Situated at a crucial choke point of the trade flow between China and India, it has seen merchants and products from all places constantly come and go.\n\nHe who controls it, and the commerce that flows through it, will be able to be the one that controls the trade between the East and the West, benefiting greatly from both sides of it."
 flavor_jap.62.a:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."
 
 flavor_jap.63.t:0 "The Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.63.d:0 "The Edo Period, historically starting in 1603 with the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, marks a time of great stability, prosperity and economic growth for Japan. Finally free of internal struggles and constant civil wars, Japanese focus shifted instead towards the development not only of the economy but also of the arts and sciences. The increase in population saw also an increase in urbanization, which furthered such developments even more.\n\nThe period saw the creation and proliferation of new financial policies, new painting techniques like the ukiyo-e or new entertaining activities like the geisha or the kabuki and even new kinds of dishes like sushi or tempura. They all flourished during the Edo Period and became a staple of the Japanese culture recognized as such all over the world.\n\nWith this unprecedented period of stability, development and growth, our country is sure to be able to reach heights never before imagined."
 flavor_jap.63.a:0 "The struggles of the past are now behind us."
 
 flavor_jap.64.t:0 "Fate of the Mandate"
 flavor_jap.64.d:0 "Our country has always lived under the shadow of China. The big Dragon has always considered itself to be the center of the world and rightful ruler of all its territory by the Mandate of the Heaven itself. In the past we had been forced to accept these preposterous claims, but the Tiger has awakened, and it will obey the Dragon no more!\n\nIf there's a country that can claim to be instructed by Heaven itself to rule these lands it can be no other than our Divine Nation. We could take the throne of China for ourselves as it is, with all its associated bureaucracy, or let it die under the weight of a clearly superior and truly divinely authorized rule."
 flavor_jap.64.a:0 "It's mine and mine alone!"
 flavor_jap.64.b:0 "These petty declarations are beneath us..."
 
 flavor_jap.65.t:0 "House of the Rising Sun"
 flavor_jap.65.d:0 "For far too long has our Divine Emperor been outshined by the military dictatorship of the Shogun. For far too long has His Divine Blood been relegated to linger in the shadows. Fortunately for us, unlike His ancestor the Sun Goddess Amaterasu did when She secluded Herself inside the cave, depriving the world of light, He didn't resign himself to living unfruitfully imprisoned inside the Imperial Palace. Instead, He toiled continuously, using His influences to secure favors and support.\n\nWith time, He managed to secure enough support to be able to force the Shogun to abolish the shogunate and re-instate the Imperial Line as the effective ruler of Japan. With a Living Kami again at the forefront of the country, our nation will once again enjoy divine prosperity."
 flavor_jap.65.a:0 "We have waited for far too long!"
 
 flavor_jap.66.t:0 "The Book of Five Rings"
 flavor_jap.66.d:0 "Our country has given rise to many warriors of renown, but none has gained as much persistent fame as the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Being called the best duelist of the history of Japan, he won his first duel at the age of thirteen, and started travelling and participating in duels around the whole country, remaining undefeated.\n\nHis experiences are transmitted through his 'Book of Five Rings', in which he explains all his martial arts techniques, mentality and philosophy. In its pages there's invaluable knowledge in the way of becoming the perfect warrior, and our armies could benefit a lot from reading it."
 flavor_jap.66.a:0 "These teachings will improve our §Yland army§!."
 flavor_jap.66.b:0 "Discard them, focus on the §Msea§! instead!"
 flavor_jap.66.c:0 "We must consider our options carefully."
 
 flavor_jap.67.t:0 "Of Spice and Herbs"
 flavor_jap.67.d:0 "Advisors, scholars, poets and even politicians have all taken part on the latest grand debate that's shaking the nation. Unlike the usual grim matters of war or poverty that afflict and take up the desks of our hierarchy, lately the question on everyone's mind is: Spice or Herbs? Certainly both sides have strong arguments for their case. Spices definitely have the extra flavor to make our food and drink have that special taste and kick whilst the tea and other herbs dutifully possess their healing as well as calming properties which have been with our nation for centuries."
 flavor_jap.67.a:0 "I love me some spice ..."
 flavor_jap.67.b:0 "... but herbs is where it's at!"
 
 flavor_jap.68.t:0 "The First Geisha"
 flavor_jap.68.d:0 "A Geisha (or Geiko) is a person of arts, essentially a performing female artist. As coin poured into the treasuries of Japan, a growing part of it was funneled into culture and entertainment. The most common form of entertainment in the pleasure districts, performed by men and women alike, was dancing and singing accompanied by instruments and teenage dancing girls called odoriko. When these girls grew up they adopted different names to continue working, one of these names being 'geisha'.\n\nIn time, geisha became to be appreciated for their art with song, dances and the shamisen, and became specialized in these kinds of entertainment."
 flavor_jap.68.a:0 "Such refinement and sophistication!"
 
 flavor_jap.69.t:0 "Poetry and Songs of the Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.69.d:1 "The prosperity of the Edo period allowed for an equal development and maturity of culture and entertainment, and especially many forms of theater and music appeared. The differences between the noble samurai class and the common townsfolk gave rise to specific styles of music and theater, which defined and differentiated themselves the more the classes were set apart. A specific style of music and metric was created during this time, named kouta or kinsei kouta-cho, and it was so influential that it still persists in folk music to this day. It was a style of music for the shamisen, a banjo-like instrument, designed to accompany the singing of a poem or a story.\n\nPoetry also went through its own period of development, with traditional styles being revived and expanded, and new ones being created. It was very common to write poetry in collaboration with other people while alternating stanzas, and even ordinary citizens began participating in that. The starting stanza of the chain began to be perceived as a poem in itself, which with time gave rise to the haiku.\n\nOld pond;\nfrog leaps in;\nwater sound."
 flavor_jap.69.a:0 "What a display of beauty and intellect."
 
 flavor_jap.70.t:0 "Way of Chonindo"
 flavor_jap.70.d:1 "The changes in society after the turbulent times of the Sengoku Jidai are quite obvious. The previous constant struggles across all Japan have finally subsided, and now we enjoy a somewhat stable internal peace which allows a more relaxed life for the common people. As a result, they are flocking to the quickly growing cities, and thus our previously rural population is giving rise to the Chonin (townspeople), and with that their own way of life called Chonindo. Their aspiration towards the samurai class and their values of bushido, together with a keen interest in the development of arts and science have resulted in a distinct new mass culture, focused on a great quality of workmanship. Poetry, performances, puppet-theaters, paintings, and all other forms of art are seeing great expansions."
 flavor_jap.70.a:0 "What a time to be alive!"
 
 flavor_jap.71.t:0 "Great Fire of Meireki"
 flavor_jap.71.d:0 "Started by a priest who allegedly was attempting to burn a cursed kimono, the Great Fire of Meireki decimated [1028.GetName] and claimed over 100,000 lives. Due to the nature of the buildings in [1028.GetName], which are made of wood and paper, the fire that started in the Hongo District quickly spread throughout the city. Sadly, the fact that we chose to construct our buildings so close to one another played a significant part in the fast spread of the fiery destruction."
 flavor_jap.71.a:0 "What a tragedy."
 
 flavor_jap.72.t:0 "Kanda Matsuri Festivals in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 flavor_jap.72.d:1 "After the turbulent times and constant war of the Sengoku Jidai, numerous festivals (matsuri) were established to celebrate peace once it was achieved. One of the most famous ones is the one celebrated in Kanda Myojin in Edo, a shrine popular both among the samurai and the common classes. The numerous floats, mikoshi, and performances that go along the procession really have turned the matsuri into widely acclaimed celebrations, and the focus of city life when they happen."
 flavor_jap.72.a:0 "A celebration of our proudest victories!"
 
 flavor_jap.73.t:0 "Onna-Musha in the Edo Period"
 flavor_jap.73.d:0 "Originally serving as female bushi, the Onna-musha were esteemed warriors in the early days of our Empire. They were members of the samurai class in feudal Japan and were trained in the use of weapons to protect their household, family, and honor in times of war. Over time, they distinguished themselves in the battlefield as able commanders, scoring impressive victories and cementing their names in the books of history.\n\nHowever, because of the influence of Edo neo-Confucianism, the status of the Onna-musha began diminishing significantly. The function of Onna-musha changed in addition to their husbands. Samurai were no longer concerned with battles and war, they were bureaucrats. Women, specifically daughters of most upper class households, were soon pawns to dreams of success and power. The roaring ideals of fearless devotion and selflessness were gradually replaced by quiet, passive, civil obedience. Despite this, many still wish to serve the nation's military forces as commanders and humbly request to be allowed to lay their lives in service of our country's noble cause. One notable example of the female bushi icons is Ohori Tsuruhime. She has courageously been to battle several times and her claim to divine inspiration coupled with fighting skills has led to her being compared with the likes of Joan of Arc. Her legacy will surely establish her as one of the most recognizable female warriors in Japanese history."
 flavor_jap.73.a:0 "Allow the onna-musha to continue operating."
 flavor_jap.73.b:0 "Their era has ended, they will serve as pawns of power and mandate bureaucracy!"

 flavor_spa.18.t:0 "The Infantes of Aragon"
 flavor_spa.18.d:1 "The Infantes of Aragon are the sons and daughters of king Fernando I of Aragon and his wife Leonor de Alburquerque, who established the Trastámara dynasty in that kingdom after the Compromise of Caspe in 1412. They are also cousins of the Castilian king Juan II and conspired since early in his reign to control him and seize power in Castile, with the support of a faction of relatives and allies among the Castilian nobility. However, they were opposed by another faction headed by the Royal Constable Álvaro de Luna, who became the main support of king Juan II for two decades.\n\nThe situation deteriorated from 1437 when a new civil war broke out between the faction headed by the Infantes of Aragon, and the one headed by Álvaro de Luna and the heir to the throne Enrique, which came to a resolution at the Battle of Olmedo in [GetYear]."
 flavor_spa.18.a:0 "We stand with the King!"

 flavor_spa.20.a:0 "This disastrous situation is over, for better or worse..."
 flavor_spa.22.t:0 "The Spanish Dollar"
 flavor_spa.22.d:1 "The monetary system in Castile in the second half of the 15th century was in chaos. The maravedí, the main currency of account, had been continually devalued since the 13th century. In addition, there were different regional currencies in the Iberian kingdoms, which complicated the economics of the political unification initiated by the wedding of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\n For this reason, a monetary reform was initiated in [GetYear], establishing a new gold coin, the ducat, and a new silver coin, the real, for use in both kingdoms. Given the unexpectedly large influx of silver coming from the Americas in the following decades, the use of the 'real de a ocho', which soon became widely known as the 'Spanish dollar', skyrocketed. It is considered the first global currency, since it was accepted by merchants all over the world, from Africa to America and from Europe to Asia."
 flavor_spa.22.a:0 "Show me the Spanish Dollars!"
 flavor_spa.23.t:0 "San Lorenzo de El Escorial"
 flavor_spa.23.d:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], monarch of [Root.GetName], has many nicknames. But one of the most accurate is “the Bureaucrat King”. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has decided to establish a fixed capital, putting an end to the ancient tradition of the Iberian kings to travel continuously. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has chosen Madrid because of its central position, not being dependent of any great lord or the Church, and some would say because of its good water supply. In any case, [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not like the city itself, so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] also has decided to build a large monastery on its mountainous outskirts, dedicated to Saint Lawrence, which would also be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] habitual residence. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has gathered a large library and relics of saints there, and has turned it into the nerve center of the administration, presiding over the daily meetings of the different councils that deal with government affairs. Finally, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has also established the royal family pantheon there, where all the Kings and Queens of [Root.GetName] after [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be buried."

In [GetYear], he is preparing to set sail with a fleet of five ships and approximately 270 men to find a new route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. His goal is to discover the passage that would go on to allow his ships to sail through the southern tip of South America and enter the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMagellan's journey may be fraught with difficulties, including starvation and battles with indigenous peoples, but he plans to eventually reach the East Indies, and come back through the Cape of Good Hope. Magellan's achievement shall pave the way for future explorers and traders to navigate the globe and open up new opportunities for European colonization and trade in the Americas and Asia."

 flavor_brapru.42.d:0 "Our attempts to consolidate our lands in Franconia have come to a disastrous conclusion. After several years of attempts, our situation in lower Germany can only be described as a total failure, and we will soon feel the repercussions of this catastrophe. We were on the verge of greatness..."

 #Stiopa's events 
 flavor_brapru.43.t:0 "Berliner Religiongespräch"
 flavor_brapru.43.d:0 "Numerous theologians and scholars have all gathered in Berlin for a once in a lifetime event. The topic is simple: reconciling the differences of Lutheran and Calvinist theology. We have long since been a bastion of religious freedom in the Empire, providing refuge to those targeted by the Inquisition. Despite this, tensions continue to rise as the people take sides in what has become a Protestant Schism, akin to the splitting of the Roman Church. Hopefully, with this conference there will be peace."
 flavor_brapru.43.a:0 "A great development!"
 flavor_brapru.43.b:0 "The churches can't be united. Waste of time!"
 flavor_brapru.44.t:1 "Das Toleranzedikt"
 flavor_brapru.44.d:1 "As religious tensions grow, it is [Root.GetName]'s job to stifle the ever-growing flame and weather the storm ahead. The Edict of Tolerance, issued by [Root.Monarch.GetName], states that the Lutheran and Reformed Churches are to be treated as equals and the relations between them are to be regulated by law."
 flavor_brapru.44.a:0 "Force the Edict!"
 flavor_brapru.44.b:0 "This will only create more discontent."
 flavor_brapru.45.t:0 "Fate of the Kreditwerk"
 flavor_brapru.45.d:0 "The debts of men and kings cannot go unfinanced. Before the time of pragmatism, simple solutions were key to the administration of nations, and the Kreditwerk is a remnant of such an era. By financing the Margraviate's debt through the estates, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could continue to spend at extortionate interest rates. Perhaps the time has come to neuter this institution once and for all."
 flavor_brapru.45.a:0 "A gruesome institution must meet a gruesome fate"
 flavor_brapru.45.b:0 "Reform the Kreditwerk and make it governmental"
 flavor_brapru.46.t:0 "Humboldt Brothers"
 flavor_brapru.46.d:0 "The Humboldt brothers were Prussian philosophers, linguists, government functionaries, diplomats, and the founders of the Humboldt University of Berlin. Wilhelm von Humboldt, the older brother, focused his studies on the philosophical pursuits of life, presenting himself as an intellectual through and through. Meanwhile, his younger brother Alexander von Humboldt focused his studies on incurring one revolutionary discovery after another. Launching several expeditions into Spanish America, Russia, and the United States, the Humboldt brothers were truly a pair of geniuses."
 flavor_brapru.46.a:0 "The everlasting philosophy of Wilhelm shall guide us."
 flavor_brapru.46.b:0 "The revolutionary discoveries of Alexander will shape the state."
 flavor_brapru.47.t:0 "Of Thaler, Groschen, and Pfennige"
 flavor_brapru.47.d:0 "With the constant ebb and flow of the national money supply, monetary policy is typically bundled up with fiscal policy and left to the estates to manage. As such, the supply of coinage is rarely in a ruler's hands to begin with. With our recent emphasis on controlling the nation's money supply, it is time to choose the direction we intend to take this."
