 angevin_nation_title: "Unite the Crowns of England and France (NIE)"
 angevin_nation_desc: "Long has it been since Henry II of England reigned at the zenith of the Angevin Empire back in the 12th Century. He not only inherited land in the British Isles and Normandy, but also sought to conquer more French land once the marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine was secure. Sadly, his creation did not last, and soon enough the French unified and drove out the English. Perhaps, with a stronger and more robust nation ready to further our ambitions, we can pick up where Henry II left off and reform the Angevin Empire once our claims in the region are secure and France is no more.

 maghreb_nation_title: "Unite the People of the Maghreb (NIE)"
 maghreb_nation_desc: "For so long the people of the Maghreb have been disunited, constantly at war with each other because of politics, religion, culture, or some other matter entirely. There must be something to unite the spread out people of the Maghreb into one formal nation that can withstand attacks from both Christians in the north and growing Levantine, Egyptian, and Turkish influence from the east. If the other states of the Maghreb cannot find the strength to bring peace and unity to the region, then we shall. (This decision is for National Ideas Expanded)"
 russian_republic_nation_title: "Form the Great Russian Republic (NIE)"
 russian_republic_nation_desc: "The work done by our ancestors was not in vein, was it? Establishing the foundations of a proud repbulic generations ago, but still the sword of republican liberty clashes against the blade of traditional monarchy, especially in the lands of the Rus. We must see to it that this age-old battle is won by the side that can secure the most rights for the Russian citizens; with the Veche Republic as a founding part of our people, we can ensure that we see this batlle through to the very end.

 wokou_nation_title: "Formalize the Wokou Pirates (NIE)"
 wokou_nation_desc: "For too long we have been suppressed by the likes of regional powers in China, Korea, and Japan. They seek to claim the waters for themselves, push us to the edge of society, and remove our influence from every facet of Asia in general, yet these ambitions are not yet realized in full. Through deception and ruthless tactics and sustained aggression in the face of bleak times, the Wokou are slowly rising in power. Formalizing them into something more than just a loose group of smugglers and renegade sailors is what is needed now. (This decision is for National Ideas Expanded)"
 north_sea_empire_nation_title: "Restoration of North Sea Hegemony (NIE)"
 north_sea_empire_nation_desc: "Long has it been since we have heard the name 'Danelaw' be used without laughs being heard shortly after; either laughs, or silent whispers of discontent. What was lost so long ago shortly after Cnut the Great, the Danelaw and also hegemony over the entirety of the North Sea, is what we strive to restore to this very day. The lands will not be easy to conquer nor will the English and Scandinavians bow to our flag with ease, but we can see that the ambition of Cnut the Great was one of greatness. We will stop at nothing to see the North Sea Empire revived. (This decision is for National Ideas Expanded)."
 seven_council_fires_nation_title: "Formalize the Seven Council Fires (NIE)"
 seven_council_fires_nation_desc: "The various people that have come together under our leadership, they speak a similar language and share similar customs but they lack the unity that the foreigners do. Those who brought us horses and gunpowder weapons can set an example for how we can formalize ourselves into a proper nation that transcends tribal politics; a nation that is led by councils of people in the form of a confederacy.

 tamil_nation_title: "Tamilakam, Homeland of the Tamils"
 tamil_nation_desc: "Chera, Chola, and Pandya. The three powers that once held sway over Southern India could rarely unify it and utilize the power within the region to its fullest extent. Petty conflicts and civil unrest brought the deaths of many great Tamil rulers and outside threats struck down what upward momentum empires from our lands had. Though threats are still around today and we are not yet safe from foreigners, we are managing to unite the region like in previous times. If we can sustain this pace and conclude a lasting peace in the future, we just might be able to form a united Tamil empire."
 nahua_nation_title: "Unification of the Nahuatl (NIE)"
 nahua_nation_desc: "Much has changed since the ones from far off shores arrived in our lands seeking various riches, land, and people to exploit for their own well being. We have learned from them and taken it upon ourselves to reform many aspects of our society so that we are no longer at a distinct disadvantage. All that remains now is to formally unite the various people around us, from the Aztecs to the Tecos and from the Purepecha to the Mixtec, into one federation. United we will stand tall against our foes. (This decision is for National Ideas Expanded)."
 somali_nation_title: "A Land for Somali People (NIE)"
 somali_nation_desc: "Centuries have gone by as the Somali people tried to make their way in the world. Trading in coastal cities, swearing fealty to various clans, and trying to maintain themselves despite outside influences from Arabia, East Africa, and all across the Red Sea's coast. Though unification to some clans seems unlikely, we need to have faith in our people and our leaders that they can carve out a place fit for the Somali people; a place where they can prosper without internal clan feuds breaking things down and outside forces taking what they want.
