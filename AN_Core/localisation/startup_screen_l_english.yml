 string_start_maghreb:0 "The collapse of the §YAlmohad Caliphate§! in the 13th Century fractured §YIberia§! and the §YMaghreb§! into a multitude of warring states. This period of chaos was a perfect opportunity for the Christian kingdoms to wage their war of ‘Reconquista’, resulting in the annexation of all the Muslim states on the Peninsula with the sole exception of the Emirate of §YGranada§!.\n\nThe §YNasrids§! of §YGranada§! cling to their remaining territory as §YCastile§! makes repeated attempts to end Muslim rule in §YAndalucia§!. Granada cannot face the military might of Castile alone; if it is to survive it will need to make some powerful friends indeed. To add to Granada’s troubles, the Emirate is plagued with internal strife. At present the clearest threat is §YEmir Muhammad’s§! nephew, §YYusuf§!, who has ambitions for the throne and is rapidly gathering support to enforce his claim.\n\nThe §YZayyanids§! of §YTlemcen§! find themselves especially vulnerable. Tlemcen, locked between the stronger powers of §YTunis§! and §YMorocco§!, struggles to even maintain control over the population beyond the city of Tlemcen itself.\n\nThe most powerful of the Maghrebi kingdoms is the Sultanate of Morocco, ruled by the §YMarinid§! dynasty. Though they control a great deal of strategically and economically important territory, the Marinid rulers are little more than puppets of their §YWattasid§! viziers. Many within the Marinid family resent the Wattasid custodianship of Morocco, while the Wattasids themselves all but openly covet the throne for themselves. Being so concerned with internal mistrust, Morocco failed to defend the city of §YCeuta§! from a §YPortuguese§! assault in 1415 and have since been unable to recapture it.\n\nThe §YHasfids§! of Tunis were once governors in the service of the Almohads. When the Caliphate collapsed they continued to rule Tunis and have even awarded themselves the title of Caliph, though the Muslim world at large pays little heed to this bold claim. Of the three large kingdoms on the coast, Tunis is the least beset by internal struggle and is relatively free to make incursions into the surrounding states.\n\nIn the interior, the Berber tribes of §YMzab§!, §YDjerid§!, §YTouggourt§!, and §YFezzan§! all vie for dominance of the desert. Mzab follows the rare Ibadi sect of Islam, and its rulers descend from the Rustamid Imams who ruled a large part of the Maghrebi interior in the 9th Century. Though unlikely candidates to reunite the Maghreb, the nomads of the interior have had a great impact on the fate of North Africa many times in the past."

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, with its survival at stake.\n\nHowever, there's a chance for its rulers to recover the lost greatness, if they manage carefully their sparse resources, and re-establish their authority again upon their neighbours. If they succeed, there will even be the opportunity to take advantage of the increasingly open sea lanes in the West, as the Mansa §YKo Mamadi§!  tried to do in the past."

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, with its survival at stake.\n\nThus, an opportunity arises for the mighty §YSonghai§!, a fighting people that is ready to take the preeminence they think to deserve among its neighbors, and in the Saharan caravan trade.

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, with its survival at stake.\n\nThe §YJolof§! is a Confederacy of divided kingdoms, with a suzerain over all of them sitting in the middle of their kingdoms, that have been loosely part of the Empire of §YMali§!.

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, and its survival is at stake.\n\nThe §YMossi§!, lords of the horses, have occupied the highlands over the Niger river bend for more than a century, raiding their neighbors, and even sacking such a wealthy city as Timbuktu. However, they remain divided in different kingdoms, with their own interests usually at odds. A ruler that could become suzerain over all of them could greatly improve their strength, however, maybe making them a great power in the region, although they will have to overcome their neighbors of §YMali§! and §YSonghai§!"

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, and its survival is at stake.\n\nTo the East, the 7 Hausan city-states have traditionally been at an equilibrium, holding a competitive cooperation among them. However, their potential is great, as they control the Eastern trade routes between the desert, the steppe and the jungle. Should one of them be able to unify a §YHausa§! state, it will become a great contender in the region."

However, internal conflicts have weakened and divided the once mighty Empire, and its survival is at stake.\n\nTo the South, the Yoruba people of §YOyo§! held a position in the forest between the steppe and the jungle, thus becoming middlemen between both regions. That has also allowed them to master the cavalry warfare, which they thoroughly use against their neighbors, allowing them to become a main power to be feared."
 string_start_ethiopia:0 "In the Horn of Africa, the ancient Kingdom of §YEthiopia§!, under the §YSolomonid§! king §YZara Yakob§!, is experiencing a golden age of expansion and inner strength. In many ways this dynamic Empire is dominating the entire region. However, it faces some challenges that need to be tackled. The political system has traditionally been moving around different centers of power all around the Ethiopian highlands, sitting for only one or two reigns in a fixed place, and regional lords held a great share of military and economic power. One of the actions that may be taken by an Ethiopian ruler would be to promote the new §YKawa§! troops, as pacifiers in the realm.\n\nThat would also come at hand in military expansion, as many states view a militant Christian Empire with fear and contempt. The Sultanate of §YAdal§! has been the traditional opponent of the Solomonid kings, and is ready to become the Sword of Islam in this region. To the south, the main power in the Somali coast is the Sultanate of §YAjuuraan§!, which aims to reunite all the Somali clans into one estate, while taking control of the trade routes between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Further down the Nile, the last remnants of the Christian Nubian Kingdoms are fighting for their survival against the §YMamluks§! in the north, as well as the local Muslim tribal federations that have moved into the area."

The Sultanate of §YAdal§! has been the traditional opponent of the Solomonid kings, and is ready to become the Sword of Islam in this region. Placed in a key position in the Red Sea, managing to defeat their Ethiopian foes would allow them to try to control the Bab al-Mandab Strait, its wealthy trade routes, and maybe winning a foothold in Yemen.\n\nTo the south, the main power in the Somali coast is the Sultanate of §YAjuuraan§!, which aims to reunite all the Somali clans into one estate, while taking control of the trade routes between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.

At the same time, its trade focus makes the Gulf of Aden the natural expansion region for the Somali, and maybe allow them to turn their gazes to the East, to the riches of India, and maybe even further, to the place from where the Treasure Fleet of Zheng He came some decades ago."
 string_start_kilwa:0 "In the Eastern coast of Africa, widely known as the Swahili Coast, as that is the lingua franca in the region, the Sultanate of §YKilwa§! is experiencing a Golden Age, as its wealthy capital shows to the foreign merchants that come from all over the Indian Ocean and the inner lands. Having flourished since it was first established centuries ago by Farsi merchants, maybe recovering that connection, through the trade lanes of the Gulfs of Aden and Hormuz, would be a productive investment. There is also a wealthy trade connection with India, that may be strengthened, for the profit of Kilwan merchants and its Sultan. And the future is open to further exploration to the East, from where the Spices come from, and also to the South, as maybe an interesting trade route to the West could be open."
 string_start_mutapa:0 "In the mainland of East Africa, the former great power of Zimbabwe has been decaying for decades. New states are consolidating in the region, the most important being that of the Shona kings of §YMutapa§! , the §YMwenemutapa§!, that is, ‘the Lords of the Land'. They aim to reunite all the territories in the highlands and the river valleys under their control, and make use of the richness coming from the large number of gold mines in the region to reconstruct all the lands formerly held by the kings of Zimbabwe. Their ambition is clearly set: making it Great again."
 string_start_kongo:0 "In the Congo river basin there are a number of powers that aim to create a central authority in that region for the first time in history. The one in the best position to do so is the Kingdom of §YKongo§!, as they control the estuary of the great river, making them wealthy, respected and powerful among their neighbors. Some ships come from the Gulf of Guinea from time to time, eager for trading; who knows if it may be interesting to develop a new trade connection to that region. There has also been a traditional shift about the cults followed by the §YMani Kongo§! and their heirs, with different gods being followed at different moments, so that is also a conduct that may be followed (or not) in the following years."
 string_start_tatars:0 "The §YGolden Horde§! is dead; its §YTatar§! successors fight over its corpse even as their enemies grow strong around them. The once great empire of §YJochi§!, son of §YGenghis Khan§!, has been divided into several Khanates each seeking dominance over the steppe.\n\nThe most direct successor to the Golden Horde is the §YGreat Horde§!. Controlling the cities of Sarai and Astrakhan, Khan Küchük Muhammad pronounces his hegemony over the steppe to deaf ears. The constituent tribes continue to break away from his rule and the Khan has thus far been unable to stop them.\n\nA Khan who is not feared even by his neighbors is barely a Khan at all; once mere tax-collectors, the Grand Principality of §YMuscovy§! has expanded greatly without a strong Khan to keep them in check. If they are left to grow they will surely seek to throw off the Tatar yoke entirely and conquer the steppes for themselves. Likewise, §YLithuania§! has benefitted from the collapse of the Golden Horde. They have already stolen Ruthenia away from Tatar control and will likely continue to pose a threat to the nomads.\n\n§YUlugh Muhammad§! of §YKazan§! has twice proclaimed himself Khan of the Golden Horde, but his reigns were short-lived. With the support of local Bolghar nobles he seized the city of Kazan and established a new Khanate in the northern steppe. Kazan is an important trade hub, and the new Khanate can easily access nearby veins of metals both precious and utilitarian. As the wealthiest of the Tatar realms, Kazan is both a promising state and a target for greedy invaders.\n\nThe §YCrimean Khanate§! broke from the Great Horde in 1441 after the Crimean clans invited §YHaci Giray§!, a descendent of Ghenghis Khan, to rule them. Giray led the Crimean Tatars in a bloody struggle for independence, eventually emerging victorious and as Khan of a new horde. The Crimeans are avid slavers, and must contend with the §YGenoese§! colonies for control of local trade. They have also attracted the interests of the §YOttoman§! Sultan, who keeps a watchful eye over the Khanate’s affairs.\n\nThe §YNogai§! and §YUzbek§! Khanates, while successful in their bid for independence and controlling vast stretches of the steppe, lack the wealth or strategic importance of the other successor states. Opportunism must be their guiding philosophy if they wish to claim any part of Genghis Khan’s legacy, and by great fortune it seems that their §YTimurid§! neighbors are close to collapse and civil war. A worthy Khan might take the chance to seize the cities of §YSamarkand§! or §YBukhara§! while the Timurids are distracted."
 string_start_romania:0 "The Principalities of §YWallachia§! and §YMoldavia§! are nested between powers much greater than themselves. Thus far they have survived by playing the dangerous game of offering fealty to whichever nation they believe most likely to protect them against the others. A Voivode who wishes to thrive must carefully observe the balance of power.\n\nThe Voivodes had long been members of the Order of the Dragon, a noble and knightly order dedicated to defending Christendom from the encroaching §YOttoman Empire§!. It was no surprise when the Principalities answered the call for the §YCrusade of Varna§!. This grand military coalition aimed to drive the Turks from the Balkans and restore Christian rule. The Crusade, however, was a devastating failure, leaving kingdoms broken and the future of the region insecure.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Crusade a diplomatic incident led to the §YHungarian§! general §YHunyadi§! being imprisoned by §YVlad II§! of Wallachia. Though the situation was resolved without further conflict, relations have soured enough that Wallachia should not count on Hungarian aid for the time being.\n\nThe Voivode of Wallachia joined the Crusade in spite of his son §YVlad Dracula§! being an Ottoman captive; unsurprisingly he now believes that his son must have been slain by Turkish hands. Unbeknownst to the Voivode an embittered Vlad was spared by the Sultan and lives in exile, plotting his revenge against Turk and Wallachian alike.\n\nUncertainty grips Moldavia also; the former monarch §YIlias I§! has died in exile in §YPoland§!, leaving his son §YRoman§! as a potential claimant to the throne. Roman has secured nominal Polish support for his claim, pledging eternal Moldavian fealty should he become Voivode. It is only a matter of time before Roman attempts to seize the throne from his uncle §YStefan§!."
 string_start_irish_minors:0 "§YIreland§! in [GetYear] is divided among many disparate clans in the wake of the collapse of direct §YEnglish§! rule. English control is now limited to a small area around Dublin, known as the §YPale§!.\n\nImmediately beyond the Pale are the domains of the Peerage of Ireland, the Earls of §YDesmond§!, §YOrmond§!, §YUlster§!, and §YKildare§!. These lords once governed in the name of the English crown, but their fealty is now nominal at best. They reign independently and often in defiance of English influence. Over the centuries the transplanted Anglo-Norman nobility have become as Irish as the population they govern. §YOffaly§! and §YLeinster§! are surrounded by potential enemies but also by opportunities for an aggressive ruler.\n\nIn the north, the Earldoms of §YTyrone§!, §YTyrconnel§!, and Ulster sit precariously in the path of both English and §YScottish§! expansionism. The §YO'Neill§! clan of Tyrone may have to put aside their pride and consider an alliance with one of these powers if they ever wish to restore the legacy of their legendary ancestor, High King Niall of the Nine Hostages.\n\n§YThomond§!, §YSligo§!, §YClanricarde§!, and §YMunster§! in the west and south are relatively safe from the ambitions of regional powers, at least for the time being. These clans have long and storied histories, claiming descent from Irish heroes such as Brian Boru and Carthach the Elder. If they choose to seize it, they have the opportunity to expand throughout Ireland and become powers in their own right.\n\nAn Ireland united by a High King seems like a distant dream, but a dynasty that can overcome both their Irish rivals and the English invaders may yet claim that title once again."
 string_start_provence:0 "In [GetYear], §YProvence§! is ruled by ambitious René d'Anjou, who styles himself not only as Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, but also as the King of §YAragon§!, §YNaples§!, and §YJerusalem§!. The lords of Christendom pay little heed to these claims, yet Good King René is determined to reclaim his birthright.\n\nProvence controls a divided domain. Anjou is at the heart of the conflict between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, desired by both nations and likely to suffer from the coming wars. Provencal land in the Rhineland is split between the directly ruled Duchy of Bar and the subject Duchy of §YLorraine§!. Provence risks the ire of both the Holy Roman Emperor and the powerful Duchy of §YBurgundy§! if it chooses to meddle in affairs of the Rhineland Princes. The Duchy of Provence itself lies on the north coast of the Mediterranean, nested between France, §YSavoy§!, and the §YPapal§! city of Avignon. From here the ambitious René may launch an invasion of Aragon, though Italy may be a more tempting prize as the Empire's hold over the region wanes.\n\nProvence maintains good relations with its largest and most powerful neighbor, France. Provence must balance its own defensive needs and plans for expansion with French expectations of support should the Hundred Years war once again break out into open war.\n\nProvence is a nation with great ambitions, but even staving off annihilation may prove to be a challenge as surrounding nations eye its' lands greedily."
 string_start_brittany:0 "§YBrittany's§! situation in [GetYear] is much the same as in previous centuries. Caught between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, its Dukes have long had to struggle to maintain independence. France in particular has repeatedly made diplomatic and military attempts to annex Britanny into its domain.\n\nThe Second Treaty of Guérande, signed in 1381, formally declared Brittany neutral in the Hundred Years War. This conflict seems likely to once again lead to hostilities, as French demands for the surrender of §YMaine§! go unmet by England. How far the Dukes of Brittany will honour their promise of neutrality remains to be seen; there could be much to gain from involvement in the war, but also many dangers. Brittany is unlikely to be able to stand against either of the warring powers alone, and to that end may consider cooperation with the rising power of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nBrittany is a rich and fertile land with much potential for development. The capital of §YNantes§! has seen grand reconstruction efforts following a bloody succession war and currently stands as one of the major Atlantic port cities. The port of Brest meanwhile would make an ideal naval dockyard, being both a sheltered natural harbour and strategically located to intercept both French and English fleets.\n\nBrittany must choose its friends and enemies carefully if it's to survive in the modern era. If the tumultuous politics of Europe fail to offer opportunities, perhaps Brittany's destiny may lie beyond its shores."
 string_start_scotland:0 "By [GetYear] §YScotland§! has stood steadfast, fighting for and winning its independence from its would-be §YEnglish§! overlords. Scotland threw off the yoke of English rule after Robert the Bruce routed the English at Bannockburn in 1314, and has since consolidated its control over northern Britain.\n\nScotland's protection comes not only from its brave armies, but also from the Auld Alliance with §YFrance§!. This agreement obligates France to come to Scotland's aid should England once again try to subjugate them. War is an ever-present possibility as the marcher lords on both sides of the border threaten to escalate conflict through frequent skirmishes and a tendency to opportunistically switch sides for the sake of better raiding opportunities.\n\nIt has taken many years for Scotland to incorporate the §YHighlands§! into the kingdom. The Middle Ages saw the annexation of the formerly autonomous Kingdom of Moray, home of the usurper Macbeth, and the expansion of feudal institutions into the northern mainland. The integration of the Highlands would serve Scotland well as it became a staging ground for recruitment in the war against Edward Longshanks. The Hebrides were wrested away from the former Kingdom of the Isles under Alexander II, and not even the intervention of the King of §YNorway§! could halt the Scottish assault.\n\nKing James II has plans to further extend the Scottish domain in the surrounding isles. §YOrkney and the Shetlands§! are held by Norway, which is itself currently subject to §YDenmark§!. Taking on the full might of Scandinavia would be challenging, but perhaps a diplomatic solution will present itself. England and Scotland have squabbled over the §YIsle of Mann§! for centuries. Currently the English have the upper hand, but an opportunistic ruler might exploit their preoccupation with fighting France to seize it for themselves.\n\nThe House of §YStuart§! has ruled Scotland for less than a century, but they have ruled well. If Scotland is able to turn the tide against England, the Stuarts could one day rule all of the British Isles."
 string_start_great_ming:2 "The Great §YMing§! Empire owes its origins to the collapse of the §YYuan§! dynasty from §YMongolia§! and the period of rebellion and strife that struck China in the mid-14th century. From this age of chaos, the Ming emerged as the greatest power in China, eliminating their Han rivals and pushing the descendants of §YKublai Khan§! back to the Great Wall. After eighty years of governance, the Ming have firmly established themselves as the preeminent power in East Asia.\n\nEven though Ming continues to prosper, its international presence has flagged since the end of Zheng He's voyages, and new realms have posed fresh challenges to the empire. In the divided north, nomads have begun to coalesce under the leadership of the §YOirat§! warlord §YEsen§!, who aspires to become the new Great Khan of all the Mongols. Ming diplomacy at least prevented a similar movement from happening among the §YJurchen§! tribes to the northeast, where Imperial policy has encouraged infighting among the nomads. While the fractious and distracted Jurchens are unlikely to pose a threat any time soon, Esen's Oirats may prove to be a very formidable foe indeed.\n\nMing's relations in the south are somewhat better. §YDai Viet§! freed itself from Ming domination only two decades prior, and still remains wary of its Chinese neighbor to the north. Other powers in the region have a more positive opinion of Ming, but mountains and jungles mean that Ming receives little more than token tributes from the southern kingdoms.\n\nMing's relations are strongest with the §YJoseon§! dynasty of §YKorea§!. Both Ming and the Joseon dynasty emerged from the ashes of the Great Yuan, and thanks to their common adherence to Confucian philosophy both have maintained strong bonds ever since.\n\nNot all of Ming's troubles are external; the §YMandate of Heaven§! is a fickle one, and if the Emperor's authority wavers too much then there are those who may choose to shun the Ming altogether. China would have to fall far indeed to reach such dire straits; in the 15th century, the Great Ming Empire is by far the strongest realm in Asia, and quite possibly on Earth!"

Though §YMongolia§! still claims the Yuan Emperorship, the §YMandate of Heaven§! has shifted to the §YMing§!, who seized power in the midst of a mass uprising against Mongol rule.\n\nToday the Mongol Khan cannot even claim to rule the steppe, or even to rule independently. Most of Mongolia has fallen under the sway of a new Mongol power: the §YOirat Confederation§! led by §YEsen Taishi§!. Esen has great ambitions; refusing to pay tribute to the Ming, he is willing to fight their vast armies in a bid for dominance. If Esen were not such a brilliant military commander the Western Mongols would be unlikely to accept such brash posturing.\n\n§YKhan Unebolad§! of the §YKorchin§! Mongols has carved out a respectable domain in Eastern Mongolia. He too has grand ambitions to reunite the Mongols, though his armies and abilities are more of a match for the divided Jurchens to the east than the consolidated forces of the Oirats.\n\nThe §YChagatai Khanate§! is the most stable of the Mongol successor states, though this does not hold it to a high standard. The §YChagatayids§! retain control over the land north of the §YTian Shan§! mountains, as well as over the §YYarkand Emirate§! of the Tarim Basin.\n\nMany among the Mongols have adopted the §YVajrayana§! faith, the §YTibetan§! sect of Buddhism. For the last several centuries this faith has coexisted peacefully with traditional Mongol belief in §YTengri§!, and the faith was even favored for a time under the Yuan.

 string_start_philippines:0 "In [GetYear] the Philippine islands are home to a number of small seafaring city states. The islands have always been distant enough to preserve their autonomy even in the face of strong hegemons like the former Srivijaya empire or the muslim Sultanates of §YBrunei§! and §YMalacca§!.\n\nInstead the archipelago has developed into a microcosm of indianized, sinophile and islamicized kingdoms, each with their own character and background.\n\nIn the north, on the island of Luzon, the city states of §YPangasinan§! and §YTondo§! thrive on the trade with the §YEmpire of China§!. Their status as tributaries allows them to gather Chinese goods for resale to the other islands. To this end the small Islamic city state of §YMaynila§!, has entered into close cooperation with Tondo. The latter acts as a port towards the Chinese while the former is the central point for the spreading of Chinese goods to the other islands.\n\nFurther south, in the Visayan archipelago, a number of Hindu settlements are competing to control the trade routes. The island kingdom of §YCebu§! is perhaps the oldest state in the region. The Cebu rulers claim the legacy of a prince of the Indian §YChola§! Empire. Many of the other states have entered into the federation of §YMadyas§!, a loose organization where each member takes turns to assume leadership over the others.\n\nWhile the old Hindu Rajahnate of §YButuan§! has traditionally held the upper hand in the far south it has recently had increasing competition from the Muslim oriented states of §YMaguindanao§! and §YSulu§!. Sulu has all but entered the sphere of the Muslim Sultanate of Brunei while Maguindanao has seen the royal family increasingly embracing islamic traditions over their traditional animist religion.\n\nSome would say that the divided nature of this rich archipelago at the turn of [GetYear] makes it vulnerable.

Khanate, and the §YRussian§! Principalities, lead by §YMuscovy§! in the north west. This cooperation has allowed the two countries to thrive despite their many enemies, but integrating the nobility of two such divergent states has not been an easy matter. Among both the Polish and the Lithuanian nobility there are some, the Magnates, who control very large estates and command great political influence. These families are in some ways the financial and political backbone of their states, but they are also a power factor that even kings might think twice before rejecting.\n\nWhile large parts of their lands are sparsely populated there is little doubt that Poland and Lithuania could be among the most powerful states in Europe if they go forward with their integration. Their enemies are however quite formidable. In the far south the §YOttoman§! Empire seems to be at the gates of Hungary, ready to expand up the flow of the Danube. To the north the highly militarized Teutonic Order consider the two states its main enemy. An uneasy agreement has been reached with the Knights following the Lithuanian Civil War, by which all parties agreed to recognize both the existing borders and the Polish-Lithuanian king. Perhaps most dangerous of them all however, is the Grand Duchy of Muscovy in the far north east. The Muscovites are rapidly creating a strong and expansive state to challenge the Lithuanian overlordship over the Ruthenian and Russian peoples that inhabit most of the Grand Duchy..."

Before the French can even begin thinking about expanding their Empire, they must first ensure the loyalty of their subjects and integrate them into a centralized state, and remove the cursed English and Burgundian pretender Kingdoms from their border.

Decades of religious civil wars have left the country ravaged with some parts still dominated by powerful Hussite nobles, heretics to the Catholic faith.\nOnly in Austria, the homeland of the Habsburg dynasty, has Ladislaus been accepted, though his uncle §YFrederick§! now rules as his regent.\n\nWith the catastrophe of Varna the Hungarian throne is again vacant, and Habsburg supporters remain hopeful that it can be reclaimed for Ladislaus. The powerful groups that deposed the boy king once do not seem disposed to accept him a second time. They may well let their dynamic Hungarian regent Janos Hunyadi lead them instead.\n\nThe dream of a Habsburg Emperor was not lost with Albert. Upon his death, Frederick, the Austrian regent, was elected to lead the Holy Roman Empire. As the first of his family to sit on the Imperial throne Frederick will leave a legacy for future Habsburgs. Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe. The responsibilities of Imperial rule are great obstacles in themselves.

The Castilian Nobles and the local Cortes of the various constituent kingdoms still hold a large degree of power and many Trastámara kings have found themselves at the mercy of the estates of their kingdoms.

Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy already rival many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time.

Even as an adult however Henry seems unwilling to rule, some would say he is even worryingly detached from reality. Intriguing nobles of the realm have instead come to dominate Henry's regime, assuming power and positioning themselves for a future succession. Such feuds might well cripple the internal stability of the Kingdom, especially if hostilities in France commence again.\n\nWith the English busy with continental and internal affairs the dominion over §YIreland§! has shrunken to a thin strip along the sea known as 'The Pale', with Gaelic lords as well as Hiberno-Normans acting entirely independent of the English Crown.

The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan's authority.\n\nAll this is about to change. Having defeated the Crusader armies, the old sultan Murad II is now on his way back to his estates in Manisa, leaving the government in the hands of the young §YMehmed II§!.

Even the Christian empire of §YEthiopia§! must be attentive to the word of the Mamluk Sultan, as the Coptic pope, the ordainer of all Ethiopian bishops, is under Mamluk care.\n\nThe Mamluk amirs reproduce their ranks by purchasing new mamluks, foreign slaves mostly of Circassian origin. These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or 'foster-father'. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system, it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\nThe future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive §YTimurid§!

Both seem destined to come into conflict with the Mamluks in the near future.\n\nThe wealth of the sultanate is fed by the trade that flows through its Egyptian lands, bridging the distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This places great demands on the Mamluk fleets to battle Christian pirates in the north as well as to protect the huge vulnerable vessels that follow the Hejaz coastline with coffee, cloth and spices through the Red Sea.\n\nAs [GetYear] draws to an end the Mamluk Sultanate is still the largest, richest and strongest state in the Middle East, it has many enemies but fears few of them."

Under the §YTughlaq§! dynasty it grew into the largest Indian empire the world had seen since the Guptas. The empire spanned from §YSindh§! to §YBengal§!, from §YKashmir§! to the §YCoromandel Coast§!.\n\nThe Tughlaq empire collapsed as quickly as it rose to power. Though it is a Muslim state ruling over many millions of Hindus, its downfall was orchestrated by ambitious Muslim generals rather than popular Hindu resistance. In 1347 the entirety of southern §YIndia§! was lost in the revolt of general Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, who declared himself ruler of the new Sultanate of §YBahmanis§!.\n\nMore recently, the Sultanate suffered a catastrophic blow when the §YSharqi§! governors of §YJaunpur§! broke away in 1394, taking with them a vast stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and reducing the Sultanate's influence to an area barely beyond the city walls. Mahmud Shah, Sultan of Jaunpur, eyes his neighbors hungrily; he has designs not only on the throne of Delhi, but also on the nearby Bengal Sultanate and the §YGajapati§! Kingdom of §YOrissa§!. The Sultan's ambitions threaten to engulf all of northern India.\n\nThe final nail in the Tughlaq's coffin came with the brutal §YTimurid§! invasion in 1398. The fearsome warlord had no intention of beginning a conquest of India, instead setting his armies to loot and burn and massacre all that they laid eyes upon. In the midst of the chaos, the Tughlaq dynasty was finally overthrown by the §YSayyid§! governors of Delhi. The upstart Sayyids have thus far entirely failed to put an end to the catastrophe facing the Sultanate. Only the Rajputs of §YJangladesh§! remain truly loyal to the Sultan in this period of ruin.\n\nJust as the Sayyids rose from governors to Sultans, another powerful governor has risen in §YSirhind§!. Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan noble, is an extremely adept governor and military leader. His control of the §YPunjab§! gives him a dangerous degree of power, which he is likely to leverage in a bid to seize control of Delhi itself. The Sayyid Sultan hides in his palace as Lodi gathers his strength in preparation for a rebellion.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate is in the midst of collapse.

Determined to drive back the invaders, the rising §YSangama§! dynasty rallied an army and united much of southern India against their common enemy.\n\nThough the Delhi Sultanate was ousted from the south a century ago, Vijayanagar has not seen the end of its struggle against Islamic conquerors. In 1347 the §YBahmanis§! Sultanate won its independence from Delhi and has since become a power in its own right. The rivalry and warfare between Bahmanis and Vijayanagar has thus far been inconclusive; territory has changed hands, tribute has been demanded and refused, yet each kingdom remains steadfast in their determination to thwart the other.\n\nBesides its northern rival, Vijayanagar finds itself surrounded by far weaker nations. The Sangamas have allied with the §YReddy§! Kingdom of §YAndhra§!, agreeing to protect them from incursions from Bahmanis and §YOrissa§!. Though nominally Vijayanagari subjects, the small §YMalabari§! kingdoms as well as the Raja of §YMysore§! are largely left to their own devices. The time may come when the Raja requires more of them.

Jaunpur controls a vast stretch of the Doab, the great riverine lands of the Ganges. Bengal and Jaunpur came to blows as recently as 1420. Though the conflict came to an abrupt end due to the intervention of Timurid and Ming envoys, many sore issues remain between both nations and further wars may be inevitable.\n\nRelations with the Buddhist Sultans of §YArakan§! have fluctuated wildly; in one year they are the Bengal’s loyal subjects, in another they are ambivalent allies, and in yet another they are a pirate menace.

 string_start_bahmanis:0 "The sack of §YDelhi§! in 1398 was a monumental event for the subcontinent, but in §YBidar§! it did not have the impact it did elsewhere. The §YBahmani§! Sultans declared their independence from the north 50 years prior and had already built a new state in the dry Deccani upland. Rich in economic assets, among others the fabled diamond mines of Golconda, the Sultans are now wealthier than most kings. Their court, and its fabled Turquoise throne, is famous beyond the subcontinent. Fame that greatly helps to attract the greedy and gifted from the wider Muslim world.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate is also a troubled state. Cutting ties with the north has meant that it is without direct access to the west. At the same time the kingdom has a much smaller Muslim minority than most northern Sultanates and in its isolation even the most persianate of nobles have begun to adopt local culture and language. Newcomers and indigenized nobles often end up in conflict with each other and the new capital of Bidar has been built partly to avoid the intrigues of the old one in Gulbarga.\n\nNot far from the kingdom's southern border lies the City of Victory, §YVijayanagar§!. The city is the seat of the Sangama Rajas, and with its 400 000 inhabitants it is a very different place from the orderly fort city of Bidar. This is the capital of an Empire that stretches across Southern India and that has recently conquered almost the entire Tamil country in the far south. Vijayanagar is a formidable rival to Bahmani power, and has continued to advance on the contested zone between the two kingdoms. The seizure of the western Bahmani ports by agents of the Vijayanagara Empire is a strike right at the heart of the Sultanate's lifeline of immigration and imports.\n\nIn the east Kapilendra, founder of the Gajapati dynasty of §YOrissa§!, has orchestrated the sudden rise of his kingdom as a military power. Striking at §YJaunpur§!, §YBengal§!, Vijayanagar and Bahmani interests at the same time the new king has in short time made a name for himself as a conqueror.

Kapilendra Gajapati, 'Lord of the Elephants', has turned his regional kingdom into a major power. Drawing upon the loyalty of the Garjat jungle kingdoms and the devotees of Jagannath, he has assembled a great army that performs especially well in the jungles and hills of Eastern India. In short succession Kapilendra has won a number of great victories, each seemingly more unlikely than the next. Having defeated Jaunpur, Bengal, the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar in various regional conflicts, he is now greedily eyeing Telingana and the Andhran coastline. With 18 legitimate sons, Kapilendra must act prudently to avoid all his great conquests being lost upon his death.\n\nIn the central Deccani upland the §YBahmani§! Sultanate has been free of Delhi's overlordship for almost 100 years. The Sultans are rich beyond the wildest dreams of the people in their old homelands in Iran, Transoxiana and Arabia, yet they are also the masters of a state far from the entrenched Muslim aristocrats of northern India. Cut off from the north, the state has become dependent on immigration from the Muslim west as well as the acquisition of foreign war horses from overseas. The recent loss of the western coastline is, therefore, a catastrophe for the Sultanate, and steps have been taken to expand to the eastern coast instead, interfering in the internal politics of the Velamas of §YTelingana§! as well as the Reddys of §YAndhra§!.\n\nJust a short distance from the Bahmani capital in §YBidar§! lies §YVijayanagar§!, the 'City of Victory' and the capital of their main adversary. From their base near the Tungabhadra river, the Sangama Rajas have built a military base in the dry Deccani upland that they then used to conquer the entire Tamil country to the south. The Tamil lands are incredibly rich, and could likely fund the growing Viyanagara empire for decades, yet integration has not been easy. The rich Tamil trade guilds retain a lot of power and they are also an excellent base for usurpers.\n\nThe south is also home to a number of smaller states, anxiously watching the titanic struggle between Vijayanagar, the Bahmanis and the surging Orissa Kingdom.

Destined to be successful beyond his wildest dreams, he is about to found an Empire to rule one fourth of the world's population.\n\nFor the most part however, the world of [GetYear] remains one of mostly isolated regions.

To the south, the §YPapal State§! yearns to recover territories the Venetians seized from it as recently as 1440 and loathes the autonomy of Venice's clergymen. The Republic must remain vigilant and use all the diplomatic tools at its disposal to prevent its rivals from working together, lest Venice's fate lay in the balance.\n\nVenice's internal security is also carefully watched by the authorities. Although Venice is a §Yrepublic§!, its system of government is a very peculiar one, designed to both shut out the mob and to prevent any one patrician family from seizing control of government, as has happened in some mainland communes.

If commerce is to prosper once more, the Danes must learn the error of their trade policies. Further east, the city of Visby on the island of §YGotland§! was once a formidable and rich Hanseatic town, but a Danish attack on Visby in 1361 and various following depredations by Danes and pirates ruined the city's wealth and autonomy. The recovery of Visby and conquest of Gotland would be a key moment in the revitalization of the Hanseatic League.\n\nThe Hanseatic Cities cannot ignore German affairs, either. The free cities of the League owe their allegiance to the §YHoly Roman Emperor§! and enjoy “Imperial Immediacy”, able to deal directly with the Imperial court rather than working through various regional organs.

 string_start_title_byzantium:1 "The True Heirs to the §YRoman Empire§!"
 string_start_byzantium:2 "With the §YRoman Empire§! now a distant memory, countless Empires have dared to take the mantle as the true successors to Rome, but the §YByzantines§! remain adamant that they hold the only legitimate claim to that ancient Empire. In 1171, the rivalry between §YByzantium§! and §YVenice§! reached a boiling point as the nations’ hostilities towards each other erupted into violent conflict. \n\nIn April 1204, guided by the vengeful spirit of the Venetians, the members of the Fourth Crusade defied the command of Pope §YInnocent III§! and turned their violence towards the §YByzantine Empire§! which had promised them safe passage. The Crusaders ravaged the city of Constantinople two times over, reducing the once glorious city to little more than ash and rubble, and reducing the Empire to little more still. Although the House of §YPalaiologos§! was able to restore much of what was lost, countless successor states such as the Theme of §YEpirus§! and §YNaxos§! have managed to evade reintegration with the Empire. The chaos created by the fall of the §YByzantine§! Empire has given rise to the §YOttoman§! Turks who now situate themselves on the §YByzantine§! border with the ambition to claim §YConstantinople§!, the City of World’s Desire, for themselves.\n\nIn 1444, Byzantium finds itself surrounded by heretics and heathens on all sides; with many of their old subjects now bending the knee to the Venetian Doge who sparked the end of their empire, and many others now firmly under the control of the §YOttomans§!. Powers in both the West and East believe that the age of §YByzantium§! is long since over, but §YBasilius Ioannes VIII Palaiologos§! remains confident that the Purple Phoenix shall rise once again and reclaim not just §YByzantium§!, but the §YRoman Empire§! itself!"
 string_start_title_naples:1 "The Neapolitan Struggle"
 string_start_naples:3 "After the §YSicilian§! Rebellion of 1282, the §YNeapolitan§! King §YCharles§! of §YAnjou§! lost control of the island to §YPeter III§! of §YAragon§!. With only the territories in mainland Italy to his name, the Kingdom of §YSicily§! Became forfeit and its King adopted the title: the Kingdom of §YNaples§!. \n\n When Queen §YJoan I§! died childless, the Neapolitan Kingdom fell into a constant state of civil war; with cousins of all kinds of claims and titles to their name fighting for control of the Kingdom. §YAlfonso V§! of Aragon settled this dispute with blood, driving out all other pretenders and uniting the Crown of §YAragon§! with the Kingdom of §YNaples§!. \n\nIn 1444, the Kingdom of Naples is a captive in a very delicate situation. They remain under union with the Crown of Aragon, but the Aragonese claim to the throne is weak and the question of who truly belongs on the throne is something of an ongoing dispute. With blood ties to the Kingdom of §YFrance§!, the Neapolitan Succession Crisis has become a matter of great tension between Aragon and France. \n\nTo the north, the §YPapal State§! controls §YRome§! and much of Central Italy. Meanwhile, the Italian Peninsula is shattered into small realms such as §YFlorence§! and city-states like §YLucca§! and §YBologna§!. To the south, §YTunis§! remains a large threat to the economic stability of the Kingdom, as the marauding pirates often raid the coastline of Naples and disrupt Italian maritime trade. However, the question still remains: how will Naples break free from the iron grasp of Aragonese rule and reunite the §YTwo Sicilies§!?"
 string_start_title_genoa:1 "The Maritime Merchants of §YGenoa§!"
 string_start_genoa:1 "The Republic of §YGenoa§! first gained its independence from the Kingdom of §YItaly§! in 1005. As the hostilities between Venetians and the Greeks erupted into the sack of §YConstantinople§!, Genoa capitalized on the situation in a race against its rival §YVenice§! and expanded deep into the Black Sea and §YCrimea§!. \n\nHowever the prosperity did not last; when the Black Death cast its shadow over Europe and Genoa was forced to pay the reaper’s due in blood and suffering. In an effort to recover from the tragedy of the Black Death, Genoa emulated the Venetian model of republican government where the Doge would hold the highest title in the government and claim sovereignty over the entire Republic. \n\nMeanwhile, Genoa would find itself in endless conflict with the Venetians, contesting hold over the Greek archipelago and the Black Sea. As conflicts with Venice began to subside, Genoa launched a crusade alongside §YFrance§! against the Barbary corsairs in §YTunis§!. While the siege of §YMahdia§! was not successful, both sides negotiated a peace treaty that would drastically reduced the piracy issue from the North Africans. \n\nIn 1444, Genoa has already lost several conflicts with France and §YMilan§!, and the island of §YSardinia§! has long since been lost to the Crown of §YAragon§!. Genoa finds itself in a precarious position; to the east, Venice is still a competitor and the leader of the rival trade league, contesting Genoese influence in Anatolia. The Ottomans have made it clear they wish to consolidate Anatolia and the Black Sea, seizing any opportunities they have to wrestle the Genoese out of the region. Meanwhile, other Italian republics and city-states continue to struggle with the dominance in Italy. Milan to the east and France and Aragon to the west pose the greatest threat to the survival of Genoa, and it will take a delicate hand on the pen and the sword to navigate this complex web of alliances and claims and guide Genoa into a prosperous future."
 string_start_tag_arabia:0 "§YArabia§! is the origin of the Muslim faith. Despite being fractured between §YSunni§!, §YShia§! and §YIbadi§!, it is undeniable that Arabia is the place chosen by Allah.\n\nDespite rapid and effective expansion of Islam from its humble origins, Arabia itself remains divided into multiple tribes. The straits of §YHormuz§! on the east coast concentrate all trade flowing to and from the rich lands of Persia and Mesopotamia, and India. The west side of the peninsula is where the holy cities of §YMecca§! and §YMedina§! lay, and where the influence of the nearby §YMamluks§! is felt more strongly. The southern tip of §YYemen§! is entangled in a struggle between the §YSunni§! and §YShia§! faiths, while the central deserts are dominated by different §YBedouin§! tribes.\n\nBeing surrounded by powerful powers such as those of the §YMamluks§!, §YOttomans§! and §YTimurids§!, any of those could decide to take Arabia for themselves and thus control the holly cities of §YMecca§! and §YMedina§!. Only a unified Arabia will be able to stand its own among the big empires of the world, and reclaim the title of Caliph, leader and prophet of all Islam."
 string_start_ajam:0 "Emerging from the remnants of the §YTimurid Empire§!, and having been able to unshackle themselves from the control of the main heirs of Timur, the nation of Ajam finds itself in a privileged position in the central parts of §YPersia§!. Many empires have been formed in these lands, and many others have used the same lands as expansion routes for their own empires. From the ancient conquerors of Cyrus, Xerxes and Alexander; to the more recent ones of Genghis Khan and Timur, Ajam's land is certainly no stranger to powerful empires.\n\nAs such, all powerful nations around will stare at these lands with greed. The neighboring §YMamluks§!, §YOttomans§! or §YTimurids§! could easily turn into a threat to Ajam's survival if they are not dealt with. As one of the heirs of Timur themselves, Ajam has as much right as the others to establish a powerful and true §YPersian Empire§!."
 string_start_ardabil:0 "Many empires have been formed in these lands, and many others have used the same lands as expansion routes for their own empires. From the ancient conquerors of Cyrus, Xerxes and Alexander; to the more recent ones of Genghis Khan and Timur, Ardabil's land is certainly no stranger to powerful empires. But besides the struggles amongst empires, another one looms on the horizon.\n\nDespite all following Allah, Ardabil find themselves relatively isolated in their §YShia§! faith, as most of their neighbors are followers instead of the §YSunni§! faith. The §YSafavid Order§! has not only provided a religious guidance to Ardabil among Shia and Sufi beliefs, but has also given name to the Safavid Dynasty itself. This, combinend with its militant groups the §YQizilbash§!, ensures the strength of both heart and arm of Arbadil.\n\nPowerful neighbors threaten their borders, but through the proper guidance the nation of Ardabil is sure to be able to become a force to reckon with, and the next §YPersian Empire§!"
