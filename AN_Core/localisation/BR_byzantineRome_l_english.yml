 #New Byzantine Resurgence ideas:
 reinstitute_the_pronoia:0 "Reinstitution of the Pronoia"
 reinstitute_the_pronoia_desc:0 "The Pronoia was a system of small taxable land grants that allowed for the recruitment of self-supporting armies used by the Palaiologos dynasty. Inherited from the Komnenos, it only became hereditary under the Palaiologos. As the Empire continued to lose more land to the Ottomans, the Pronoiar would similarly diminish. Re-establishing it will once again allow for self-supporting units from which we can draw our Imperial Army."
 byzantine_renaissance:0 "Byzantine Renaissance"
 byzantine_renaissance_desc:0 "Not only have the past centuries harbored a vast number of freethinkers in our lands - with Constantinople and therefore our Empire placed at the border between the West and the East, we have historically been able to adapt the best of both sides, resulting in peak innovation that in the current age will only lead to good."
 basilics_law:0 "Basilics"
 basilics_law_desc:0 "The code of laws that is said to have influenced almost every single country's laws to date is Justinian's Code. Based on this code, Leo the Wise and his brothers in the 10th century created the Basilics, correcting its contradictions and translated it into Greek, setting a new standard for what is Roman Law, at least in the Empire."
 byz_formalize_succession_laws:0 "Formalization of Succession Laws"
 byz_formalize_succession_laws_desc:0 "The succession of the Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans has ever since the founding of Rome been based off the ideals of the Republic - Every successor is elected co-emperor and backed by the Senate, at least in name. This has in more than one occasion resulted in numerous pretenders claiming the throne for themselves. Considering the Palaiologoi have managed to held the throne ever since the reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, it would only be fitting that we are the ones who establish clear succession laws, as we rise once more from the ashes."
 byzantine_resurgence:0 "The Purple Phoenix"
 byzantine_resurgence_desc:0 "We have through our hardships and endeavors managed to rise from the ashes. Clad in the most royal purple, we are determined to reclaim our legacy as the ancestors of Western Civilization. Our Imperial banner shall wave in the wind as we strike down our foes with righteous might. Let it be known that this is the dawn of a new age. An age of restoration. An age of triumph and resurgence. An age that will forever go down in history as the rebirth of the Purple Phoenix."

Referring to themselves as miaphysites, believing that Christ has one nature that is both human and divine, they gradually separated from the then Chalcedonian belief to form their own branch of Christendom.

 #Renovatio Imperii incorporated units for Eastern tech, only slightly altered certain text to remove some present tense, as well as slightly altering the description of Themata Infantry as the Theme System is re-established differently in this mod.
 #Three units were skipped: Preobrazhensky Infantry, Eastern Jaegers and Russian Reformed Mass Infantry. The reason being that the mod makes it so that Eastern units are on par with Western, giving the Russian Mass Infantry at tech 28 instead of 30, which I don't necessarily agree with.
 #The Jaeger is skipped because all Eastern units adapted from Western usually appear a tier later than they do in Western. Since Jaegers are the final tier, I argue there is no way they can appear at the same time, unless you add another unit tier after tech 30, which I'm not ready to do. If I would, then the Reformed Mass Infantry could exist as well.
 #The Preobrazhensky is skipped because this is already represented in the Petrine infantry, which is both the Preobrazhensky and the Semyonovsky, meaning it should've been a tier earlier.
 #Besides, the mod also introduces the reformed Petrine to work beside the Green Coat as a more defensive alternative. Giving 3 different Russian infantry is a bit too much in my opinion. Since I also moved Reformed Varangians to this spot, I think that's fair.

 eastern_raiders:0 "Eastern Raiders"
 eastern_raidersDESCR:0 "These were powerful offensive infantry designed to blitz the enemy line before they fully organize."
 varangian_infantry:0 "Varangian Infantry"
 varangian_infantryDESCR:0 "The Varangian Guard was an elite unit of the Byzantine Empire during the era of the Makedon dynasty through the early Palaiologan Dynasty. Recruited from the Scandinavians, Russians, and later Englishmen, the Varangians were feared for their tremendous fighting strength. Due to their status as foreigners in the Empire, they were largely kept out of the many political intrigues preventing them from being used against the Emperor. The Varangian Guard was disbanded during the 14th century due to the decline of the Empire, but was reconstituted by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos in the mid 15th century. The reformed Varangian Guard not only consisted of mercenaries from the Russian region, but also were recruited from the Balkans and Anatolia as well. Serving in the Varangian Guard not only paid well for these mercenaries, but was also a chance to attain Byzantine citizenship as well, which bound the new Varangians to the Empire more tightly then other mercenary companies were to other states in the renaissance era."
 balanced_eastern_musketeers:0 "Balanced Eastern Musketeers"
 balanced_eastern_musketeersDESCR:0 "With gunpowder becoming the central focus of warfare in the early modern era, new tactics and formations were created to take advantage of these new weapons. In Byzantium, a new school of thought arose that the musketeers should be adaptable for any situation, whether it was to press the attack or entrench themselves."

 reformed_eastern_tercioDESCR:0 "Much like how the tercio formation in Western Europe kept evolving with the advancements in warfare, the tercio formations in Eastern European countries kept evolving as well."
 themata_infantry:0 "Themata Infantry"
 themata_infantryDESCR:0 "With the Byzantine Empire surviving the Ottoman onslaught and reconquering their lands, Emperor Demetrios III restored the imperial provincial administration known as the Theme System. Much like how the Theme System operated in previous eras, soldiers in the Imperial Army were given parcels of land in reward for serving in the military. These were not permanent land grants, as the lands officially belonged to the Emperor. As long as the family kept working the land, they and their kin were expected to serve in the Imperial Army. This served to provide manpower to the Imperial Army without resorting to conscription, a process that was very unpopular with the citizens of the Empire. What is noticeably different about the troops that were raised under the restored system is that rather than being local defensive militias, the infantry were professional troops that were heavily trained and disciplined. Each theme was reorganized as a self-contained army, and soon begin to reflect the same characteristics as the earlier Legionary system had. Only Byzantine citizens were allowed to join a theme, and each theme had a single area in the Empire that they were associated with. This created a bond between the theme, and the locality that it was recruited from, as well as promoting traditions in the military. Some of the most famous themes to serve the Empire in the early modern era was Thema Thrakes, who finally put an end to the Ottoman Sultanate in 1573, Thema Optimaton who was instrumental in the reconquests of Antioch and Jerusalem as well as leading the siege of Mecca, and Thema Makedonikon, who along with the Varangian Guard and the Palatines were responsible for the rout of the Papal Coalition in 1661."
 palatine_cavalry:0 "Palatine Cavalry"
 palatine_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Palatines were an elite cavalry unit in the Byzantine Imperial Army. Riding far ahead of the Imperial Army, the Palatines would engage in raids and irregular warfare designed to disrupt the enemies organizational capabilities and infrastructure before the main army advanced into the region. The Palatines were one of the earliest examples of a special operations unit in the early modern early. Known for operating far behind enemy lines, the Palatines had an uncanny knack for forming a shock force and attacking the enemy army from behind when they could least expect it. The greatest example was the routing of the Papal Coalition in 1661, in which a coalition of the Spaniards, French, Austrians, and the various Italian city-states were fighting the Empire on the outskirts of Rome. The Palatines, back from raiding in Ancona, accidently happened upon the main supply post for the coalition in Tusculum. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Palatines burned the outpost, which set confusion of the coalition. The timely arrival of reinforcements in the form of the Varangian Guard and the Greek themes broke the back of resistance, and the coalition was defeated."
 hajduk_infantry:0 "Hajduk Infantry"
 hajduk_infantryDESCR:0 "Footsoldiers inspired by the Balkan and Carpathian militaries that formed the backbone of the Polish infantry from the 1570s until about the 1630s. Unusually for this period, Polish-Lithuanian hajduks wore uniforms, typically of grey-blue woolen cloth, with red collar and cuffs. Their principal weapon was an arquebus. For close combat they also carried a heavy variety of sabres."
 scholarian_infantry:0 "Scholarian Infantry"
 scholarian_infantryDESCR:0 "The Scholarians were the infantry of the Byzantine Empire that was established in the military reforms by Constantine XII Palaiologos in the mid 17th century. The themata infantry had previously began adopting practices from the Legions, including creating a professional fighting force backed by highly disciplined troops. The military reforms not only increased support of the professionalization of the Imperial Army, the Emperor also enacted into Law the Military Education Act. Citizens joining the military were not only expected to be able to read and write, they were also schooled in tactics, drills, techniques, and formations as well. This typically took a total of three years to complete. Once a soldier graduated from the military school, he would become a full-fledged member of the Imperial Army. The heavy focus of education not only on the officers, but also on the rank and file caused other nations to began referring to these soldiers as Scholarians. This emphasis on quality meant that the Imperial Army was not able to maintain a massive army, as many potential recruits would not be able to pass the schooling. However, the quality resulting from the graduates far outstripped the drawbacks from not having a large pool of recruitments. It was not uncommon to see a single theme of Scholarians beat back a force three times their own size, as was demonstrated in the Papal Wars in the 1660's. The uniforms of the Scholarian took on an heavy emphasis on Eastern fashions, wearing red fez caps, red jackets, yellow shirts, and red Bracca, a type of light breeches. Rather than carry western style arms, the Scholarians sported arms from the Middle East, preferring their simplicity compared to more western arms."

 reformed_palatine_cavalryDESCR:0 "The reformation of the Palatine cavalry unit was pretty necessary given the Palatine's popularity and the continued advancements within the military. Not only was the Palatine used in irregular warfare, they were also used in shock attacks against enemy formations much more frequently. Therefore, they had to adapt to becoming a heavy cavalry force."
 reformed_varangian_infantry:0 "Reformed Varangian Infantry"
 reformed_varangian_infantryDESCR:0 "The evolution of the Byzantine Imperial Army, especially with the establishment of the Theme System and the creation of the Scholarians meant that the Varangian Guard was slowly losing their place as the shock troops of the Empire. In addition, the professionalization of militaries in Europe led to a decline in military companies, as less and less nations were willing to hire mercenaries when they had their own, much more loyal forces to count on. This lead to military reforms which addressed the issue of the declining utility of the Varangians."

These Palatines, fanatical in their loyalty to the Emperor, and regarded as suicidal by their enemies and even fellow soldiers in the Imperial Army, were given long lances and were used as the shock force designed to disrupt and destroy enemy formations. The Palatine Lancers could be regarded as one of the last examples of heavy cavalry in the Empire."
 #eastern_jaeger_infantry:0 " Eastern Jaeger Infantry"
 #eastern_jaeger_infantryDESCR:0 "As the Austrian Empire used jaegar infantry to great effect in their infantries, so too did nations in Eastern Europe adopt these light infantry.

 reformed_scholarian_infantryDESCR:0 "The Scholarians continued to learn and adopt new techniques and formations from the enemies they fought, and employed them against said enemies.
