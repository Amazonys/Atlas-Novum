 feo_black_sea_fleet_title:0 "Black Sea Fleet"
 feo_black_sea_fleet_desc:0 "The Black Sea has been a hotspot of mercantile competition ever since the arrival of the Italians in the Crimean shores. Our Principality has seen a slow decline in maritime actions, being pushed around by the Ottomans, Italians, Hordes, as well as fellow Greeks. Creating a new fleet to combat these problems will be quite beneficial."

 feo_black_sea_domination_title:0 "Black Sea Domination"
 feo_black_sea_domination_desc:0 "Trade has always been the main source of revenue for the Greeks. Trade, which Gothia has seen a decline of since the grip of the Komnenos dynasty loosened, and the Italian Yoke emerged. Reclaiming our position in the Black Sea will put a stop to this decline."

 feo_komnenos_relations_title:0 "Ties With the Komnenos"
 feo_komnenos_relations_desc:0 "The Komnenos in Trebizond were our old allies decades ago. They were the rulers of Gothia, yet our merchant family was able to slowly emerge as a player in the Black Sea politics. Now that their realm is in decline, it is perhaps time the roles are reversed."

 feo_constantinople_title:0 "A Merchant's Family Home"
 feo_constantinople_desc:0 "Constantinople, the city where many Emperors ruled before us. The old center of culture, wealth, and prestige for any Greek, and the city where many families like ours emerged from. It is time we return once more, and hold a triumph in the streets to let them know that we have vanquished our foes."

 feo_balkan_conquest_title:0 "Basileus of the Balkans"
 feo_balkan_conquest_desc:0 "The Balkans were one of the more important regions of the old Byzantine Empire. Whilst it is a mountainous area, some of its wealth cannot be underestimated. Let us prepare a campaign to reclaim this lost Byzantine land."

 feo_rival_genoa_title:0 "Genoese Relations"
 feo_rival_genoa_desc:0 "The arrival of the Genoese forever shook our position in Gothia. Many foreign merchants have been buying land off us, and have reduced our coastal influence to but a single port. Maybe it is time we try and combat this threat, either with the sword or with the pen."

 feo_break_italian_control_title:0 "Dealing With the Italians"
 feo_break_italian_control_desc:0 "Gothia's coastal influence has been in tatters for far too long. If we are to ever stand a chance at reclaiming our status in the Black Sea, the Italians must be pacified, or destroyed."

 feo_gothia_title:0 "Gothia Ascendant"
 feo_gothia_desc:0 "The Hordes and the Italians have been dealt with. Our principality which started from the city of Mangup is now more than just that. We can finally start the next step of our nation's ambitions: Restoring Gothia."
 feo_gothia_ascendant_pp:0 "Gothia Ascendant"

 feo_aegean_supremacy_title:0 "Aegean Supremacy"
 feo_aegean_supremacy_desc:0 "What are merchants but selfish chancers? And what would selfish chancers in the Aegean want other than complete control? Securing the Aegean Islands, or fortifying its coast will allow us to reign supreme against our rivals and enemies that may reside there."

 feo_azov_sea_title:0 "Question of Azov"
 feo_azov_sea_desc:0 "The province of Azov in Crimea is one of the most vital ports in the Black Sea. Developed by the Italians as their main haven for conducting trade, it is a threat to our Black Sea domination plans. Perhaps then, it is time for some merchant-to-merchant conversation...."

 feo_conflits_in_lithuania_title:0 "Plains of Ruthenia"
 feo_conflits_in_lithuania_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Steppes has brought us many foreign riders, perhaps way too many for us to manage. By conquering Ruthenia, we may perhaps have the opportunity to settle some of them there."

 feo_gavras_triumphant_title:0 "Gavras Triumphant"
 feo_gavras_triumphant_desc:0 "We were but a humble merchant family years ago. Now, we sit atop a throne made of gold, triumphant over our Greek rivals. The rest of the world shall soon know of this accomplishment."

 feo_gothic_invasion_title:0 "Gothic Invasion"
 feo_gothic_invasion_desc:0 "Gothia may have returned, but the Gothic ways have not. Germany has yet to be conquered. The kings and Queens there have yet to bend their knees to us. Then, we shall make them knee using the sword."

 feo_crimea_title:0 "Crimean Oppressors"
 feo_crimea_desc:0 "The Crimean people have been a thorn in our side for many decades. Always raiding our border, and sometimes sponsoring invaders like Tamerlane to raze our land. Blood and ash shall be the only tribute they receive."

 feo_beyond_crimea_title:0 "Into the Steppes"
 feo_beyond_crimea_desc:0 "Our Crimean campaign was a major success, as we have dealt with two birds using one stone. Now, it is time we push even deeper into Steppe territory, using our now seasoned warriors to bring us victory."

 feo_integrate_cossacks_title:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$'s Vanguard"
 feo_integrate_cossacks_desc:0 "The Tatars may have been an enemy once, but one cannot deny their prowess in battle. Instead of eliminating them, perhaps we can use them in our society or in our ranks."

 feo_caucasia_title:0 "Gateway to the Middle East"
 feo_caucasia_desc:0 "Caucasia is a mountainous area, perfect for us to use against anyone that may invade us from the Middle East. We shall make sure that our soldiers secure these mountainous passes."

 feo_russian_aristocracy_title:0 "A Russian Aristocracy"
 feo_russian_aristocracy_desc:1 "We may be of Greek origin, but much of our aristocracy has major connections to the families in Russia. It may be best if we use these connections to secure new allies, but it may also be worthwhile to use them in order to claim the land for ourselves."

 feo_steppe_development_title:0 "Settling the Goths"
 feo_steppe_development_desc:0 "The Steppes are filled with foreigners, which are unreliable for bringing profit to our realm. Settling some of our people there to create cities would help fix that problem."
 
 feo_russian_aid_title:0 "Russian Aid"
 feo_russian_aid_desc:0 "Our newfound allies in the North have been of great help so far. However, our local manpower has always been scarce and our officers unreliable. Perhaps by asking them to send some officers to help us, we can knock out one of these problems."
 
 feo_russian_guard_title:0 "Guards of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 feo_russian_guard_desc:0 "The Gothic people are limited, and we have so far relied on foreign recruits, who are not as disciplined as those of our Russian brothers. Requesting them to send a small guard of elites would help with this problem."

 flavor_feo.2.t:0 "Successors of Rome?"
 flavor_feo.2.d:0 "There have been many Emperors before us. Some led glorious lives, reclaiming territories once held by Rome, whilst some were the reason for its downfall. With us now standing inside the Hagia Sophia, it is time we make a decision. Shall we carry on this Roman legacy, or shall we perhaps choose a different path?"
 flavor_feo.2.a:0 "We are the true successors of the Byzantine Empire!"
 flavor_feo.2.b:0 "We are not Rome's successor, but rather we are the remnants of the Goths."

 flavor_feo.6.t:0 "One With the Tatars"
 flavor_feo.6.d:0 "Years of intermixing with the Tatar people has led to many of our officers wanting to integrate them within our ranks, part of our cavalry force, as they are some of the most formidable riders we have ever met. Whilst they may be correct, that would also lead to many of them abandoning their lives in the Steppes, not contributing to the nation by administrating their lands."

Shall we maintain our status as rulers of [Root.GetName], or shall we rule as a dual monarchy?"
 flavor_feo.9.a:1 "The Rus will be part of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_feo.9.b:0 "We will be both the Gavras and the Khovras."

 #Events
 flavor_hsn.1.t:0 "The Ayyubid Restoration"
 flavor_hsn.1.d:0 "The Ayyubid Empire once stretched far and wide and stood as the lion of Islam and the custodian of the Holiest Cities. Saladin's successors, unable to honor his legacy, have weakened the Sultanate, and the unfortunate turn of events led to its collapse. We have been stagnating ever since, however, our recent campaigns of conquest prove that the eagle's wings have not been broken yet. With our hearts set on restoring the glory of our ancestors, we march forward, for we are the bloodline of Saladin, and his legacy is ours to reclaim!"
 flavor_hsn.1.a:0 "The Eagle Takes Flight Once Again!"
 flavor_hsn.2.t:0 "Fate of the Mamluks"
 flavor_hsn.2.d:0 "Egypt, once the heartland of our Empire, has for centuries been controlled by the Mamluks, who had once been our most loyal soldiers, then turning into traitors who caused the downfall of our Sultanate. As we have managed to reclaim much of our rightful lands, we now face the difficult question: how shall we address the Mamluks? Is it possible to forgive them for their betrayal so that they may once again serve our dynasty, or shall we dismantle them once for all and rely only on our regular armies?"
 flavor_hsn.2.a:0 "We must seek reconciliation"
 flavor_hsn.2.b:0 "We can no longer trust them!"
 flavor_hsn.3.t:0 "The Title of Khalifa"
 flavor_hsn.3.d:0 "Centuries ago, the great Salah ad-Din switched Egypt's allegiance to the Abbasids, which resulted in a major shift, since previously, Egypt had been dominated by the Shiite Fatimids. Since his ascension to power, our rulers have upheld the authority of the Abbasid Caliphs, granting them respect and allegiance as the spiritual leaders of Islam. Since our resurgence, we have grown to become a significant force in the Islamic world; gaining military prowess, skillful governance, and admiration of loyalty of the masses. As our Sultanate stretches far and wide, controlling the most important cities of Islam, the temptation to assert our own claims to the Caliphate grows. Although many advise us to uphold the Abbasid authority, many others believe that claiming the Caliphate will lead to the path of unparalleled greatness. The decision must be made."
 flavor_hsn.3.a:0 "We shall respect the Abbasid authority!"
 flavor_hsn.3.b:0 "We will claim the mantle of Muhammad for ourselves!"
 flavor_hsn.5.t:0 "Legacy of Saladin"
 flavor_hsn.5.d:0 "The tales of Saladin's military genius echo through the ages. His tactical prowess on the battlefield and his diplomatic acumen during the Third Crusade have left an indelible mark on the world. As the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty and led it to great victories, including the recapture of Al-Quds from the hands of the Crusaders, ending nearly nine decades of occupation by the Franks. As our dynasty aims to restore the greatness that once was, the legacy of Saladin beckons us. How shall we honor his heritage?"
 flavor_hsn.5.a:0 "Our advisors must study his tactics"

 flavor_hsn.6.d:0 "When the great Salah ad-Din passed away, his earthly remains were placed into the newly built Mausoleum that was constructed adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Over the centuries, the place has deteriorated and is anything but a worthy resting place for such an important person. It should be in our best interest to renovate this tomb."
 flavor_hsn.6.a:0 "Inshallah, we will restore it"
 flavor_hsn.6.b:0 "We need resources elsewhere"
 flavor_hsn.7.t:0 "Solidifying Egypt"
 flavor_hsn.7.d:0 "Before its fall to the Mamluks, the region of Egypt had been the heart of our empire. It was here where Saladin seized power from the Fatimids and founded our glorious dynasty, so the region's importance for our dynasty cannot be overlooked. As we now control Egypt's most important cities, some are suggesting that we should consider moving our capital to Egypt in order to further solidify our rule over the region. After all, [361.GetName] had already served as our capital for decades. What shall we do?"

 flavor_ven.40.d:0 "Tiziano Vecellio, more commonly recognized as Tiziano, stands out as a distinguished painter from the Italian Renaissance, born in Pieve di Cadore, in proximity to Venice. Renowned for his adept handling of color and groundbreaking brushwork techniques, Tiziano's artistic journey spans over seven decades. Throughout this extensive period, he crafts an extensive array of works encompassing portraits, mythological narratives, and religious compositions. Notable among his portraits, such as 'Portrait of Charles V' and 'Venus of Urbino,' is the acclaim they receive for their profound psychological depth and opulent color schemes. Tiziano's impact on the evolution of both Venetian and European art is deep-seated, and his enduring legacy positions him as one of the foremost painters of the Renaissance."

 flavor_ven.41.d:0 "During the Renaissance in Venice, art and architecture reached new heights of sophistication and splendor. Venetian art, characterized by luminous color and emotional depth, was exemplified by the works of renowned painters like Tiziano, Tintoretto, and Veronese. These artists excelled in capturing the essence of their subjects through vibrant palettes and striking chiaroscuro techniques, which lent their creations an unparalleled sense of realism. Portraiture was a central theme, with artists achieving remarkable character portrayals. Additionally, allegorical and mythological subjects became popular, showcasing Venetian art's diverse range and emotional resonance.\n\nIn the realm of architecture, Venice's unique position as a trade hub between East and West left an indelible mark on its Renaissance structures. Venetian Gothic architecture combined intricate tracery and pointed arches with Byzantine and Oriental influences. This fusion is strikingly evident in iconic structures like the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica. As the Renaissance progressed, the Palladian style, championed by architect Andrea Palladio, introduced classical symmetry, columns, and pediments into the city's architectural vocabulary. Venetian palazzos along the picturesque canals, adorned with ornate facades and courtyards, became emblematic of the city's opulence. Together, Venetian art and architecture during the Renaissance reflect the city's unique cultural synthesis and continue to captivate enthusiasts worldwide."

Over time, the Carnival evolved into a grand and unique event, gaining popularity in the 15th century. During this period, Venice's status as a major trading hub in Europe allowed it to accumulate considerable wealth. This prosperity fueled the extravagance of the Carnival. It became a symbol of Venice's opulence and decadence, attracting visitors from all over Europe who were eager to participate in the masked festivities. The masks worn during the Carnival not only provided anonymity but also served as a way to erase social distinctions, allowing people from different backgrounds to mingle freely during the celebrations.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Venice Carnival reached its zenith, characterized by elaborate costumes, theatrical performances, and intricate mask designs. However, in 1797, the Carnival was banned by the occupying French forces, and it remained dormant for nearly two centuries. It wasn't until the late 20th century that the Carnival was revived, becoming the internationally renowned event it is today. Today's Venice Carnival preserves the traditions of the past, featuring stunning masks and costumes, street performances, and a vibrant atmosphere, making it a captivating and nostalgic journey into the city's rich history and culture."

 flavor_ven.44.d:0 "Francesco Foscari's leadership as Doge of Venice from 1423 to 1457 was a period of both accomplishments and challenges. His rule oversaw Venice's territorial expansion in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, enhancing its maritime and trade influence. However, it was also marked by internal conflicts and growing discord among the city's elite. Foscari's persistent pursuit of war against the Republic of Milan strained Venice's resources, while the influential Council of Ten encroached on his authority, leading to the banishment of his own son for corruption. In 1457, Foscari resigned and died in exile, a poignant episode that inspired literary and artistic works, most notably Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari.\n\nThe authority of Venice's Doges underwent a significant transformation through the centuries. In the early days of the Venetian Republic, these leaders wielded substantial political and military power. However, by the 15th century, their role had shifted to become more symbolic and ceremonial, as the influential Council of Ten, responsible for state security matters, increasingly constrained the Doge's decision-making. The Doge's duties centered on representing Venice in formal settings, receiving foreign envoys, and presiding over ceremonies. Actual political influence lay dispersed among various councils, noble families, and institutions like the Great Council, embodying Venice's distinctive system of governance characterized by checks and balances, ensuring that no single figure, even the Doge, could exercise absolute authority and thereby fostering stability and averting authoritarian rule."

Originally conceived as a fortress-like edifice, the palace evolved over time into a magnificent representation of Venetian Gothic architecture. This architectural marvel served the dual purpose of being both the residence of the Doge, the preeminent political leader of the Venetian Republic and housing various government offices and courts.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Doge's Palace had undergone substantial renovations and expansions, resulting in a significant augmentation of its grandeur. One of the most remarkable developments was the completion of its iconic façade, which faced the Grand Canal, showcasing the palace's architectural splendor to all who approached by water. This period of renovation and expansion further solidified the palace's status as an enduring symbol of Venetian power and authority. Its halls and chambers, characterized by intricate designs and opulent decorations, not only bore witness to centuries of political activities but also stood as an enduring testament to the city's rich history and continued significance on the global stage."

 flavor_ven.46.d:0 "During the 15th and 16th centuries, theater in Venice was a vibrant and influential cultural phenomenon. The city was home to some of the earliest permanent theaters in Europe, such as the Teatro di San Cassiano, which opened in 1637, and the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio in 1580. These venues hosted a wide range of theatrical performances, including plays, operas, and comedies, attracting both locals and tourists. Venice's unique position as a major maritime and trading hub allowed for the exchange of artistic ideas and influences from across Europe, contributing to the development of Venetian theater as a rich and diverse form of entertainment that played a pivotal role in the history of European drama and performance arts."

Figures like Girolamo Brusoni and Ferrante Pallavicino, among others, are associated with this covert group, marked by its use of subterfuges like paradox and allegory to avoid criticism. Operating discreetly, members often employ secret language and publish anonymously, with their philosophy influenced by Trajano Boccalini, embracing Aristotelian naturalism from the University of Padua.\n This clandestine academy, despite facing censorship and finding its works on the Index, boldly challenges societal norms through satirical compositions and hybrid genres. Shaped by the ideologies of Machiavelli, Paolo Sarpi, and others, they critique tyranny in historical writings. Surprisingly, the Accademia degli Incogniti becomes a key force in advancing musical theatre in Venice, establishing the Teatro Novissimo."

These oaths included commitments to administer justice impartially, uphold state secrets, and execute decisions of the Great Council. They also imposed constraints on the Doge's powers, such as prohibiting direct correspondence with foreign leaders and interference in the election of the Patriarch of Venice. Over time, the promissione became increasingly comprehensive and was eventually printed, with documents for different Doges growing in length, ranging from 108 to 301 pages. To prevent the office from becoming hereditary, restrictions extended to the Doge's relatives, barring them from certain councils and positions. Although some restrictions were eased in the later years of the Venetian Republic, significant limitations remained in place, even for the Doge's family members. The oaths also included provisions regarding the Dogaressa, including her attire and ceremonial duties."

Now, with the Burgundian yoke destroyed, these Trade Cities have picked up arms in a shared cause: the unification of the Low Countries. They set out to conquer city by city, eventually forming a state of their own."

 flavor_hol.201.t:0 "The Shifting Winds of Trade"
 flavor_hol.201.d:0 "Merchants from the Hanseatic League used to wield tremendous amounts of power and prestige. With the League's monopoly on the grain trade of the North, none dared oppose their formidable and well-fed armies. However, all things change and time is mastered by none. As a result, the grip of the Hansa on the grain trade has withered, giving birth to the beginning of the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Era and a marvelous influx of foreign trade."

 flavor_hol.203.t:0 "Doctorate Rights in the Netherlands"
 flavor_hol.203.d:0 "Despite the generous amount of literate individuals around our urban environments, for centuries the rights to granting doctorate degrees were exclusively and zealously guarded by the nobility.

 flavor_hol.203.a:0 "Education should be affordable and accessible for all!"

 flavor_hol.204.t:0 "The Port of Amsterdam"
 flavor_hol.204.d:0 "The first port activities in Amsterdam date back to the 13th century. The port was first mentioned in the year 1342 when the city of Amsterdam received city rights. Recently, in the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Age, the port has been transformed into one of the main harbors of the [Root.GetAdjective] East India Company and our operations around the globe.

 flavor_hol.204.a:0 "The staple of our golden era!"

 flavor_hol.205.t:0 "Rembrandt van Rijn & the [Root.GetAdjective] Arts"
 flavor_hol.205.d:0 "As is often customary and expected, coin and a golden era of maritime exploration are swiftly followed by an uptick in literacy, education, and arts. One of the most influential men of the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Age, Rembrandt is an innovative and prolific master of painting, printmaking, and more. He is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in [Root.GetAdjective] art history. Unlike most [Root.GetAdjective] masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art come in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that we have eloquently dubbed the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Age, when [Root.GetAdjective] art (especially [Root.GetAdjective] painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, has become extremely prolific and innovative and is giving rise to important new genres."
 flavor_hol.205.a:0 "Painting is the grandchild of Nature..."

 flavor_hol.206.t:0 "Powerhouse in the Book Trade"
 flavor_hol.206.d:0 "As our urban centers dominate the markets, attracting visitors and passers-by that purchase our goods from all around the globe, one unforeseen side-effect of that is the increased production and consumption of books across our grand nation! Large books, pocket-sized books, cookbooks, and scientific papers, a wave of thought and intelligent growth is sweeping across our nation!"
 flavor_hol.206.a:0 "A room without books is like a body without a soul."

 flavor_hol.207.t:0 "The Father of Modern Education"
 flavor_hol.207.d:0 "Jan Amos Comenius, a Czech philosopher, pedagogue, and theologian, holds the title of the current bishop of the Unity of the Brethren. His journey from religious refugeedom to becoming a pioneer of universal education is well-known. In his renowned work, Didactica Magna, he formally introduced the concept. As both an educator and theologian, he currently guides schools and provides counsel to governments throughout non-Catholic Europe, firmly establishing his influence in the mid-seventeenth century."

 flavor_hol.208.t:0 "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek"
 flavor_hol.208.d:0 "Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch entrepreneur and scientist thriving in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology, has emerged as a prominent figure.

 flavor_hol.209.t:0 "Jan Leeghwater"
 flavor_hol.209.d:0 "In [GetYear], Jan Leeghwater has emerged as a renowned Dutch architect, mill builder, and hydraulic engineer. His groundbreaking projects are reshaping cities and mills throughout the Dutch countryside. Leeghwater, a visionary, stands at the forefront, advocating for the reclamation of the Haarlemmermeer. This perilous lake, with its encroaching threat, endangers surrounding towns as villages are gradually swallowed. Amsterdam and Leiden, too, find themselves at risk, emphasizing the urgency of Leeghwater's transformative initiatives."

 flavor_hol.210.t:0 "Play of the Ages"
 flavor_hol.210.d:1 "Few among the greatest nations of our continent can claim to be a foremost literary figure of our time. One such man, Joost van den Vondel, has come to captivate the limelight with his works. His plays continue to captivate audiences, making them the most frequently staged productions. The epic Joannes de Boetgezant, centered on the life of John the Baptist, stands as the pinnacle of Dutch epics. Vondel's theatrical masterpieces, including the enduring Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, maintain a regular presence on the stage, notably with the annual New Year's Day performance. Keen to continue working well into his old age, Vondel's creativity knows no bounds."

 flavor_hol.211.t:0 "The Eating of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_hol.211.d:0 "War and poverty have taken our people apart as the war against our rivals bodes badly. Misery and misfortune have a tight grip upon our people as angry mobs roam the street demanding retribution for the incompetence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Despite our best efforts and the security of the Palatial Complex, the angry peasants broke into the gardens, and shortly after our dear ruler attempted to give one final deprived and ineffective speech about unity and love, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mistress was promptly crushed by the enraging masses. \n\nOnce the massacre was over, the unruly mob turned its gaze on [Root.Monarch.GetName] and reached out, like a mad animal. The body would later be cut up into pieces, parts of it were sold in the markets and some radical elements of the crowd would even drive their gnawing teeth into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]'s bare, succulent flesh. Such are the dangers of incompetent ruleship at times of war..."

For centuries, these people called Hungary their home and helped us build and protect it. Recently, however, the new ideas spreading throughout Europe are reshaping the understanding of a nation, and various ethnic groups living in our kingdom have embraced the modern concept of a nation, with their newfound identity, they are requesting political representation and various laws to protect their identities and languages. While many see this as a natural development and wish to guarantee the rights of all peoples living in Hungary, others see this situation as rather threatening, with a likelihood of increased political autonomy eventually leading to a territorial disintegration of the kingdom. It is high time we address this situation and choose our approach."

As feudal lords often opted for cruel and violent punishments of those who refused to pay the taxes, the situation became unbearable and it was just a question of time before a rebellion broke out. In Croatia, this harsh treatment by local barons and land disputes led to civil unrest, often resulting in armed conflicts. With the complaints of the oppressed unanswered, the rumors are spreading that the peasants of Croatia have united under the leadership of Matija Gubec, and are planning an open rebellion against our authority.

Her upbringing in the vibrant cultural milieu of Naples instilled in her a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities. Beatrice's marriage to Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1476 cemented her role as a key diplomatic figure in Renaissance Europe. Through her patronage, she fostered a thriving cultural exchange between Italy and Hungary, facilitating the transfer of artistic ideas, manuscripts, and scholars. In Hungary, Beatrice established a renowned court library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, which became a center for humanist learning and scholarship. Her patronage supported the work of prominent humanist writers and scholars, contributing to the intellectual flourishing of the Renaissance. Beyond her cultural endeavors, Beatrice played a crucial role in diplomatic affairs, acting as an intermediary between Italian city-states and Hungarian interests.

Born in Transylvania, Honterus was a scholar, humanist, and clergyman deeply influenced by the ideas of the Protestant Reformation. Educated in Germany and imbued with the spirit of Reform, he returned to Transylvania with a fervent dedication to spreading the principles of Protestantism. Under Honterus's influence, the Saxons of Transylvania began to embrace Protestant teachings, particularly Lutheranism. His eloquent preaching, scholarly writings, and tireless advocacy for Reform resonated with many within the Saxon community, leading to a gradual but significant shift away from traditional Catholicism. The conversion of the Saxons to Protestantism under Honterus's leadership had profound implications for the religious and cultural identity of Transylvania. His influence has grown so much that except for some minor areas that remain staunchly Catholic, almost all Saxon-inhabited regions of Transylvania have now embraced Protestantism."

The Bibliotheca Corviniana housed over 2,000 volumes, making it one of the largest libraries of its time. The significance of the Bibliotheca Corviniana extended beyond its impressive contents. It served as a hub for scholarly exchange and played a pivotal role in the dissemination of knowledge throughout Europe. Scholars from across the continent were drawn to the library, contributing to the intellectual vibrancy of the Renaissance.

He saw a land, a limitless land that he sought to conquer. The man's name is Moctezuma I, the second Emperor of the Aztec Empire. Although in the past the title of Emperor was only ceremonial, he transformed it into a proper title through the subjugation of his neighbors, as well as military crackdown of the other members of the alliance.\n\nWith this recent shift in power, he can now start chasing his dream. There are many threats around him, such as the Purepecha Empire, the Tlaxcalan Senate, the remnants of the Zapotec, and even the disunited Mayan lands.

With his conquests of the Mayan people, he strengthened the religious character all around the realm, increasing the amount of blood offered to the Gods. Now, all that is left is to once again sit upon his throne, as a legend that brought light and unity in this land plagued by conflict and darkness."

 flavor_inc.25.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the heir of the Sun and the representative of a line that traces back to the Gods. With such an authoritative rule, perhaps [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign could take on new goals & meanings. The status quo ought to be changed for the years to come."

 flavor_inc.26.d:0 "As the Inca do not have a concept of coin and mint, the tax paid to the state is done via selected labor. Depending on the local specialty, the tax can be paid by military servitude, toiling on land, creating idols for display in Cuzco, or weaving for the Nobles."

As a mummy, they will continue to live their past lives in their estates, with servants carrying out many of their tasks for them. Those servants will eat for them, drink for them, and transport them. The dead Sapa Inca is also entitled to hold onto his past estates. Unless someone is to remove them from the history, that is."
 flavor_inc.27.a:0 "Death is but a transition."

 flavor_inc.28.d:1 "Despite having concluded a great deal of reforms aimed at strengthening the rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the government and faith are constantly evolving, creating the need for further changes. As such, [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt the need to have changes made to the religious rites, increasing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority even at the cost of also spurring much unrest, giving pretenders a chance to depose the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 flavor_inc.29.t:0 "The End of History"
 flavor_inc.29.d:1 "On this day, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken the harshest of actions. In a classic Inca fashion, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has ordered the destruction of many Quipu records and the killing of the few who knew and could understand those records, essentially wiping out much of history. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is viewed as a Pachacuti, the Ground-Shaker, who has ruled the [Root.GetName] through a world-changing event."

 flavor_boh.15.d:0 "Although the Hussite Wars ended years ago, their legacy still resonates in the heart of our nation. The once fertile lands of the Bohemian Crown now bear the scars of immolation and destruction, a grim testament to the ferocity of the conflict. Famines, once strangers to our prosperous realm, have become frequent visitors, gnawing at the vitality of our people. The population, once teeming with life, has been drastically reduced, leaving vast tracts of land desolate and abandoned.\n\nYears have passed since the end of the war, yet the harsh effects can still be felt in every corner of our nation. The recovery is slow and painful, a constant reminder of the devastation that was wrought upon us. It will take decades, perhaps even generations before our nation fully recovers from the devastation caused by the Hussite Wars."

Its legacy is a beacon of hope and a source of inspiration for our people. Now, the time has come for us to proclaim ourselves as its rightful heirs - to once again form a vast realm that echoes the glory of Great Moravia, to carry forward its legacy towards a glorious future. Let us claim our birthright, for we are the heirs of Great Moravia, and its spirit lives on within us."

Falling prey to hostile incursions from all sides, the empire was reduced to a shade of its former self. The empire's fate was sealed by the rise of the Ottomans, who managed to take the remaining territories and force the Emperors in Constantinople into submission. The situation seemed hopeless, however, now that our victorious armies once again march through the streets of Constantinople, hope has returned for the Greek people. Our ancestors had proven to be worthy of ruling the Roman Empire, and now, we shall follow in their footsteps.

The Byzantine Empire never fully recovered from this disaster, and its decline accelerated over the centuries. Having avenged this humiliating defeat, we now march towards our ultimate goal - the restoration of the Byzantine Empire under Komnenian rule. Although the eventual dissolution of Ottoman statehood is a certainty, we must address the new reality of a Turkish-dominated Asia Minor. Perhaps instead of thirsting for revenge, we should reconcile with the local population, which might benefit us greatly in the long run."

 flavor_hab.25.d:0 "Burgundy in recent years has expanded into imperial land, specifically the Low Countries and the western border of our empire, laying claim to the lands of Lotharingia. With [Root.Monarch.GetName] now crowned as Duke of Burgundy, we may now decide what will be their fate."

 flavor_hab.25.b:0 "Their lands belong to us."

 flavor_hab.26.t:0 "The Last Knight"
 flavor_hab.26.d:0 "In an age of conflict and flame, Europe has been yet again plunged into war. The lands of [Root.GetName] stand in the middle of all this, facing enemies from all sides. In this age, [Root.GetName] has seen its first spark.\n\nMaximilian I of [Root.GetName] is perhaps the most renowned Holy Roman Emperor. His ambitions led to him securing much of Western Europe under the Habsburg dynasty, and his military reforms shaped how warfare was fought for centuries, giving birth to the Pike and Shot formation."
 flavor_hab.26.a:0 "He will lead the von Habsburgs to glory."
 flavor_hab.26.b:0 "The age of chivalry is dead."

 flavor_hab.27.t:0 "End of the Ottomans"

 flavor_hab.28.d:0 "With many land reforms passed, and much of the church's holdings under the crown, Franz Anton von Raab now turns his eyes to the second most problematic element for Austrian prosperity: the Nobility. He wishes to enact reforms that may anger them, but will completely abolish serfdom in our country and allow for much of our population to work on more profitable fields of the economy directly under us rather than serving the nobility."
 flavor_hab.28.a:0 "We will extend these reforms to the nobility!"
 flavor_hab.28.b:0 "Allow the nobles to maintain their influence."

 flavor_hab.29.t:0 "Conquest of France"
 flavor_hab.29.d:0 "The lands of France once belonged to Germans, under the Frankish Empire. The Carolingian division during the Treaty of Verdun made sure to split East and West Francia both in territory, law, and culture. Now that the French are under our rule as well, it is perhaps possible to integrate them back to the true successors of Charlemagne."

 flavor_hab.29.b:0 "Let us celebrate this victory."

 flavor_hab.30.t:0 "Founding a New Empire"

 flavor_hab.32.a:0 "A peaceful approach would be best."
 flavor_hab.32.b:0 "Let us remind them why we're crowned Emperors."

 flavor_hab.33.t:0 "Australia-Hungary?"
 flavor_hab.33.d:0 "With our colonies in Australia established, many native people there have started calling themselves subjects of Australia-Hungary.

 flavor_hab.33.a:0 "We will accept this new name."
 flavor_hab.33.b:0 "What? No."

 flavor_hab.34.t:0 "End of the Imperial Rule"
 flavor_hab.34.d:0 "With the dismantlement of the Holy Roman Empire, our advisors suggest that we abandon trying to restore Charlemagne's Legacy and instead try to unify Germany with the sword."
 flavor_hab.34.a:0 "The end of an era is here."

 flavor_hab.35.t:0 "Iberian Union"
 flavor_hab.35.d:0 "With the rise of many different threats around us, [union_target.GetName], our [union_target.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] brothers have proposed to us a union between our realms.

 MUG_religion_title:0 "Indian Syncretism"
 MUG_religion_desc:0 "As our rule in India continues, the aspects of our religion,  especially the Sufi elements, tend to mix together with local Hindu traditions.

 MUG_land_assessment_title:0 "General Land Assessment"
 MUG_land_assessment_desc:0 "Administrative penetration has always been the great problem of any great Indian empire. Taxing the vast riches of Hindustan is not only a problem of having the military power or authority to do so. It is also to a large degree a question of measuring, assessing, and mapping what sources of revenue exist within our borders.\nA general land assessment of all territory under our control would likely benefit us tremendously, even if it would also be a great undertaking."

 MUG_rajputana_desc:1 "Rajputana is not a rich land, and the many petty princes there would never pose a danger on their own. But Rajput dynasties once ruled Northern India and their kinsmen are still very commonplace as minor rulers throughout the region.\n\nIn order to build a lasting empire we must make the Rajput Kings and Princes learn that they must either bow to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or face the full might of the Mughal Army."
 MUG_berar_title:0 "Across the Vindhyas"
 MUG_berar_desc:1 "The Malwa plateau is a good base of operations for expansion into Southern India and the vast region between us and the Tamil Country known as Deccan. This region is in many ways quite different from what we are used to. Many have desired the fabled diamonds of Golconda or the rich trading cities of the Coromandel Coast, but in order to get there we must scale mountains, and jungles, defeat the native kingdoms, and ultimately be ready to rule what the Delhi sultans never could.\n\nIt is time we crossed the Vindhyas."

 MUG_fatehpur_sikri_desc:1 "Our realm is one of many faiths and has been so since its very conception. Relying on the loyalty of just our co-religionists has therefore always been out of the question. We must instead promote religious discussion and debate so that any differences can be settled in a more peaceful manner.\n\nLet us build a new capital, near the great city of Agra, a wonder of Mughal architecture to display the full glory of our dynasty, but also designed to hold the many faiths of our empire. A specifically created house of worship for religious debates between Jains, Hindus, Christians, Zoroastrians, and any other faith within our borders will allow us to fully explore the spiritual world."

 MUG_malwa_title:0 "Conquer Malwa"
 MUG_malwa_desc:1 "With the fall of the fortresses in western Rajputana the rich Malwa plateau now lies open before us. The conquest of this region would both enlarge the Imperial treasury and open for future campaigns against Gujarat and the Deccan states.\n\nIt is our fortune that the Malwa Sultans have been weak and allowed local interest groups too much free rein. This has left the area divided and easy to integrate for a more efficient state such as ours."
 MUG_maidan_title:0 "Control the Desh"

 MUG_western_allies_title:0 "Western Allies"

 MUG_bengal_title:0 "Bengal Entrepot"
 MUG_bengal_desc:1 "The Ganges Delta has been a focal point for trade and commerce for thousands of years. Here eastern traders market their wares to the Indian public, while goods from all over northern India can flow in the other direction.\n\nThe recent arrival of western traders has, if anything, further accentuated this dynamic, and trade cities have begun to spring up all over the delta. We must further encourage this development and foster the growth of a major entrepot here in Bengal under our supervision."
 MUG_orissa_title:0 "Conquest of Orissa"
 MUG_orissa_desc:1 "Nestled between the Garjats and the Bay of Bengal the eastern coastline of Orissa is perhaps not as rich or wealthy as Coromandel further south.

 MUG_coromandel_title:0 "Fall of Coromandel"
 MUG_coromandel_desc:0 "The Coromandel Coast now lies before us. It has been a major center for Indian trade for hundreds if not thousands of years. Here foreigners from east and west established trade posts and factories, bringing great amounts of the silver our economy needs. The expensive textiles, spices, gemstones, pearls, and manufactured goods that they seek to bring to their homelands are also easy to find in this region which is home to great Tamil and Telugu cities with a strong heritage of industry and trade."
 MUG_malaya_both_title:0 "Malaccan Viceroyalty"

This great road connects the important cities of Hindustan, from Bengal to Kabul.\n\nWe must renovate the Grand Trunk Road, and spare no expense in its maintenance.

 MUG_afghan_frontier_title:0 "Afghan Frontier"
 MUG_afghan_frontier_desc:1 "Kabulistan and Sistan have long been the staging areas for those that would invade India.

 MUG_tripura_title:0 "Follow the Brahmaputra"

 MUG_ayutthaya_desc:0 "The city of Ayutthaya - or Ayuddhya - is perhaps the greatest of the cities of South East Asia but it is not the extent of our ambition in the region.

 MUG_china_title:0 "Open China"
 MUG_china_desc:1 "Our recent expansion has put us at the border of the Empire of China. The Middle Kingdom was always a distant giant. A country of as much wealth and population as the entire Indian subcontinent put together but where India was often fractured, China was stable and centralized.\n\nThe Chinese seem unwilling to engage with us on our terms, but we must not let them dictate rules for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the mighty Mughal Empire.
