The 12th and 13th centuries, however, saw a gradual weakening of the Popes' secular control, and dozens of local rulers came to power through various means. While most of these lands are still nominally within the Papal dominion and acknowledge some degree of temporal authority of the Holy Father, they nonetheless act in all matters as practically independent nations. \n \n(Autonomous Papal States may be converted into normal vassals through a special Papal diplomatic action)"

 tanistry_reform_desc:0 "Tanistry is the traditional inheritance system of Ireland and Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the descendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inherit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a competent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between cousins."

Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralization of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."

 norman_lordship_reform_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for military service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland.

Even worse, there is talk that some of our holdings in Ireland may join with these usurpers, plunging our holdings in Ireland into civil war!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA2:0 "Reclaim our land at once!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTB2:0 "This slap in the face will have to go unanswered, for now..."
 btpIRE.EVTNAME3:0 "An Independent Government"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC3:0 "Our government, now independent from British control, faces many unique challenges. It must now reform and reorganize itself and, bereft of its former mandate to represent foreign interests in Ireland, reevaluate its priorities. Only time will tell will come from this metamorphosis, but whatever it may be, at least Ireland will now be free!"

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME1:0 "Faroese Culture Emerges"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC1:0 "A unique and distinct language and culture evolved from Old West Norse on the Northern Isles, know as Faroese and Norn. While initially still mutually intelligible with Norwegian, it slowly drifted away as Norway came more and more under the influence of Danish and East Norse, while the inhabitants of the Northern Isles maintained older traditions and even borrowed from nearby Gaelic traditions."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA1:0 "Concerning news."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME4:0 "Distinct Norse-Gaelic Culture Fades"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC4:0 "The Gall-Ghaeil, or foreign Gaels, so called because they were ethnically Norse but culturally Gaelic, were once a dramatically different people than their native neighbors. As time wore on, however, the traditions and traits which defined them gradually faded and merged with their Gaelic allies. By the end of independent Norse-Gaelic kingdoms in Britain and the annexation of the Lordship of the Isles, these Norse-Gaels were quickly becoming indistinguishable from their Highland Scottish kin."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA4:0 "This should help the economy."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME7:0 "Fate of the Spanish Moors"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC7:0 "In a foolish decision of faith over economy, [From.GetName] have caused many of the Moors still living in their lands to leave."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME8:0 "Rise of the Republic of Salé"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC8:0 "The unruly population of the coastal estuary of the Wadi Sala has announced the intention to found a republic, funded by very successful pirating endeavors against European trading routes. We could either allow this minor republic, and try to exercise some control over it, or forbid it at risk of open rebellion."

 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC1:0 "From at least the 12th century, Brugge was the richest and most important port in the North Sea. However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a center of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."

 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC1:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation, despite immense pressure from the Protestant Ascendancy and a series of Penal Laws designed to force the acceptance of Protestantism and the Church of Ireland. The continued attempts of the English, British, and Anglo-Irish to convert the Gaels led to many rebellions from the very start of the Reformation. Occasionally, however, a deal was struck that the Irish would be allowed to maintain their Catholicism in exchange for a pledge of loyalty to Dublin or London."

 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC3:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation. The abject failure of the Reformation to take hold in Gaelic Ireland is attributed to a variety of factors, foremost amongst which may have been the fact that, contrary to most other Reformist and Protestant movement in Europe, the Church of Ireland refused to make use of the local language, instead disseminating materials in English. Combined with Ireland's disillusionment with England's foreign policy this created the perception that the Reformation was yet another attempt to conquer Ireland and break Gaelic influence. Another important factor, however, was support and training from continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a religiously unified British Isles.\n\nAll the more was our surprise to learn that the Reformation had taken taken hold in [Root.GetName].

 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The time has come to select a new Tanist from the available Righdamhna, or Kingly Material. All Dearbhfhine, the male descendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately ascend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the descendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inherit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a competent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.

As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty.

Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestock. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance.

 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTDESC1:0 "Today a brave young soul, low-born but ambitious, presented himself at the capital with the hope that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will grant him and a small group of followers land in the New World. With our ambitions in the New World widely known and the perceived lack of opportunities for advancement to those not born into wealth and position in [Root.Owner.GetName], he presumes to ask for land overseas in unclaimed territory.\nThis pioneer and his group of followers have even amassed a small sum, enough to purchase their own passage and start their new life, and only await your permission to grow our borders!"
 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTOPTA1:0 "Excellent, allow this group to depart immediately!"
 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTOPTB1:0 "We cannot afford to support this simpleton's dreams. Send him away!"

 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTNAME1:0 "Canadian Culture"
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTDESC1:0 "The early French settlers in Canada came largely from the north and west of France, but once in the New World, the colonists soon established their own culture and traditions. Influenced by Algonquian and Huron natives, and shaped by the harsh realities of their frigid new home, these settlers began to call themselves 'Canadiens'."

 tir_na_ngael_nation_desc:0 "The Gaelic peoples continue to maintain close ties on either side of the Sea of Moyle, but separated by geography and under the yoke of Germanic powers, the Gaels have slowly drifted apart. Now, however, we are finally poised to reunite all Gaels under the authority of the same High King in a true Tír na nGael, the country of the Gaels!"
 albion_nation_title:0 "Form Ynys y Cedyrn"
 albion_nation_desc:0 "Ever since the Saxons invaded and stole our ancient homeland from us, we have dreamed of recovering all of the Isle of Britain. Our ancient legends tell of Arthur's return to lead us to victory against the Saxons, but we cannot wait on legends to save us, for the glory of all Britons, let us found Ynys y Cedyrn, the Isle of the Mighty, and reclaim the whole of our beautiful island and beyond!"
 btpl_scottish_nation_title:0 "Form Scotland"
 btpl_scottish_nation_desc:0 "Hundreds of years of invasions and immigration has done nothing but make our great nation stronger. We may hold land on the fringes of Europe, but we are anything but irrelevant, and above all, we are free under Scotland the brave!"
 united_kingdom_nation_title:0 "Form United Kingdom"
 united_kingdom_nation_desc:0 "We have established a firm hegemony over all of the British Isles, but autonomous and sometimes rebellious vassals frustrate our plans whilst unnecessary local governments divert our taxes and complicate administration. We should unite our various kingdoms, once and for all, into a single, strong, and unified nation!"
 #Non-European Old World
 btpl_kabylia_nation_title:0 "Form Kabylia"

 #bt_armenia_formation_title:0 "Form Armenia"
 #bt_armenia_formation_desc:0 "Armenia, an ancient kingdom by any standard, once stretched over vast swaths of the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia. Armenians have since been displaced and marginalized, but we now stand ready to take the first step towards restoring Armenians to their rightful place of prestige. We now own enough of Greater Armenia to call our nation 'Armenia'!"         #This is crap, but I'm not feeling particularly creative at the moment

 embrace_irish_traditions_title:0 "Embrace Irish Culture"
 embrace_irish_traditions_desc:0 "When our ancestors were installed by the Anglo-Norman aristocracy hundreds of years ago, we were meant to represent English interests and curb local power, but Ireland has become our home. Gaelic traditions are observed, Irish is the language we hear spoken most often, and our closest allies and friends are the Gaels, not some distant English overlord. We should make this official!"
 create_the_kingdom_of_ireland_as_england_title:0 "Create the Kingdom of Ireland"
 create_the_kingdom_of_ireland_as_england_desc:0 "We have established dominance over Ireland, but we face the wrath of other European countries because of this annexation, and the rebellious nature of this frontier makes it difficult to govern effectively. The ideal solution may be to create a new Irish viceroyalty, similar to the former feudal system but significantly more organized, who may rule in our stead and protect our interests while distancing us from direct governance."
 cede_stragglers_to_koi_as_ruler_title:0 "Cede Irish Territory to Our Vassal"
 cede_stragglers_to_koi_as_ruler_desc:0 "We own land which de jure belongs to Ireland, our vassal kingdom. We may gift this land to them as a gesture of good will."

 #sweads_and_geats_one_big_happy_family_title:0 "Unify Swedish Culture"         #removed in 11.5
 #sweads_and_geats_one_big_happy_family_desc:0 "The two primary peoples of Sweden, the Swedes in the north and the Geats in the south, have lived together under the Swedish banner for many years and despite occasional friction, the two groups largely accept one another and recognize each other as kin. It is time we made it official and formally proclaim Swedes and Geats to be one and the same people, for the glory of Sweden!"         #removed in 11.5
 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_title:0 "Recognize young Marc'harid of Brittany as heir"
 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_desc:0 "Historically, women were able to inherit the duchy of Brittany, and our regnal histories proudly feature the names Janed, Alis, Bertha, and Hawiz, but per the Treaty of Guérande, which ended the War of the Breton Succession, we observe primarily Salic inheritance laws, forbidding women to inherit unless there is no surviving male in the entire line. Unfortunately, Fransez's infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pêr is also childless. The Montfort branch of the house of de Dreux is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognize Fransez's eldest daughter, Marc'harid, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."
 #bt_enforce_temporal_authority_title:0 "Enforce Temporal Authority"
 #bt_enforce_temporal_authority_desc:0 "The Papal States consist of many de facto independent rulers who barely acknowledge papal authority and contribute nothing to the Patrimonium Sancti Petri as a whole. We should begin the slow process of reintegrating these various smaller states into a united and strong state by clarifying the temporal as well as the spiritual authority of the Holy See and consolidating the Patrimonium Sancti Petri!"
 bt_declare_for_the_guelphs_title:0 "Declare Loyalty to the Guelph Cause"
 bt_declare_for_the_guelphs_desc:0 "The time has come for us to take a side in the protracted conflict for control of Italy! We should proclaim our loyalty to the Holy Father in Rome, who is rightful leader of both souls and bodies in Italy."
 bt_declare_for_the_ghibellines_title:0 "Declare Loyalty to the Ghibelline Cause"
 bt_declare_for_the_ghibellines_desc:0 "The time has come for us to take a side in the protracted conflict for control of Italy! We should proclaim our loyalty to the Emperor, the Pope may be the head of the Roman Church, but the Emperor is the rightful Roman Emperor."
 bt_betray_the_guelphs_title:0 "Betray the Guelphs"
 bt_betray_the_guelphs_desc:0 "While it may seem blasphemous, it has become clear that our place is not at the Pope's side in the Guelph-Ghibelline dispute. Let's betray the autocratic Holy See and proclaim our loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor!"
 bt_betray_the_ghibellines_title:0 "Betray the Ghibellines"
 bt_betray_the_ghibellines_desc:0 "While it may seem traitorous, it has become clear that our place is not at the Emperor's side in the Guelph-Ghibelline dispute. Let's betray the foreign throne and proclaim our loyalty to the Holy Father!"

 bt_abandon_guelph_ghibelline_dispute_desc:0 "This slow civil war has dragged on long enough! We should just be done with the constant fighting and recognize that our only path forward is neither under a corrupt church nor a greedy foreign king, but rather united against both!"

 restore_constantinople_decision_title:0 "Restore Constantinople"
 restore_constantinople_decision_desc:0 "The people of the great city of Constantinople have turned their backs on the one true faith and one of the greatest churches in Christianity, the Hagia Sofia, has been converted into a Mosque. This simply will not do! As residents of the capital of the former Roman Empire these citizens must set an example to all of Christendom, we must bring these errant subjects back into the fold of Christianity and restore the Hagia Sofia to a church!"
 restore_theme_graecia_title:0 "Restore the Theme of Greece"
 restore_theme_graecia_desc:0 "Now that we have restored the Theme system, we may set about reclaiming and reorganizing the Theme themselves. One of our first priorities must be to reorganize and gather our forces in our core territories in the Peloponnesos, Hellas, Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace."

 #Old World - Non European
 move_trade_to_mogador_title:0 "Move Trade to Mogador"
 move_trade_to_mogador_desc:0 "The ancient trading port of Safi no longer suits our purposes, and trade flows in and out of our many semi-autonomous ports largely outside of our control, and more importantly, outside of the reach of our tax collection. The solution is to create a new trading capital firmly under our control and give it a monopoly on all foreign trade. Let us hire the greatest architects and workers to create a beautiful, grand, new port!"

 btpl_unite_britain_desc:0 "For over a thousand years, at least from the time the Romans established Hadrian's wall and split Britain into north and south, the two halves have struggled for dominance over the small but rich island.

Despite occasional Roman victories, the advance of the Sultans and Beys has marched inexorably on, pushing our once great empire to the very gates of our great capital. It is now time to make a stand and turn the tide! If we are to stave off our certain destruction, we must hold the line here, push back the Turkish advance, and stabilize the capital region, lest all be lost."

 bt_establish_greenland_colony_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Erik the Red established the first European settlement in the New World, in Greenland.
