 #HOLY_ROMAN_EMPIRE: "Holy Roman Empire"
 #HOLY_ROMAN_EMPIRE_DESC: "The Holy Roman Empire was formed by the Frankish King Charlemagne, but would soon fall to the Eastern Frankish Duchies, ruled by Germans. These Germans had powerful realms and established a confederation with an elective King title. #Under Otto I, the German Confederation conquered Italy and claimed the title of Emperor of the Romans for themselves. Since then the Holy Roman Empire has struggled between successive dynasties fighting for control and the emperorship. With revolts and #rebellions shattering large realms. The minor actors in the Empire elected several rulers of weaker states as Emperor, weakening the Empire further. Since the 14th century the remaining dynasties fighting for the Throne were the Habsburgs, Wittelbachs and #the House of Luxembourg. With the Wittelbach's lands fractured and the House of Luxembourg dying out, the Habsburgs remain. Ruling from the lands of Austria. Will you challenge the Habsburg Emperors or will you bring them to glory?"
 #"The Holy Roman Empire were a collection of small states protected by the Emperor, an elective position which soon would fall to just the Habsburgs. Rise in the Empire and claim the Emperorship or challenge the Emperor and dismantle this travesty."
 #AMERICAN_TRIBES: "American Tribes"
 #AMERICAN_TRIBES_DESC: "The American Heartland is settled by native tribes who are unaware of their coming collapse. Are you able to unite a realm and defend yourself against the future invaders?"
 #AFTERMATH_OF_VARNA: "Aftermath of Varna"
 #AFTERMATH_OF_VARNA_DESC: "With the recent defeat of the Crusade of Varna, the faith of the Balkans has become grim. The Turks are expanding into Europe and resistance is weakening. The Military Leader of the Albanians, Skanderbeg is fighting the resistance #against the Ottomans while the Byzantine Empire is on its last legs."
 #STRUGGLEBRITAIN: "Struggle for the British Isles"
 #STRUGGLEBRITAIN_DESC: "For centuries the British Isles have been in turmoil. Viking invasions. The Norman Conquest of England and other actors have for a long time destabilized the region. But with the strengthening of the English power, they are becoming a #clear dominant force in the region. The Scottish threatened by the English have signed several alliances with the French Kingdom while the Irish are still feuding among each other. Will you be able to unite the region and dominate it?"
 #KALMAR_UNION: "The Kalmar Union"
 #KALMAR_UNION_DESC: "With the Danish Monarchs elected as Monarchs in both Sweden and Norway the Kalmar Union was established. With the intend to strengthen their internal and external affairs. The Hansa was dominating trade in the Baltics and with this new #Union the Scandinavians attempted to reassert control over the trade in this sea. But tensions remain. The Hansa remains strong while the Republic of Novgorod threaten them in the east. Swedish nobles have as well been unsatisfied with the Kalmar Union and #are likely to attempt to break free. Will you manage to secure peace or rise to dominate the other Scandinavian nations?"
 
 AMERICAN_TRIBES: "American Nations"
 AMERICAN_TRIBES_DESC: "For millennia, the American expanses have been home to sophisticated and diverse societies. From the Aztec Triple Alliance, to the Mayan City-States, the Incan mountain states to the Confederacies of the Huron and Iroquois, the nations of the Americas have proven themselves to be formidable, ingenious, and adaptable. With foreign peoples arriving on American shores, bringing with them new conflicts, diseases, technologies ,and ideas, every American way of life is at risk. Can you find a path free of the foreign imperialists? Or shall the Americas be subdued as colonies for powers an ocean away?"
 AFTERMATH_OF_VARNA: "Aftermath of Varna"
 AFTERMATH_OF_VARNA_DESC: "With the disastrous defeat of the Crusade of Varna, Ottoman aggression into Europe is left unchecked. Though Hungary may be up to the task of bulwark of Christendom, it too shall fall if unsupported. Rallying the peoples of the rugged and diverse lands of the Balkans is no easy task. Skanderbeg - leader of League of Lezhe - continues resistance in the foothills and passes of Albania. Wallachia lies subdued, Serbia in a cautious Turkish embrace, and the Dnieper is all that separates poorly-led Moldavia. In the City of the World's Desire, the Byzantine Empire ails while the Ottomans encroach from every angle. In the chaos after Varna, the path of history is left unto you."
 STRUGGLEBRITAIN: "Struggle for the British Isles"
 STRUGGLEBRITAIN_DESC: "For centuries the British Isles have been in upheaval. From Saxon incursions, Viking raids, to Norman invasions, and civil wars, the Isles have been tested. Yet through this crucible comes a rising English wind, with expansive holdings in prime continental territory. The Scottish, threatened by the growth of English power, have consistently maintained the Auld Alliance with France; though the fractious highland clanns have continued to resist central authority. To the west, the Irish clanns still feud amongst each other for the now-empty title of High King. Still, the British Isles act as the gatekeepers to the North Atlantic, and thus leverage over Europe in it's entirety. Will you fall once again to the foreign conquerors across the Channel, or will you build the largest empire in human history?"
 KALMAR_UNION: "The Kalmar Union"
 KALMAR_UNION_DESC: "With the election of Danish monarchs to both the thrones of Sweden and Norway - the Kalmar Union has been established - in an attempt to strengthen their control the North Sea, like in times of old. Though the Hansa dominates trade in the Baltic the Scandinavians are attempting to reassert wrest over the local trade to their benefit, increasing the tension in the North. With the shrewd merchants of the Hansa and the Veche Republic of Novgorod contesting the fringes of the union, Swedish nobles have become increasingly dissatisfied with their Danish overlords and yearn to break free. Will you maintain the unity of Scandinavia, or will set the frigid north on fire?"
 HOLY_ROMAN_EMPIRE: "Holy Roman Empire"
 HOLY_ROMAN_EMPIRE_DESC: "The Holy Roman Empire's throne has been contested between successive dynasties vying for control for centuries. With revolts and rebellions shattering the once large estates of the dukes, the minor actors in the Empire have been electing rulers of weaker states as Emperor, further weakening the entity's cohesion. Among those clamoring for the throne are the Habsburgs, Wittelbachs and the House of Luxembourg - once minor dynasties now risen to power. With the Wittelbach's lands fractured and the House of Luxembourg dying out, the Habsburgs appear positioned to take it all! Will you challenge the growing Habsburg clout and seize the throne for yourself, or look to a future without the Empire altogether?"

 EXPANDED_TRIBAL: "Tribus Universalis"
 EXPANDED_TRIBAL_DESC: "For those out there with supercomputers and a masochist desire for as many tribes and historical details as possible. \n\nWill crash potatoes. Will probably crash supercomputers. You have been warned."
 MAJOR_POWERS: "Plus Ultra"
 MAJOR_POWERS_DESC: "Europe, with its long coastlines and navigable rivers, fertile and defensible lands, diverse peoples and religions, has long been in conflict with itself. Throughout the Middle period, numerous local powers were able to amass increasingly centralized authorities, resulting in a new geopolitical landscape ripe for conflict in the Early Modern period. Take the helm of the Major Powers, chart the path of history or diverge and forge a new one. \n\nPerformance start.\nIdeal for Multiplayer games."

 #HOLY_ROMAN_EMPIRE_DESC: "The Holy Roman Empire was formed by the Frankish King Charlemagne, but would soon come under the dominion of the Eastern Frankish Duchies, ruled by the native Germanic people. These German dukes held powerful realms and, after breaking from the Frankish Empire, established a confederation, headed by an elective king. Under Otto I, this German Confederation conquered Italy and claimed the title of Emperor of the Romans for themselves, citing the fact that a woman could not be Kaiser and thus they were the true heirs of the Roman Empire. Since then the Holy Roman Empire's throne has been contested between successive dynasties vying for control and the emperorship. With revolts and rebellions shattering the once large estates of the dues. The minor actors in the Empire have since decided to elect several rulers of weaker states as Emperor, further weakening the Empire. Since the 14th century the major dynasties clamoring for the Throne were the Habsburgs, Wittelbachs and the House of Luxembourg. With the Wittelbach's lands fractured and the House of Luxembourg dying out, the Habsburgs remain. Ruling from their estates in Austria. Can you challenge the Habsburg hegemony, challenge the Emperor and dismantle this abomination or will you join to Spread the Habsburgs across Europe?"
 #"The Holy Roman Empire were a collection of small states protected by the Emperor, an elective position which soon would fall to just the Habsburgs. Rise in the Empire and claim the Imperial Throne or challenge the Emperor and dismantle this abomination."
