 IR_druze.1.desc:0 "The Druze faith incorporates elements of various different philosophies and beliefs that make up Druze theology. As a Druze ruler we can choose which Druze philosophy or school of thought to focus on. These last for the life of a ruler or until an event changes it. Each Druze nation starts out with three schools; Tajalli, Pythagorean and Platonic. Additional schools are unlocked by owning or bordering provinces of other religions."

 IR_druze_unlock.3.t:0 "Inner Knowledge"
 IR_druze_unlock.3.d:0 "Batin means hidden or inner knowledge and refers to the esoteric aspects of Islam that is prominent in the beliefs of certain faiths such as Alawites, Alevi's but also the Isma'ilism that much of Druze teachings originate from. We can now access the Batiniyya school of thought and focus more on this inner knowledge and esotericism that is so important to the Druze faith."
 IR_druze_unlock.3.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.4.t:0 "Taqiyya"
 IR_druze_unlock.4.d:0 "Taqiyya in Islam is a practice of self-defense, in which one conceals their religious beliefs in the face of oppression. Whilst as Druze we are considered Ahl al-Kitab or 'People of the book', we are often not treated as such and face persecution for our beliefs. Hence in order to defend ourselves and have better relations with neighboring countries, it could prove useful for our people to conceal some of our beliefs and assimilate more into the Islamic mainstream."
 IR_druze_unlock.4.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.5.t:0 "Gnosticism"
 IR_druze_unlock.5.d:0 "Druzism has many esoteric and gnostic elements to it which ties us together with various other similar faiths such as that of the Mandaeans who are said to have their origins in the levant and revere John the Baptist as a key figure in the religion, alongside baptism is part of their core beliefs, and so is the attaining of knowledge from their ancient scriptures written in Mandaic. Outside of that there are the Zoroastrians, followers of 'Ahura Mazda' or the 'Lord of Wisdom'. Zoroastrianism has a dualistic cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology predicting the ultimate conquest of evil by good. We can focus on the Gnostic influences on our faith and work towards improving ties with other Gnostic religions.."
 IR_druze_unlock.5.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.6.t:0 "Latin Christianity"
 IR_druze_unlock.6.d:0 "Many of the Christians around us, such as the Maronites and Catholic Melkites, whilst not part of the Latin church themselves, are in full communion with the Holy See. In addition over the years many of the Latin city-states have expanded their trading networks around the Eastern Mediterranean.. We could focus on Western philosophical tradition and strengthening our ties with the Christians of the West.."
 IR_druze_unlock.6.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.7.t:0 "Eastern Christianity"
 IR_druze_unlock.7.d:0 "For centuries Christianity, especially Orthodox Christianity, has had an immense influence in the Levant. There is a long history of coexistence and harmony between us and the Eastern Churches such as that of the the Melkites, Greek Orthodox Rum, Maronites, Armenians and many more.. Both of us venerate Jesus, John the Baptist, Saint George and other important figures, hence there is much to be gained by strengthening our relationship with the Christians of the East."
 IR_druze_unlock.7.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.8.t:0 "Judaism"
 IR_druze_unlock.8.d:0 "The Jewish people much like the Druze have been a persecuted minority for much of history. Many figures in the Hebrew Bible such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses are considered important prophets of God in the Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history. In Jewish scripture Jethro was Moses' father-in-law, to us Druze Jethro of Midian is considered a spiritual founder, chief prophet and ancestor of our people. We can focus more on the Judaic school of thought to bring our people closer together."
 IR_druze_unlock.8.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.9.t:0 "The Noble Eightfold Path"
 IR_druze_unlock.9.d:0 "We have stumbled upon followers of teachings of the 'Buddha'. Many Buddhist ideas and philosophies overlap with those of ours. They too believe in a cycle of rebirth which can be escaped through enlightenment. The Buddha is said to have reached that spiritual enlightenment, much like our founder Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah did with his disappearance.. According to his followers this spiritual enlightenment is achieved by following Buddhist practices part of 'The Noble Eightfold Path'"
 IR_druze_unlock.9.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.10.t:0 "Dharma"
 IR_druze_unlock.10.d:0 "We came across believers of Sanatana Dharma, or the eternal way. They value a virtuous and moral life, stability, and freedom from ignorance. While there are differences in how this occurs, reincarnation is a paramount tenet in both the Druze faith and the Dharmic faiths. They believe that life is part of a great cycle of birth and rebirth. Heaven to us is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, in the Dharmic faiths this can be achieved through good deeds known as 'karma'..."

 IR_druze_unlock.11.a: "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.12.t: "Pythagorean Philosophy"
 IR_druze_unlock.12.d: "The Pythagorean school of thought focuses on the theology and philosophy derived from Greek philosopher Pythagoras and his followers. Pythagoreans believed that the soul was buried in the body, which acted as a tomb for the soul in this life. The highest reward a human could attain is for the soul to escape the cycle of reincarnation. The fact that mathematics could explain the human sentimental world had a profound impact on the Pythagorean philosophy. Pythagoreanism became the quest for establishing the fundamental essences of reality. Pythagorean philosophers advanced the unshakable belief that the essence of all thing are numbers and that the universe was sustained by harmony."
 IR_druze_unlock.12.a: "Interesting..."

 IR_druze_unlock.13.t: "Platonic Philosophy"
 IR_druze_unlock.13.d: "The Platonic school of thought is based on the philosophy and theology derived from Plato and his followers such as the Neoplatonism espoused by Plotinus which underpins the mystical traditions in all three of the major Abrahamic religions." #WIP
