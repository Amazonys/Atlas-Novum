 tengri_events.24.t:0 "Religious Pilgrimages"
 tengri_events.24.d:0 "It has become customary among our nobles to travel to the holy places of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet and India to study and learn of the Buddhist faith. As they return bringing new customs and perspectives to our country our society is slowly changing. This is not always a process without problems but recently we have been seeing some very positive trends in our government as a result of this exchange."
 tengri_events.24.a:0 "Great!"
 tengri_events.25.t:0 "Land Theft"
 tengri_events.25.d:0 "With the increasing influence of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith in our country a number of new monasteries have been founded in our country. Their purpose is both to harbor the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] monks that have come to our lands and the slowly growing number of native [Root.GetAdjective] monks.\nTraditional landholders don't seem to be very impressed by the pretensions of these newcomers, however, and have been helping themselves to the lands reserved for the monks. The monks claim that the land would be made more productive under their control while the land holders feel they are demanding the right to what is already theirs."
 tengri_events.25.a:0 "We must support these orders!"
 tengri_events.25.b:0 "We must protect the traditional rights of our people."
 tengri_events.26.t:0 "Pali Legal Traditions"
 tengri_events.26.d:0 "With Theravada Buddhism comes an ancient legal tradition based on old Pali scriptures as well as the collected rulings of many judges and monarchs before up to this day. Some Theravada monks have found our lack of collected written rulings very disturbing and have sought our blessings to create a collection of up-to-date rulings that, together with the Pali Canon, could serve as a basis for future rulings in our country."
 tengri_events.26.a:0 "Allow the scholars to continue."
 tengri_events.26.b:0 "The Yassa is enough for us."
 tengri_events.27.t:0 "Pure Land Buddhism"
 tengri_events.27.d:0 "By adopting the Mahayana faith we have opened our borders to a wide range of traditions and teachings but none seem to have attracted as many followers as the promises of the 'Pure Land' movement has. Throughout [Root.GetName] subjects immersed in meditation and recitation have become an increasingly common sight."
 tengri_events.27.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 tengri_events.30.t:0 "Spread of Confucian Ideals"
 tengri_events.30.d:0 "Impressed by the refined and well-argued tenets of Confucianism many of our nobles have begun to strive to improve themselves through rigorous study and hard work. As a result we are not only becoming better at understanding the wider Confucian world but the administration of our land and resources has notably improved and above all become more consistent."
 tengri_events.30.a:0 "Recruit these men as administrators."
 tengri_events.30.b:0 "We can use this to purge corruption."
 tengri_events.30.c:0 "Let us encourage them to develop the land itself."
 tengri_events.31.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Beiles"
 tengri_events.31.d:0 "As the learned ideals of Confucian philosophy gain more and more ground among the [Root.GetAdjective] nobility [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by fears that our old ways are being forgotten. Many high ranking [Root.GetAdjective] dignitaries have taken to using foreign titles and names rather than the [Root.Culture.GetName] titles of our ancestors. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] worries that in a generation none will remember the old ways of the bow and horse and our nation will be one of weak scribes and poets."
 tengri_events.31.a:0 "No nation that has abandoned its own language can prosper!"
 tengri_events.31.b:0 "We have no reason to fear the Confucian Way."
 tengri_events.32.t:0 "Confucian Elites Alienated"
 tengri_events.32.d:0 "Participation in many traditional rituals is reserved for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. While this means the Confucian elite of our country cannot take part this has not often been a problem as they view such 'superstitious' rituals and sacrifices with at best mild displeasure. This insistence to keep our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his closest from the old [Root.Religion.GetName] elites separate from our other subjects has, however, led to an unnecessarily sharp divide between the two groups. This, rather than the rituals themselves, seems to be a constant source of irritation and misunderstandings, even at the very top of our society."
 tengri_events.32.a:0 "Praise the heavens!"
 tengri_events.32.b:0 "Let us device common rituals instead."
 tengri_events.33.t:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.33.d:0 "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years learning how to ride and shoot as the [Root.Culture.GetName] warriors of our past. This might not be the best way to take care of the growing abilities of [Root.Heir.GetName] however. Given the opportunity Confucian teachers promise to teach our heir how to better [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] and more importantly how to rule and make the most of our land and its subjects."
 tengri_events.33.a:0 "Let us hire Confucian teachers."
 tengri_events.33.b:0 "A traditional education is the only way."
 tengri_events.33.c:0 "We have no extra resources to spare for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 tengri_events.35.t:0 "Spread of the Tea Ceremony"
 tengri_events.35.d:0 "The elaborate Tea Ceremonies that are common in many Shinto lands have spread far further than the Shinto religion itself and are becoming commonplace in most [Root.GetAdjective] cities as well as among the members of our court."
 tengri_events.34.t:0 "Examination of Administrators"
 tengri_events.34.d:0 "The Chinese have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Confucian ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 tengri_events.34.a:0 "It is a risk we must take."
 tengri_events.34.b:0 "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 tengri_events.35.a:0 "Our courtly culture will never be the same."
 tengri_events.35.b:0 "Encourage the spread of the Way of Tea."
 tengri_events.36.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Loses Face"
 tengri_events.36.d:0 "The Shinto view of failure is somewhat different from that of our Tengri traditions. As Shinto values become an increasingly important part of our society the expectations on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] change.\nSome actions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come to be interpreted as lacking in both honor and ability by those who follow the syncretic mix of Shinto and Tengri customs that has come to take shape in our lands."
 tengri_events.36.a:0 "This is unfortunate."
 tengri_events.36.b:0 "The Shamans say I cannot be faulted."
 tengri_events.37.t:0 "Japanese Swordsmithing"
 tengri_events.37.d:0 "Opening up our realm to Shinto customs and culture have also resulted in an increasing migration of Shinto practitioners into our lands, among them a number of Japanese weaponsmiths. The Swords they produce have become increasingly popular with the richer parts of our society and Japanese smiths are becoming common in most of our cities. Many of our elite warriors have begun to train with these weapons.\nSome worry that this will mean the abandonment of the Martial traditions of our ancestors though even those that cling to the old ways have benefited from a greater understanding of foreign fighting techniques."
 tengri_events.37.a:0 "Encourage our elites to use these swords."
 tengri_events.37.b:0 "Bow and arrow is for the true Tengri warrior."
 tengri_events.38.t:0 "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d:0 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Coptic Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries, quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a:0 "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.38.b:0 "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.39.t:0 "Papal Embassy"
 tengri_events.39.d:0 "An official Papal embassy has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The task of the envoys is to judge the sincerity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to once again hear him accept the pope as the head of the church and to include [Root.Monarch.GetName] into the wider Catholic community.\nIn order to achieve this the envoys have brought with them a number of books, maps and learned men. Surely these men are also spies, eager to learn our secrets. It is also certain that our Shamans will disagree with any policy of bowing to a foreign head of religion and refusing them an audience would please them. But perhaps the knowledge these Catholics bring can make up for missing that opportunity."
 tengri_events.39.a:0 "Send these spies back home!"
 tengri_events.39.b:0 "We are loyal followers of the Roman Church."
 tengri_events.40.t:0 "Christian Missionaries"
 tengri_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries from abroad has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are eager to spread the word of God among the heathens. Not wanting to come into conflict with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, they come seeking our blessing. The leader of the group has approached the throne asking to be given the right to spread the Christian faith in a region under our control unhindered."
 tengri_events.40.a:0 "Let them go wherever they please."
 tengri_events.40.b:0 "Send them back where they came from."
 tengri_events.40.a.tt:0 "This province may come to change Religion in the future."
 tengri_events.40.c:0 "Prohibit them from converting Tengriists."
 tengri_events.41.t:0 "Spread of Christianity"
 tengri_events.41.d:0 "The missionaries in [Root.GetName] have made good progress towards converting the local population there. Shamans have become an increasingly rare sight and a number of churches dot the landscape."
 tengri_events.41.a:0 "Praise the Lord."
 tengri_events.42.t:0 "Conflicts between Shamans and Missionaries"
 tengri_events.42.d:0 "The presence of a mission in [Root.GetName] has led to a number of conflicts between the [Root.Religion.GetName] Shamans and the local Priests. Shamans have proclaimed curses over the priests and sometimes on entire congregations."
 tengri_events.42.a:0 "It is time for the missionaries to leave."
 tengri_events.42.b:0 "We must not interfere."
 tengri_events.43.t:0 "Christian Ruler Alarmed"
 tengri_events.43.d:0 "The adoption of Christianity beside the traditional [Root.Religion.GetName] faith of our ancestors has given rise to a number of less than orthodox customs. Syncretic rituals that reference both the god of Christianity and the gods of the sky have become commonplace and some have even been adopted at the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nWhile this seems to please most of our Christian subjects the delicate sensibilities of a Christian subject ruler visiting [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have been deeply upset by his forced participation in such rituals."
 tengri_events.43.a:0 "But they're both lords of heaven?"
 tengri_events.43.b:0 "Try to make amends."
 tengri_events.44.t:0 "Miracle"
 tengri_events.44.d:0 "Word has reached us of a remarkable wanderer. Drawing his power from his strong devotion to the Christian god he has managed to heal the weak and cure the sick. An increasing number of converts have begun to create congregations in his trail. Many still incorporate parts of their old Tengri customs in their daily life but this holy man has been more successful in attracting followers than many of the more traditional missionaries that now frequent our countryside."
 tengri_events.44.a:0 "Let him roam freely."
 tengri_events.44.b:0 "Invite him to Court."
 tengri_events.45.t:0 "Life at Court"
 tengri_events.45.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always taken a great interest in both our adopted religion and those that practice it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has, however, not always led a life that many of our Christian subjects would approve of. Between the influence of Shamans at court and the habits of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] there are many that feel we are risking divine punishment.\nPerhaps we should consider instituting some more clearly Christian rules for our court and ruler? Restricting the influence of Shamans, the number of allowed wives and generally the number of officially sanctioned rituals would go a long way towards placating the Christian communities."
 tengri_events.45.a:0 "A Christian court it is!"
 tengri_events.45.b:0 "Theses religions must coexist, side by side."
 tengri_events.45.b.tt:0 "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! faith will get §R6§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.46.t:0 "Brahmans and Shamans"
 tengri_events.46.d:0 "A battle of the minds and spirits of our people has ensued between Brahmin priests and Shamans, who consider themselves guides and protectors of our people. Lately heated discussions frequently end with Shamans cursing the Brahmins while the Brahmins turn to us, insisting that their hereditary status be respected."
 tengri_events.46.a:0 "Support the Brahmin Administrators."
 tengri_events.46.b:0 "Support our Shamans."
 tengri_events.46.c:0 "Avoid picking sides."
 tengri_events.47.t:0 "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d:0 "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact to a certain extent it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.47.a:0 "Great!"
 tengri_events.48.t:0 "Spread of the Caste System"
 tengri_events.48.d:0 "With the elevation of the Hindu faith a great number of Hindus have come to settle in many of our cities and with them the concept of caste is spreading into our lands. Interestingly it seems at least some of those that regularly do business with the Hindus as well as some of our Shamans have taken to this way to organize society.\nThe immediate effects seem hard to judge but for now everything seems to progress a bit more smoothly in [Root.GetName]."
 tengri_events.48.a:0 "Ok."
 tengri_events.49.t:0 "A Jewish Homeland?"
 tengri_events.49.d:0 "Word of our adoption of the Jewish religion has started to spread far and wide among the Jews of the Diaspora. A slow but increasingly steady trickle of immigrants have begun to appear at our borders, hoping to live and serve in a state where they are not confined to Ghettos or restricted by laws and prejudice."
 tengri_events.49.a:0 "Let them serve as administrators!"
 tengri_events.49.b:0 "Let them serve as soldiers!"
 tengri_events.50.t:0 "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d:0 "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a number of Zoroastrians in the diaspora. Ever since they left Persia behind almost a millennium ago they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.50.a:0 "'Like sugar in milk.'"
 tengri_events.50.b:0 "Best to keep them all in one place."
 tengri_events.51.t:0 "Growing Pantheon"
 tengri_events.51.d:0 "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of animist beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 tengri_events.51.a:0 "Great."
 tengri_events.52.t:0 "Support of the Shamans"
 tengri_events.52.d:0 "Court Shamans have always been an important institution in our state. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nobles participate in a wide range of ceremonies to ensure the gods looking favorable on our endeavors, be it going to war or sealing a strategic marriage. With the greatly increased numbers of Shamanic traditions we now patronize we can be sure of their support, a point not lost on our subjects."
 tengri_events.52.a:0 "The Gods favor our wars."
 tengri_events.52.b:0 "The Gods will bless our people."
 tengri_events.53.t:0 "Flower Wars"
 tengri_events.53.d:0 "Inspired by Nahuatl forerunners our warriors have begun to raid foreign lands already subjugated by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take prisoners to be offered at the Sacrificial Stone to the heavens. This is slightly problematic as these are people who have agreed to obey us in exchange for protection but the experience these warriors get in close combat could be useful to us."
 tengri_events.53.a:0 "Extradite the offending warriors."
 tengri_events.53.b:0 "The gods crave their blood!"
 tengri_events.54.t:0 "Sumptuary Restrictions?"
 tengri_events.54.d:0 "Taking offense to the luxurious clothes of a merchant in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a number of warriors have taken it upon themselves to storm his lavish home and rob him of his belongings. They claim such finery must be reserved for those that have distinguished themselves in battle and that they have rectified an offense to the gods. The merchant on the other hand is furious and demand retribution and for his property to be returned."
 tengri_events.54.a:0 "Side with the merchant."
 tengri_events.54.b:0 "Side with the warriors."
 tengri_events.55.t:0 "Confiscation of Idols"
 tengri_events.55.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been organizing their resistance against our rule through the local holy places and many of their leaders are to be found in the local clergy. Assimilation will surely quieten them in the long run but for now our Inti priests suggest that we confiscate their [Root.Religion.GetName] idols, by protecting them in our capital we can ensure that the people of [Root.GetName] remember where the real power lies."
 tengri_events.55.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 tengri_events.55.b:0 "Barbaric."
 tengri_events.56.t:0 "Ritual Ball Game"
 tengri_events.56.d:0 "Our Mayan priests are eager to promote the ritual ball games of their religion, a custom to which many of our warriors have been quite receptive. Many now flock to the courts to see their favorite teams compete though perhaps the associated betting is as much of an attraction as their religious conviction."
 tengri_events.56.a:0 "For the Gods!"
 tengri_events.56.b:0 "For the People!"
 tengri_events.57.t:1 "New Bible Translation"
 tengri_events.57.d:1 "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the Protestant priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 tengri_events.57.a:1 "Great!"
 tengri_events.58.t:1 "Predestination"
 tengri_events.58.d:1 "The idea that 'All events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God' is held dearly among the members of the Reformed church in our country. So much so that it has come to spread beyond to those that wouldn't be considered Christians by any definition. Whether it is due to this or not lately many of our subjects seem unusually eager to outdo themselves. Be it in areas of governance or economy."
 tengri_events.58.a:1 "Gold is a measure of quality."
 tengri_events.58.b:1 "Loyalty proves character."
 tengri_events.59.t:0 "Monastery Established"
 tengri_events.59.d:0 "Some way back a number of our most pious Orthodox monks left the areas under our control in order to create a fortified frontier monastery in the wilder parts of the lands we border. The story of their success has attracted a number of believers to join them. Their settlement is now growing and will soon be noteworthy. Perhaps now would be a good time to claim the land for ourselves so that these settlers don't forget where they came from?"
 tengri_events.59.a:0 "It is time we claim those lands for ourselves."
 tengri_events.59.b:0 "They are on their own."
 tengri_events.60.t:0 "Arrival of a Rich Merchant"
 tengri_events.60.d:0 "Eager to make a good profit of the various goods available in our lands merchants from the wider Muslim world continue to seek out our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One such man is now claiming that we are not doing enough to capitalize on the resources under our control. For a modest fee he is offering to act as our agent in all contacts with foreign merchants in general and the influential finance groups such as the Karimis in particular."
 tengri_events.60.a:0 "Interesting."
 tengri_events.61.t:0 "Sickness of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.61.d:0 "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting Sunni physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."
 tengri_events.61.a:0 "Let the Physician try."
 tengri_events.61.b:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 tengri_events.62.t:0 "Protection of Pilgrims"
 tengri_events.62.d:0 "Our frequent wars have made the faithful Muslims of our state reluctant to undertake pilgrimages to the holy cities. While faith may frequently overcome fear it is true that pilgrims passing through our lands are often attacked and their journey is often a perilous ordeal."
 tengri_events.62.a:0 "We must ensure their safety."
 tengri_events.62.b:0 "Their faith will protect them."
 tengri_events.63.t:0 "Influence of the Khojas"
 tengri_events.63.d:0 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."

The Cossacks themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken.

There isn't a single institution in our country that isn't entirely under the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the power of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] depends on them now more than ever.\nIt is perhaps only natural that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ now also wishes to take a more active role in the practical ruling of our country.

Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems, however, that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."

Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Islamic customs and that we must ensure that the infidel are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new shrine in a province largely dominated by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the infidels in their place."

 dhimmi_estate_events.6.d:0 "Traditionally the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Muslim literati. As our government apparatus grows, however, it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."

 dhimmi_estate_events.7.t:0 "Infidel Brigands"
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.d:0 "The quickly deteriorating relations between the state and the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ have resulted in local relations breaking down entirely in some areas. Tax collectors tell tales of convoys vanishing on the route between areas dominated by the Dhimmi, together with what had been collected. In the cities the priests and leaders of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ agitate against us and it has become increasingly hard to keep track of our subjects even within the walls. Even those opposed to $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ influence now find that they question our ability to rule."

 dhimmi_estate_events.8.t:0 "Riches of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.d:0 "Throughout the Islamic world the term $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ has come to be applied to a wide and disparate variety of people. The traditional and more restrictive definition of only Christians and Jews has quickly been abandoned by Muslim states where the majority populations are Hindus or Buddhists. Regardless of who are included the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ receive protection in exchange for being exempt from many of the laws of the realm.\nWhile this may seem unfortunate for them it is quite fortunate for us right now, while the general economy is currently still recovering from recent wars many families of the Dhimmi still hold quite large cash reserves and they have no laws or rules forbidding them from investing or lending it to others."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.a:0 "Convince the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ to invest in economic recovery."
