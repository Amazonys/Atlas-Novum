There was a proposal to modify the Articles of Confederation, but it was decided it would be better to create a new government than fix the existing one.

Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists opposed the growing government and rode the wave of popular fears of insidious royalism. Adams supporters retaliated by condemning the French Revolution as Monocracy, the former cherished by the Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists on the other hand still viewed England as the principal enemy and said that Adams was going to pay lip service to Her Majesty's Government. Washington's support and the New Englanders' effort to stop Alexander Hamilton from sabotaging Adams campaign gave Adams a marginal electoral victory, 71-68.

But it also created a great debate of the limits of power of government that never ended, but continues up to this day and beyond. However, depending on the political position of the President and the representatives in Congress a different legislation package could have been approved. How will you choose, Mr. President?"

Initially the Federalists monopolized the media thanks to the Sedition Act that outlawed most opposition as treason. Though this Act was also the rallying point of the Anti-Federalists, or the Republicans, as they were now called as James Madison had written the controversial Virginia and Kentucky Resolution in 1798-1799 which declared the Sedition Act unconstitutional. At a late stage the majority in New York changed and the new electoral votes changed the balance into the favor of Jefferson. However, as the nominally vice presidential candidate Aaron Burr got the same number of electoral votes as the Jefferson, Burr later forced the issue to a vote in the House which was eventually won by Jefferson. The Electoral Votes: Jefferson 73, Burr 73, Adams 65. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?"

The Party had been severely damaged by a radical group within called the Essex Junta, which had tried in vain to enlist some eastern seaboard states to secede from the union forming a New England Confederacy free of Jeffersonian Democracy. Among the elites of the country many still supported the Federalists and Pinckney, but the masses were discouraged by the behavior of the Junta. The Biggest Issue was the Louisiana Purchase as Federalists feared that more immigrants (Jefferson-supporters that is) would break the balance of power at the expense of the Federalists. Thus, Jefferson made significant inroads in once solidly Federalist New England and victory was his. Electoral Votes: Jefferson 162, Pinckney 14. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?"

As Secretary of State he had been handled the Embargo which was both retaliation against French and British disrespect and a policy of Protectionism. The Embargo was very unpopular in both camps, thus the Federalists once again revitalized under Charles Pinckney and Free-Trade Republicans threatened to support the republican vice presidential candidate George Clinton. The Free-Trade threat never materialized and although Pinckney did well he could not compete with the popularity of former President Jefferson. Jefferson was instrumental in urging fellows and foes alike to stand behind Madison and thus securing his victory. Electoral Vote: Madison 122, Pinckney 47, Clinton 6.

Great Britain disrespected US neutral rights at sea and impressed American seamen and confiscated the goods of her ships at sea. She also encouraged and supported Indian Unrest in the West. This together with the fact that some American gentlemen like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun lobbied aggressively for war in an effort to exploit the opportunity to seize Canada made it hard for the President in International affairs. The Nation was though badly divided and when the President asked the Congress for a declaration of war (June1) the South and the West voted for and New England against. The war was not a great success for the United States military and the White House was bombarded by the Royal Navy. Only the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 was considered a victory. The war ended in a status quo peace, but it could very well have ended differently. Who will you choose Mr. President?"

Madison's campaigners defended the war as necessary to establish American neutral rights. Madison was not that popular, but two things turned against Clinton.

James Monroe was supported by two popular former presidents, Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe was a skilled tactician doing very little campaigning. The election was a sure thing all from the beginning as there were in fact only one efficient party, the Republicans. The Federalists existed, but was trashed from opposing the War of 1812 and had its voters in the New England area. Its organization and form was old and obsolete, and it did not even officially nominate a candidate. It though supported Rufus King who put up only token opposition against the republican juggernaut. The Republicans was on the other hand an all-American movement with strong bases in New York, Virginia and in the South from which it campaigned with skill and effect. Four republican presidential terms in a row had strengthened the party proportionally to the decline of the Federalists. James Monroe won a walk-over even if it was not as superior as his victory in 1820 where he grabbed all electors but one. Electoral Votes: Monroe 183, King 34.
