#The Duchy underwent various future territorial changes, becoming increasingly small until the mid-15th century,
#when it would start to expand again, resulting in the recreation of the Duchy of OPLle and Racibórz under Duke Jan II the Good in 1521. Jan however died without issue in 1532 and the OPLle line of the Piasts became extinct,
#whereafter OPLle and Racibórz as feudal fiefdoms reverted to the sovereignty of the Bohemian Crown. It would then fall to Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach from the House of Hohenzollern, 
#who had signed his inheritance treaty with Duke Jan in 1522 with the consent of the Bohemian king Ferdinand I of Habsburg. Between 1645 - 1666 OPLle was held in feu by the Polish House of Vasa, reverting to the Habsburg Kings of Bohemia. In 1742 it was annexed and incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia.
