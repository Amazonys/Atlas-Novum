#and from the Canadian elite, who feared American conquest would destroy the old order by introducing Protestantism, Anglicization, republican democracy, and commercial capitalism; and weakening the Catholic Church. 
#The Canadian inhabitants feared the loss of a shrinking area of good lands to potential American immigrants.
