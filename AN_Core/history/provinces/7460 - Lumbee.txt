#Wawee / Bladen County
#This area generally considered to be uninhabited in historic times. State-recognized Lumbee tribe of very very dubious origin here currently
#
#I picked Wawee as a name to fill the map, basically. Wawee were mentioned in one carolinan account as Waccamaw & Peedee allies in their 17teens war with colonists; that may have been a version of Winyaw. Some have interpreted Wiapie on the Catawba deerskin map as Wawee, others as Weyapee. I have no good options
