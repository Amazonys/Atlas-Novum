# Ochese-Ocmulgee/Macon
#Ocute is de Soto era name. He found a paramount chiefdom comprising Ocute, Ichise, & Altamaha presumably on the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers
#nothing from 1540s to 1690. Apparently lower creek people including the Kawita and Kashita move to these rivers from the Chattahoochee to be closer to the carolina colonists for trade. They're also called "Ochese" because the river was after the hitchiti inhabitants
#Based on the names basically all the  Lower Yamasee towns in SC 1687-1717, these guys were probably ancestors of the Yamasee. Up for debate whether yamasee and hitchiti are significantly different
#For sure, kawita/kashita creeks moved to the Chattahoochee again after losing the Yamasee wars.
#big-time mounds near Macon, though the # of rivers de-Soto cross suggests the capital Ocute was on the Oconee
#Please ignore anything Richard Thornton ever says about "the Kingdom of Apalache" ever being up this far north
