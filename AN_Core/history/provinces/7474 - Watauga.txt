#Watauga 
#Were the Chisca Yuchi or the Muskegean name for the Yuchi? Or were they Algonquians that joined the Shawnee as the Chaskepe, their name becoming Kispoko? No clue
#Beck thinks SW Virginia, Hudson says maybe more spread out and that Pardo probably found them on the upper Holston.
#Later the first settlements of the overmountain men, the Watauga Association people claim flirted with independence, definitely having practical autonomy being on the frontier, before being a hotbed of State of Franklin separatism (from North Carolina, not from the US)
