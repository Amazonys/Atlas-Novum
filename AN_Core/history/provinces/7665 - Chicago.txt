#7665 - Chicago
#it's not super known where the Michigamea were pre-Beaver Wars. The name literally means Great Lake
#the French first found them in Arkansas in 1673, however, and they were very closely associated with the Chepoussa there. Could they have moved south?
#the only thing that possibly ties them to north Illinois is linquistic coincidences, but there are tribes who were known to have been pushed even further
#further than chicago to arkansas due to the beaver wars.
