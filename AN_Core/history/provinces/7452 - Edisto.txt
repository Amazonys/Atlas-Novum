#932 - Westoe/Edisto/Savanna - Orangeburgh
#Geographically, Stephen Creek at NW, Savannah R at SW, upper Edisto drainage basin at NE, down to the coastal plain at SE
#Edisto tribe was on the coast and the river was named after them. There are no good references to inhabitants of this area pre colonization except for one interpretation of de Soto's expedition putting Himahi (within Cofitachequi's demense) on the North Fork
#Westoe, assuming they are not Yuchi but Rickahocan refugees move in and are dominant for 20 years until crushed by everyone because of their belligerance
#Yuchi and Savanna Shawnee bands both after Westoe. Chickasaw under the Squirrel King for a short time
#Later part of Orangeburgh County. Drawn on the map to be slightly north of Edisto North Fork so as to include Orangeburg town
