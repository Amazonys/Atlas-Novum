#937 Tuscarora/Torpao. Edgecomb Co.
#Torpao was said to be the "indian" name for the Tar river. Presumably Iroquoian, but who knows. By my (Arg) naming system, can't call the area Tuscarora if they are given multiple provinces.
#border between this and Catechna drawn at ridgeline between Pamlico/Tar and Neuse river basins. SW third of Bertie County & the Roanoke river bank to have room for later town of Resootska. Cutting off N at Halifax Co.
#Edgecomb came after Bertie, but Bertie (and Pitt) are not fully shown in this province
#upper (lower Roanoke, Resootskeh & Ooneroy towns) & middle ( middle tar-pamlico river, Ucohnerunt & Nonawharitsa towns)) tuscarora towns
