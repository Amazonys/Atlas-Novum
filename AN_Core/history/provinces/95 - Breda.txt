#https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baronie_van_Breda
#Met 'terugwerkende' kracht zou men ook de hoge edelman Jan IV van Nassau, zoon en opvolger van het echtpaar Engelbert I van Nassau en Johanna van Polanen, nog wel een baron van Breda (1442-1475) kunnen noemen, maar hij was al een graaf van Nassau. Via de eveneens Bredase Nassau René van Chalon kwam de heerlijkheid in 1538 als erfelijk bezit aan de erfopvolger uit het huis Nassau-Dillenburg, die sindsdien een prinsentitel prins van Oranje voerde.[2]

#Draiocht note - Base files say 'Flanders incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire' in 1548. I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'. While it is true that this act centralised the Low Countries and organised them within a HRE structure, it also appears to have explicitly outlined the Low Countries as 'not part of the HRE'.
