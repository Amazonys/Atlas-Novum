#https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baronie_van_Breda
#Met 'terugwerkende' kracht zou men ook de hoge edelman Jan IV van Nassau, zoon en opvolger van het echtpaar Engelbert I van Nassau en Johanna van Polanen, nog wel een baron van Breda (1442-1475) kunnen noemen, maar hij was al een graaf van Nassau. Via de eveneens Bredase Nassau Ren√© van Chalon kwam de heerlijkheid in 1538 als erfelijk bezit aan de erfopvolger uit het huis Nassau-Dillenburg, die sindsdien een prinsentitel prins van Oranje voerde.[2]

I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'.
