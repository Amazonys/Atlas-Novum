#De Beeldenstorm, voorbode van de Tachtigjarige Oorlog, bereikte Leeuwarden op 6 september 1566. Desondanks bleef de stad koningsgezind tijdens Oranjes tweede invasie, terwijl bijvoorbeeld Franeker en Stavoren enkele maanden calvinistisch bestuur kenden tot Spaanse soldaten het koninklijk gezag herstelden. In februari 1579 maakten opstandelingen zich meester van de blokhuizen van Leeuwarden, Harlingen en Stavoren, waardoor Friesland aan de zijde van de Opstand komt; in maart sluiten de Friese steden zich aan bij de Unie van Utrecht. Cuneris Petri, de enige bisschop van het Bisdom Leeuwarden, die aangesteld was in 1569, belandde bij de calvinistische machtsovername korte tijd in het gevang en vertrok daarna voorgoed uit Friesland. De Sint-Vituskerk werd in de jaren 1595 en 1596 wegens verregaande bouwvalligheid afgebroken.
