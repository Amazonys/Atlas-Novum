#Sconondihago were a poorly attested to group (one time a Susquehannock chief signed a treaty, and the English scribe put him down as "Waddon hago of Sconondihago nation". Steckley thinks it may be a different version of the Onontioronon group who showed up in a French/Huron map one time, sc- being sometimes added and -haga and -hronon both being Iroquoian suffixes for people groups.) I cannot find anything on Iroquoian names for the Conemaugh river, but it's apparently Kwënamuxkw Sipu to the Lenape
