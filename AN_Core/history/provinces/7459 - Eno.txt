#Eno / Orange County
#Eno Tribe and the Shakori were here when Lawson was. They had consolidated by the time of Lawson
#Wiki says Wyanoke, Weanoke, etc are names the coastal algonquins gave to settlers for the Eno. They might have been talking about the Chowanoke. Haynoke with its connection to the Shakori might be more on the mark, though that was from a tuscaroran account
#Orange predates Durham, but Durham is more iconic
