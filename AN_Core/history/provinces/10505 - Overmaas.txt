#Wiki quote follows
#Though it shared the fate of Brabant, Limburg remained a separate Imperial State, which in 1404 passed from Joanna of Brabant to Anthony of Valois, 
#son of the Burgundian duke Philip the Bold. With the Burgundian heritage of Mary the Rich, it was bequested to her husband Maximilian I from the 
#Austrian House of Habsburg in 1482. Combined with the Landen van Overmaas (the lands beyond the Meuse: Dalhem, Herzogenrath and Valkenburg)
#and Maastricht, the duchy became one of the Seventeen Provinces held by the Habsburgs within the Burgundian Circle established in 1512. Significant 
#towns in Limburg proper were Herve, Montzen, Lontzen, Eupen, Baelen and Esneux.
#Draiocht conclusion, we probably need a new tag here, but doing without for now. Eventually, it sounds like a lesser in PU under Burgundy, or perhaps a vassal like Cambrai, might be ideal

I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'.
