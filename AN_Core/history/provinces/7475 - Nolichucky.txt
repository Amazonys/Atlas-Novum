#Going with theory that these were muskogean, represented as koasati here (Chiaha/Olameco & Tasqui), constituents of the Coosa paramount chieftancy in the mid 16th century as observed by De Soto and Pardo
#Nolichucky river valley. either De Soto or Pardo found Guasili and Canasaga here too; both are interpreted as Cherokee by Hudson, and Canasaga is very clearly Iroquoian. Not sure about Guasili, but Canasaga would be Gansagi or something in Cherokee
