# Kanuwara - Wheeling  Ohio COunty
#Honniasont is a little known tribe in the area, probably iroquoian, or an iroqoian word for someone else
#Wheeling Creek's name, probably seneca & 18th century, is francicized as variously Ranonoura as Kanououara. Probably some transcription errors involved, possibly Mohawk word for skull Kanuwara (the archaeological society around there thinks so)
