# Ocute-Oconee/Millegedville
#Ocute is de Soto era name. He found a paramount chiefdom comprising Ocute, Ichise, & Altamaha presumably on the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers
#nothing from 1540s to 1690. 
#the remnants of the ocute & ichese chiefdom became the Yamasee, based on the names of their towns in SC in the early 1700s
#Apparently lower creek "Ochese" people including the Kawita and Kashita move to these rivers from the Chattahoochee to be closer to the carolina colonists for trade
#Separately the Ochese creeks moved to the Chattahoochee again after the Yamasee wars.

#Please ignore anything Richard Thornton ever says about Hitchiti or "the Kingdom of Apalache" ever being up this far north
