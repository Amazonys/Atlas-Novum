#Altamaha/Utinahica
#Utinahica is described as being a native village, obviously Timucuan unless misnamed up past "the forks" that the spanish attended to
#But this is also where la tama or altamaha is supposed to be, and no archaeological evidence of san isabel de utinahica hs been found thus far
#The Westo or other hostiles with guns pushed the creeks that the Spanish referred to as the Yamasee to their missions mid 17th century
