##Vasileia Armenian names for AN - 2022 - Work in Progress.

# Some key information:
# There are two major Armenian dialects/pronunciations. Eastern and Western respectively. This changes some things in regards to localization too.
# I will use Western and Eastern in their respective historical regions.
# For example: The 2nd letter in the alphabet, ben/pen (B in Latin) is pronounced like a "b" in Eastern and an aspirated "p" sound in Western.
# Meanwhile, for pe/be (P in Latin), it's basically the other way around. "p" in Eastern and "b" in Western
# Hence, the Greek "Polis" is pronounced as "Bolis" in Western Armenian. This is why Armenians of Constantinople are called "Bolsahayer" (Bolis Armenians)
