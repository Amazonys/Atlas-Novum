104 = "Mediolanon"   #Mediolanum was Mediolanon in Greek.
105 = "Chrysoupolis"   #Under the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna it was known as "Golden City", probably due to the presence of the imperial treasury. Alternatively just Parma/???µa. I'm kind of itching towards that because it doesn't seem like Chrysoupolis stuck with them.
106 = "Motine"   #Ancient Greek sources speak of ???t???/Moutine(Strabo), ??t???/Motine(Polybius), ???t??a?/Moutinan(Claudius Ptolemy). Going with whichever is closest to modern name.

112 = { "Venetia" "Venexia" }   #?e?et?a from modern Greek, but maybe Venetika might work better for this one, keeping Mestre's name, city name is the Venetian dialect Italian name

115 = "Pisai"   #Pisa works too but it's ??sa? to Strabo.

138 = { "Diokleia" "Diokleia" }
139 = "Mostare"   #Fictional Hellenization of Mostar. Bona (as stated in De Administrando Imperio) AKA Blagaj would very soon already be overtaken in its position by Mostar, I don't think the Byz would go back to that name, it's also Latin
140 = { "Vosona" "Vosona" }   #Bosna = ??s??a in Greek = Bosona (as transliterated by wiki) but im going with Vosona because of Betacism.

157 = { "Varadinon" "Varadeia" }   #Hellenization of the medieval Latin name Varadinum -> Varadinon. The capital is a shortened version of Varadinon and also the same as the Romanian names of the place which also comes from Varad(inum), Oradea and Varadia in this case.
158 = "Agropolis"   #Supposedly, Mures was known as Agropolis by Greek traders in the 14th Century.

197 = { "Rouskinon" "Perpinia" }   #Medieval Greek: ???s?????/Rouskinon
198 = "Rhodesson"   #Fictional Hellenization of Rodez & Rutenorum. Romans initially called it Segodunum, a Gaulic name. Later they named it Civitas Rutenorum, this is where Rodez gets name from. We of course live long after antiquity so it makes no sense to return to that.
199 = "Arvernia"   #From Latin Arvernia, aka Auvergne.

203 = "Lougdounon"   #I dont know... Lyonnais/Lyon would be Lugdunum/Lougdounon in ancient times but it seems a mouthful and unfitting for a Byz reconquest in the post-renaissance period...
204 = { "Gratianoupolis" "Grenovle" }   #Grenoble comes from mediaeval Graignovol which in turn comes from antique Gratianopolis/G?at?a??p????. Modern Grenoble in Greek would be Grenovle/Grenovli(G?e??ß??)

230 = { "Algarve" "Limani Magonis" }   #The region of Algarve was in ancient times known as Cyneticum, possibly Kynetikon in Greek?? Idk. Portimao comes from Portus Magonis or Portus Hannibalis. Portus Magonis would be Limani Magonis Hellenized
