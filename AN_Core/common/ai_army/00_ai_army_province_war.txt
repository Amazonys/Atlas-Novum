# Scripts in ai_army can be used to influence how the army AI behaves when certain conditions (Defined in the "active" trigger) are met.
# It is intended not to control daily decision making of armies but to define a general attitude that will influence (or overwrite) hard-coded AI behaviour.
# The value is (re)calculated on the first AI daily tick (or console command "ai_army_tick") after any of the following happens:
#  * The list of countries the AI is at war with changes
#  * The country gains or loses a province
#  * It's a new year
#  * A new game starts, or save game is loaded
#
# Remember: AI will choose the province with the *lowest* value. Use console command "mapmode armyeval" (and select an army) to debug it. 
#

# Dummy example (add 0 or 0*100)
# province = {
#    war = {
#        active = {
#            is_at_war = yes
#        }
#        eval_add = {
#            factor = 0
#            modifier = {
#                factor = 100
#                is_in_capital_area = yes
#            }
#        }
#    }
#}
