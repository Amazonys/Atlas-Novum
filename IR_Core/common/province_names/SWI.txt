#Removed by Draiocht because Brythonic orthography really doesn't work for any other European language (Confusion with Welsh's 29 letter alphabet that looks but doesn't act like other Latin script languages, plus non-standardised Cornish & Breton), better to use Germanic defaults.

#Removed by Draiocht because Gaelic orthography really doesn't work for any other European language (h and half the vowels are diacritical marks, essentially, and this does not translate well), better to use Germanic defaults.
