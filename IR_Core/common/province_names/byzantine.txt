#DISCLAIMER: I am not Greek myself, I do not speek Greek and all I know of Greek is by googling a bit on the internet and trying to figure out how to pronounce things. Do note that every B shall be pronounced as v.
#Also, if no Greek equivalent exists, the names are either transliterated to Greek from Roman counterparts, picked from more important cities in the vicinity or if none of these exist, translated from their etymology.
#Another thing: I know that the "Rh" does not exist in Greek and is merely a Roman transliteration thing. But I wanted it there because... it looks cooler, I suppose?

#East Thrace
151 = "Konstantinoupolis"
7138 = "Bizye" #Agathopolis was not quite the name of the province port - it is further north just inside Bulgaria, on the border to the province. Alternatively, another important town is Arcadiopolis - at one point the theme capital
3170 = "Arkadioupolis" #Mostly done due to Saranta Ekklisies looking really stupid on the map. Bergoule is an older name, but let's do this one for now as it was actually a theme capital at one point.
7137 = "Selymbria"
7136 = "Rhaidestos"

#West Thrace

#North Thrace

7139 = "Sozopolis"
7152 = "Ormenio"
7155 = "Diampolis" #Diospolis -> Diampolis -> Hiambouli -> Dinibouli -> Dbilin -> Diamboli -> Yambol.
7156 = "Tzoides" #Used to be Kabyle, ancient Thracian settlement, but foind a claim that Sliven was known as Tzoides in an academic fortification source.

#Lower Moesia
159 = "Dorostolon"
150 = "Trapezitza" #It's either this, Zikideba (Name of Tsarevets) or, more importantly, Nikopolis (Nigbolu, as localized in Turkish). Or you could take Sveta Gora, "Holy Mountain" and call it "Agio Orous". Feel free to choose. You could also call it Tarnobo, as that was apparently used in Byzantine times.
7157 = "Abritos"
7158 = "Markianopolis" #I have not been able to find the Greek name for this place, despite it having been a garrison town for the Byzantines. Surely it has a Greek name. An arab traveller suggests Shimenonis, but I'm not sure. Marcianopolis, though it is actually Devnya, will do for now.
7159 = "Pristis" #Similar to the above, Cherven fortress has existed and was an important fortress during the Byzantines, but it DOES NOT HAVE A GREEK NAME. Using Sexaginta Prista for now.

#Boulgaria
3166 = "Palatiolon" #Apparently Oescus (Modern Gigen) was also known as Palatiolon, i.e Palace. Oescus however was the name of the river. Pleven was known as Storgosia.

7711 = "Anausaros" #Found a claim to some "Anausaro" place in Vladicin Han. Using that for now.
7705 = "Remeseiana" #Using Bela Palanka's Remesiana. Technically Pirot had Turres, but it's too close to Sardinian Tourris when transliterated.

#East Macedonia
7127 = "Christoupolis" #Kavala is a rather modern rendition. During Roman times it was Neapolis and later on it was Christoupolis.
7128 = "Dyrama" #Drama was known as Dyrama or Hydrama previously. Draviscus is likely a different city, even though some scholars believe it's the same.
3167 = "Alexandroupolis" #Technically it's Nikopolis from Roman times, however apparently the Thracians called it Alexandropolis, so I take that as I have yet to use it.
7153 = "Despates" #Name etymology seems to be "Despot" and the river Dospat os known as Despates in Greek.

148 = "Thessalonike"
7120 = "Siderokausia"
7122 = "Berroia" #Two r's instead of 1!
7123 = "Bodena" #Contemporary Greek sources uses the name "τὰ Βοδηνά", i.e Vodena. Edessa was its ancient name, but we use this here, I'd say. Plus there's already an Edessa in the Levant.

#West Macedonia
1853 = "Kastoria"
3183 = "Boutelion" #You could actually call this Bitolia as well. Or even Monastir, which is literally just monastery. Up to you. 
7124 = "Serbia" #Alternatively, we could use "Kastropoliteia" (Castle-city)
7142 = "Episkope" #Or Korytsa. To be fair I'm not sure which one to use, because the town itself dates from post-Ottoman invasion. Before that it was merely a settlement.
7145 = "Achrida" #Lychnidos is the Ancient name and Byzantine writers called it Achrida, Ochrida or Achris.

#North Macedonia
3001 = "Skopia"
7146 = "Pelagonia" #This used to be the name for 3183, but it's basically what Prilep was close to. Though it was technically right next to Styberra, but who cares about that for now.
7148 = "Astibos" #This is the best I can get on it. Bargala was important and close by
7147 = "Tranupara" #Or Tranatura according to Wiki. Tranupara was given by Pleiades.

7141 = "Argyrokastron"

7140 = "Bouthroton"
7131 = "Arta" #Cannot find out anything in between Ambracia -> Ambraka -> Arta. Arta was likely the Greek name in the 12th century anyway.
7132 = "Parga" #This one's really stupid, because there's no name information whatsoever.

#Aetolia
3175 = "Angelokastron" #Vrachori was during the Ottoman empire. I desire no turk in my localization! However, the much more important Angelokastron was in this region, hence I use that instead of Agrinion.
7112 = "Naupaktos"
7115 = "Bonitsa" #Amphilochia? What's the point of this. Let's do Vonitsa instead.
7108 = "Neai Patrai"

7126 = "Zakynthos"

#Thessaly
147 = "Larisa"
3174 = "Trikala"
7117 = "Demetrias" #On 1410 map. Technically, it was already Volos at this point, from slavic Golos, but I'm not sure what to take here.
7118 = "Pharsalos" #Going for the older name here because I feel this city is rather famous.

#Hellas
3177 = "Thebai"
146 = "Athenai"

7114 = "Galaxidi" #Better than Salona as this posession was owned by the Byzatines up until 1447/1448 or so.
7111 = "Lebadeia" #Livadeia in modern name, but that's because of spelling.

#North Pelopponese

4176 = "Branitzoba" #Transliteration of Branicevo, close by and of importance
141 = "Idimon" #Using nearby Roman army camp Idimum on the river. There is no settlement in the region otherwise.
4239 = "Singidon" #This is supposedly what Justinian I renamed the city after its conquest. Was 141 pre-11.5
7716 = "Balioba" #Transliterated Valjevo to Greek similar to Branicevo -> Branitzoba. The other option is Gentzis, an unconfirmed name for a roman settlement in the area.
7718 = "Sirmion" #Sirmium
7724 = "Domabion" #Using Domavium. There is also an Argentaria close by.
3187 = "Zaslon" #Found a claim that Sabac used to have a Slavic settlement called Zaslon nearby. It sounds Greek enough.
7717 = "Malbesia" #Using Malvesia which layed on the river to the west.
7709 = "Pyrissaios" #Pljevlja was supposed known as "Municipum S(...)" during Roman times, so I just the name for the people group that inhabited the area at one time; the Pirustae
7710 = "Zaton" #Found a modern settlement of Zaton close by. Like Zaslon above, sounds sufficiently Greek.
7708 = "Antibarion"

7701 = "Episkion" #Found on wiki. Seems to have been an ancient Spiarantum in Roman times.

156 = "Tibiskon"

4532 = "Drobeta" #Was 3162 pre-1.27
160 = "Sukibida" #Due to its proximity to Constantine's Bridge between that and Oeskos on the other side of the Danube. Craiova is actually called Pelenbida.

2998 = "Mousalos" #The city is named after the river which is Mousalos in Greek
4128 = "Koumibida" #Close by. I use the same reasoning Sucidava was named Sukibida by Prokopios in the times of Justinian.
158 = "Agropolis" #Supposedly, Mures was known as Agropolis by Greek traders.
3154 = "Apulon"
4127 = "Arkobadara" #Place close by found on Pleiades
3152 = "Dakibida" #It corresponds better to the province city in-game. Besides, we're getting to the area where the Romans never settled
157 = "Oradeia" #No ancient name, hence literally transcribing Romanian. Alternatively you can go for greekification of medieval latin Varadinum (Baradinon)

4175 = "Lissos" #Fun fact: Kruje is right next to an "Albanopolis"
7143 = "Apollonia"
7144 = "Penestai" #This one is really annoying, because Peshkopi stems from Greek Episkope, which is what Korshe was known as before Ottoman resettlement.

7731 = "Elaphousa"
7735 = "Kyrikon" #Curicum in Latin. I also found a supposed reference of it being "Kyrista" in Greek, but then incorrectly translated to Curicta in Latin. Hence, I use the former.

#Bosona
1828 = "Kastadora" #Combination of old roman "Castra" & "Ad Ladios", hence "Ladies' castle" (Kastra Kyries), where I instead take the liberty and call it "Theodora's Castle", compressed similar to Kastra Komnenon -> Kastamon(e)
3194 = "Drinon" #Using roman Drinum nearby.
7726 = "Kanabeia" #Supposedly the area name in Latin, transliterated to Greek

3002 = "Katera" #Supposedly the area of Ilidza, which is nearby, is the site of Katera mentioned in De Adminstrando Imperio. Given that Ottoderp locates the city to Sarajevo which is even further away, I find this acceptable
7727 = "Leukon" #Made up from Levac/Lefce, because there's no name here. Niki suggested the name comes from "left"
7722 = "Chotza" #Found on Bosnian wiki, and this one looked sufficiently Greek.

3191 = "Tarsatike"
7082 = "Phlanona" #Using Plomin

#Azov
286 = "Tanais"

#Asia
2297 = "Sardeis" #Manisa is Magnesia, yes, but Sardeis was way more important.
318 = "Smyrna"
4309 = "Miletos" #I used to use Tralleis for this, but considering its utter destruction in the 13th century and then an attempted rebuild by Andronikos to rename it to Andronikopolis or Palaiologopolis, I'll replace this for the province port Miletos, that apparently had a Byzantine castle known as Palation. Sure, Ephesos was important in Byzantine history, but it declined horribly after Seljuq conquest in conjunction with sea levels lowering over time.
5134 = "Halikarnassos"
319 = "Mylasa" #Mylasa is technically further west. Physkos is the province port, however it together with Mogalla (Mughla) is painfully insignificant in Byzantine history.

#Lycaonia
323 = "Ikonion" #Wikipedia claims medieval Greek had turned city name into Kónio. The turkish name Konya makes a lot more sense then.
4314 = "Nyssa" #Discarding latin Cochisia. Technically Kochisar means (travelling) coach fortress, i.e fortress on the road basically, so I suppose I could transliterate that. Nyssa was decently important however. Pre 1.24 was 5153
