#Estate triggers
#The only reason why these are so complex is that the game for some reason does not count the provinces that the estate holds towards % of country owned by estate if the provinces aren't applicable.
#It used to be that the trigger only required that no province in the state/region was controlled by the estate.
#However, this failed because once the province was granted, it would then count as not being owned by the estate, as the trigger was no longer fulfilled.

#The triggers have been simplified greatly now.
