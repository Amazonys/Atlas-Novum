# Ocute-Oconee/Millegedville
#Ocute is de Soto era name. He found a paramount chiefdom comprising Ocute, Ichise, & Altamaha presumably on the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers
#nothing from 1540s to 1690. Apparently lower creek "Ochese" people including the Kawita and Kashita move to these rivers from the Chattahoochee to be closer to the carolina colonists for trade
#I'm just going to assume the remnants of the ocute & ichese chiefdom after plague, moved west, and moved back in 1690
#For sure, the Ochese creeks moved to the Chattahoochee again after losing the Yamasee wars.

#Please ignore anything Richard Thornton ever says about Hitchiti or "the Kingdom of Apalache" ever being up this far north
