#Wiki via Wyalusing town gov't site says the "Tehotachsee" tribe was in Wyalusing and their town was Gahontoto. Can't corroborate that. Also that Cayugas were the main attackers (likely)
#By some interpretations of old sketchy maps, the Scahentoahronons were here. Champlain also said the Carantowan (tribe or village or both) were here. I like the hypothesis that Carantowan is a bastardization of Scahentoahronon. Xwéwamunk if lenape, from which Wyoming is derived
