#Tuskaloosa was a chief de Soto encountered along the Alabama river. The Black Warrior river and the town named after him were later on.
#But towns along the Black Warrior (Hispanicized to Zabusta and Apafalaya) were under his sway too
#Mabilla was likely near the confluence of the Cahaba & Alabama rivers. Historians only suppose it's related to the Mobiles 150 years later via the name. 
#But (my opinion) that's a weak link given how often placenames are repeated when the meaning is simple (see Okatibbee and Oktibbeha rivers, same meaning in Choctaw but anglicized differently)
