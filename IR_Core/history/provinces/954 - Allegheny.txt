#A poorly attested to Erie group--possibly separate subtribe in confederation with the the Riquehronons or Arrigahaga or Erie proper on the lake--regarded as probably on the upper reaches of the Ohio, or the Allegheny tributary in my version of things. Oolikhane if Lenape. Saw one reference to village named Ganowoñ'go near modern Warren which is cognate to Caughnawaga/Kanawake (which are closer to Mohawk) meaning at the rapids.
