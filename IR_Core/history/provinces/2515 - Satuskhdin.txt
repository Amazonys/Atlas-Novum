#Cahinnio - Camden/Oachita County
#in Hudson's reconstruction of De Soto's expedition, his successor Mocoso went north and west of here but probably didn't cross the Ouachita this far down
#French found 
#Spanish colonial governor told a French guy to go found a trading post for them in 1782 at Ecore a Fabre or Fabre's Bluff
