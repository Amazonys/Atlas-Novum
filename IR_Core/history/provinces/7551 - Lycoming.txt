#Otstonwakin: an algonquian refugee town in the area in later (1700s) colonial times. Otzinachson is very very poorly attested to, possibly Iroquoian group or just geographic name. Elsewhere in the province away from the Lyncoming valley, the Bald Eagle's Nest creek & valley would be Òpalaneòhshixhane and the village there Òpalaneòhshixhay in Lenape.
