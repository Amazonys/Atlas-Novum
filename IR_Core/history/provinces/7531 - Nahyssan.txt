# Nahyssan - Lynchburg Bedford County
#Tutelo, an Iroquoian exonym, also called the Nahyssans, historians think. They called themselves the Yesan in the late 17th early 18th, and historians think that is related to Monahassanugh or Nahyssan. Tutelo or Tortero in some foreign dialects might be related to Shatteras in WV (I don't see it).
#Tutelo eventually became the name of the shared close language group spoken by the VA and northern NC Siouians, just because the last VA Siouan alive and interviewed was a Tutelo man living among the Iroquois
#Tutelo/Nahyssans later broke off from the Monacans and were found by Lederer and other explorers after 1670 at various points associating with the Saponi and Occaneechee in southern Virginia and northern NC, later agreeing to be absorbed by their Iroquois oppressors with the Saponi
