#Way out of Susquehannock area with this Kaiquariegahaga name, but we know next to nothing about the people here before the Iroquois kicked them out. Kaiquariegahaga was a possibly Susquehannock subgroup from the same source as Sconondihago. Punkwsutènay if Lenape. Eventually the Mingo (Seneca and Cayuga mixed with Algonquian refugees) were here, thus the Algonquian village name Punkwsutènay or Punxsutenay (where the modern famous groundhog is).
