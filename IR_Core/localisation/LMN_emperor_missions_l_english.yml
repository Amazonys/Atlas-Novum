 emp_bav_union_with_palatinate_desc:0 "The divisions of the House of Wittelsbach reach far beyond the borders of Bavaria. A branch of the Wittelsbach family has long been established in the Rhenish and Upper Palatinates, acquiring for itself the status of Elector, a position which the Bavarian Wittelsbachs are clearly more worthy of.

 emp_bav_italian_sun_title:0 "Expand into Italy"
 emp_bav_italian_sun_desc:0 "Over the generations, the people of Bavaria have been filled with a great yearning for the fresh sea breeze of the Adriatic coastline.

 emp_bav_illuminati_mission_desc:0 "Our glorious [Root.GovernmentName] has seen the rise of a secret organization that calls itself "the Enlightened". While some of their aims are worthy, others are potentially dangerous, relying on revolutionary ideas. We should take a firm stance on the matter and either adopt their program or stamp the organization out."

 emp_bav_tame_brandenburg_desc:0 "Brandenburg is another of the territories once held by the Wittelsbach family.

 emp_bav_netherlands_title:0 "Bavarian Netherlands"
 emp_bav_netherlands_desc:1 "Bavaria has an admittedly distant claim to various territories in the Netherlands. It seems only right, now that we have restored Bavarian power to much of our former glory, to revive these claims and reestablish our control over this prosperous region."

These documents are essential for both our own diplomatic efforts and for maintaining the competitive advantage of our merchants abroad, but it is an increasingly common practice for copies of relazioni to be published and made available to anybody willing to pay a high price for them.

 emp_ven_the_francocracy_desc:0 "Following the Fourth Crusade, we established several lordships in former Byzantine lands, and for a while helped maintain their presence in the region. The Greeks denigrated these realms as the 'Frankokratia', the rule of the 'Franks', but for us they were useful tools for extending our power. It was a grand time to be a Venetian. The time is ripe to re-establish our presence in Constantinople, the real center of power in the area, but this time we should play a more active role in the region's administration."

The Pope would not meddle in the affairs of our churchmen, and we would not meddle in the affairs of the Pope. These days, however, the Papacy has grown more assertive, even as our own power grows, and has begun involving itself in Church affairs across Europe.
