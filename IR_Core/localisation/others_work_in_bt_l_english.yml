The English Kings, distracted by their designs on France, have allowed their authority in Ireland to collapse to a small strip of coastline centred on Dublin, the Pale.

 irish_clann_legacy:0 "Clann"
 irish_clann_legacy_ruler:0 "Rí"
 irish_clann_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Banríon"
 irish_clann_legacy_desc:0 "Clanns were the primary political and social unit in Gaelic Ireland. The system was highly stable, but its power structures were exceptionally weak in 15th century Europe and its largely rural population unable to compete in a modernising Europe."
 provincial_kingdom_legacy:0 "Provincial Kingdom"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_ruler:0 "Rí Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Banríon Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_desc:0 "Ríthe Ruireach, or Overkings (also often call Ríthe Cúige, or Provincial Kings), were influential local kings, exercising their power over one of the ancient provinces of Ireland. Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralisation of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."
 high_kingship_legacy:0 "High Kingship"
 high_kingship_legacy_ruler:0 "Ard Rí"
 high_kingship_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Ard Banríon"
 high_kingship_legacy_desc:0 "The highest level of kingship in Gaelic Ireland. High Kings were crowned at the Aonach, an assembly of the leading men in Gaelic Irish society, at Teamhair na Rí. Though the exact reach and totality of the High King's authority varied over time, all other kings in Ireland were at the very least nominally subordinate, if not directly subservient, to the High King. The High Kingship also revives the traditional Tanistry system of succession, making it very difficult for a dynasty to lose power or be inherited by another kingdom."
 norman_lordship_legacy:0 "Norman Lordship"
 norman_lordship_legacy_ruler:0 "Earl"
 norman_lordship_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Lady"
 norman_lordship_legacy_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for miltary service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland. Nominally vassals of the English monarch, these lordships were de facto independent by the 15th century, and shared far more with their Gaelic neighbours than their distant English cousins."
 norman_duchy_legacy:0 "Hiberno-Norman Duchy"
 norman_duchy_legacy_ruler:0 "Duke"
 norman_duchy_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Duchess"
 norman_duchy_legacy_desc:0 "A title granted by the English monarchy empowering the holder to rule one of the ancient provinces of Ireland in their name. Historically a replacement for the native provincial kingdoms, this title came to represent pervasive and aggressive English influence in Ireland, but they were also highly effective at squeezing out every last ducat from their subjects."
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy:0 "Anglo-Irish Monarchy"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_ruler:0 "King"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Queen"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_desc:0 "A form of constitutional or representative monarchy based on the English parliamentary tradition of Westminster, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Magna Carta and adapted to the local economy."

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC9:0 "By the mid 15th century, Ulrich I Cirksena had united virtually all of the lordships of East Frisia, either directly or through marriages, but the count of Holland still claimed a part of his territory on the basis of an imperial grant in 1381. Lord Ulrich thus turned his attention to the Holy Roman Emperor in the hopes that Frederick III could confirm his position. In response, Frederick III raised Ulrich I to the status of imperial count in 1464, Granting the title of Imperial Count in Norden, Emden and Emisgonien in East Frisia, and bringing Count Ulrich I into the protection of the Holy Roman Empire."

 BT_PRUSSIAN_BLUE:0 "Spread of Prussian Blue"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME1:0 "The Reinheitsgebot"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC1:0 "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTOPTA1:0 "To better beer!"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME2:0 "Top or Bottom Brewing"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:0 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTOPTA2:0 "Set some aside for me!"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME3:0 "New World Distilleries"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC3:0 "As new world crops were discovered by the Europeans and importing alcohols from the Old World became increasingly unfeasible, the colonial inhabitants began exploring options for distilling the crops grown in the region. The first to do this were the Spanish Conquistadors who distilled the first tequila from the agave plant in 1666 when they ran out of brandy. Later on, the bourbon whiskey was distilled from American maize and while not unique to the New World, rum was distilled from sugar molasses in the Carribean and Brazil by plantation slaves."
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTOPTA3:0 "Cultural exchange at its most natural!"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME4:0 "Prussian Blue"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC4:0 "In year 1706, a Swiss painter known as Johann Jacob Diesbach settled in Berlin managed to synthesize a new blue dye. This blue dye was coined \"Prussian Blue\" by its first trader in 1709 and was promoted and sold throughout Europe already the year before. Its composition remained unknown until the 1750s when a French chemist managed to decompose the dye into an iron salt and a new acid, isolated and termed 30 years later by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele as \"Blue acid\". Prussian Blue became very important in Europe as it obsoleted the very expensive lapis lazuli previously used for blue coloring, as well as becoming the main color used in Prussian army uniforms and continued to be used for ceremonial purposes up into the 20th century."

 desc_bt_prussian_blue:0 "If there is anything Berlin was famous for during the 18th Century, it was the city from which Prussian Blue originated. Being produced and sold all of Europe all the way to Japan used by artists, the recipe was kept secret for a good 20 years until it was published in 1724, effectively creating a monopoly on the dye and thus, a great industry."

Issues came in the 16th Century however: The Golden inlet, on which it was situated, started silting, the Hansa declined and the city fell under Habsburg rule, resulting in a drastic decline. As the discovery of the New World has attracted many seafarers to seek their fortune overseas, it necessitates the return of Brugge as a great trade center and, as a major colonial port, in this glorious day and age."

We must seek strong supporters for our independence, lest we end up French, rather than Belgian."

 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.d:0 "Christopher of the Wittelsbachs rose to the throne of Denmark and the Kalmar Union as a result of the deposition of Eric of Pomerania. Christopher however was merely meant to be a puppet under the Danish nobles and, while he did succeed in maintaining some personal control, the nobility in all three kingdoms ended up acquiring several privileges and policy-making powers that the monarchs had gained from since the Viking ages. The Swedish nobility in particular did not like the king, as evidenced by them nicknaming him the \"Bark King\". \n\nIn 1448, Christopher suddenly died at the age of 32, leaving a power vaccuum that resulted in the Lord High Constable of Sweden, Riksmarsk Karl Knutsson Bonde, being elected king in Sweden, and Christian of Oldenburg being elected King in Denmark, thus sparking a power struggle in the Kalmar Union that would last until 1457, when Christian of Oldenburg would finally be elected the King of Sweden."

 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.2.d:0 "The Swedish nobility and the privy council upon electing Karl Knutsson Bonde as King of Sweden sought to unify the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king instead of the Danes. As Christopher yet had little support in Norway, attempts were made at convincing the Norwegian nobles, their Council of the realm, to elect Karl Knutsson of Sweden as their new ruler. Their attempts would succeed at this, eventually crowning Karl Knutsson in the Nidaros Cathedral as king of Norway in November 1449. However, the Swedish aristocracy, mainly the Swedish Church and the noble families of Oxenstierna and Vasa, were very reluctant in backing a Swedish war attempt against Denmark, and so, barely a year later, Karl Knutsson stepped down from the Norwegian throne in favour of Christian von Oldenburg. Later, the Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and the nobleman Erik Axelsson Tott rebelled againt Karl Knutsson, exiling him to Danzig and elected Christian as the King of Sweden."

The Norwegian Council of the realm, Riksrådet, has several candidates to choose from: Either we can remain under the Danes and elect the new Danish king Christian of Oldenburg, unite under the new Swedish king Karl Knutsson Bonde, or go our own way and elect the current guardian of the realm of Norway, Sigurd Jonsson, a direct descendant of Haakon V."

 dan_slesvig_holstein_inheritance_desc:0 "In 1439, Christopher von Wittelsbach managed to gain the loyalty of the Holsatian count Adolf VIII von Holstein-Randsburg by granting him the entire Duchy of Schleswig as a hereditary fief under the Danish crown, thus placing Holstein under Danish vassalage. Luckily, Adolf has yet to have children and thus a proper successor. Should he die, it runs the risk of separating the two duchies he currently controls, something which neither Slesviger nor Holsatian nobility believe to be beneficial. We must persuade the nobility of the two regions to elect us as the successor of the two duchies."

They entered the Rathaus, and as the local noblemen plead for mercy, few were spared. The city was thoroughly looted and the population was almost cut in half. With all the atrocities committed, there is no doubt that the city will take decades, perhaps even centuries, to recover. That is, if it ever will. One thing is for certain however: Once the other Hanseatic cities will hear of this onslaught, they'll harbor great hatred, but also fear, of us and our military."

It's desriptions differ, but all include horns, wings and an eye on the knee. While it was unfortunate that such a grotesque monstrosity was born to our city, it has sparked great debate over whether it is a punishment to the Catholics or the Protestants. Surely our theologians could twist the debate in our favour and cripple the heretic cause?"
 rav_venetian_ties:0 "Venetian Ties"
 rav_venetian_ties_desc:0 "Ravenna had always traded with it's northern neighbour and hegemon of the Adriatic, Venice. Before the rich deposits in Istria were aquired, Venice needed the salt that the lands surrounding Ravenna produced. Da Polenta themselves were often allies of Venice, and that led to their downfall - for the last lord Ostasio III had betrayed them and allied the Milanese instead. And even though he joined Venice again later, he was never forgiven, and the century and a half rule of the Polenta came to an end. Thus we must make use of the wealth of Venetian merchants, but not get drawn too close into their web..."

 rav_city_of_churches_desc:0 "Religion plays a great role in the history of Ravenna, and it is reflected in the large number of churches within its walls, even by the high standards of the peninsula. Eight churches date back to the cities glory days of being the capital of Western Christendom, and no less than ten further ones were built by the 19th century. The more churches, the more money for the city's priests who were thus always quite content, and the repairs of old and building of new churches ensures constant work for our skilled builders."

While the familes themselves were gone by the time the Pope reaquired it from the Venetians, the title and it's prestige remained. The legates themselves ruled quite ably, and Ravenna felt no decline from no longer being the capital of an independent state."

 rav_reclaim_lost_heritage_desc:0 "When Charlemagne conquered the Lombard state, he placed Ravenna under direct rule of the Pope of Rome, our greatest rival at the time! To add insult to injury, the treacherous Pope Adrian I had given the barbarian king free reign to take from the city as he pleases - countless Roman columns, mosaics and statues were taken north to enrich his capital of Aachen.

During the 13th century they had to contend with the podestas of other families, like Ansidei and Gambacari, but from 1312 they ruled as signori, the lords of the city. They survived Rimini's fall and continued on with many storied condottieri and priests until the end of the main line in 1757."
 mts_gambalunghiana_library:0 "The Gambalunghiana Library"
 mts_gambalunghiana_library_desc:0 "Founded in 1617 by the jurist Alessandro Gambalunga, the Gambalunghiana Library was the centre of city's cultural life, containing over 280 000 books, 60 000 of them ancient, the most notable ones being De Claris Mulieribus by Foresti, the original De Re Militari by Valturio, and the true treasure, De Civitate Dei by Saint Augustine himself."
 mts_all_ages_architecture:0 "All Ages Architecture"
 mts_all_ages_architecture_desc:0 "The long history of Rimini can be seen in its varied architecture. Roman architecture from Ariminum is particularily impressive - the Ampitheatre, the Domus del Chirugo, the still standing bridge of Tiberius, and the Arch of Augustus. Medieval times brought Pallazo dell'Arengo and Castel Sismondo, while the Tempio Malatistino is a masterpiece Leon Batista Alberti constructed for the Malatesta rulers during the Renaissance. The many buildings and styles will surely help our people with adopting new ideas."
 mts_roberto_valturio:0 "Roberto Valturio"
 mts_roberto_valturio_desc:0 "Roberto Valturio was an engineer and writer from Rimini, and author of the famous military treatise De Re Militari. Dedicated to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, it also categorises ancient works and offers an introduction to the history of warfare, and pays special attention to siege weapons and methods. It was very famous in its time, with Louis IX, Matthias Corvinus and Lorenzo de Medici all owning a copy. Such a military mind will surely help our troops, especially during sieges."
 mts_gate_to_orient:0 "Gate to the Orient"
 mts_gate_to_orient_desc:0 "Rimini is often called the Gate to the Orient, owning to its geographical position between the regions and cultures of North and South Italy, importance of its harbour, and it being the starting point of many crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. Our place at the crossroads will surely help our merchants competing in foreign markets."
 mts_renovation_of_rimini:0 "Renovation of Rimini"
 mts_renovation_of_rimini_desc:0 "The city's roman structure is visible to this day, but many renovations were needed during the centuries, due to war destruction and earthquakes, especially during the Malatesta rule. Making our own renovations will allow us to leave a trace on the the long history of Rimini, and return it to its rightful place in history that Ariminum once held while Ceasar spoke to his legions in it just after crossing Rubicon."

 pmo_strength_of_the_lizard_desc:0 "While the Coyote may be clever, we cannot always dely on cleverness to defend our home. We must look to Hatanutal, the Lizard, who wrestled the Coyote and won. Strength is key to defending our people, and we must be like the lizard to ensure we do it right."

 pmo_directional_spirits:0 "Our world is inhabited by great spirits that occupy each direction. Kuksu, Calnis, Suupadax, and Xa-matutsi. In times of war we must look to these to guide us to victory. After all, our enemy cannot win if he is outmaneuvered at every turn."

 mughal_government_turkish_g_assimilated_desc:0 "Super-sized bombards had been used through Western Europe since the 15th century but specifically the Great Turkish Bombard, cast in bronze in 1464 by Munir Ali, proved to be much more capable than any other, being able of firing stone balls up to 0.63 m diameter. Learning such designs and patterns will greatly improve our cannons."

 mughal_government_brythonic_assimilated_desc:0 "The Brythonic people represent the last remnants of an ancient culture that formerly covered an immense swath of land across Europe. While much of their richer lands have since been taken by Germanic tribes and Romans, the remaining Britons have been hammered into a resilient and strongly indepedent people prepared to face all comers and defend their last bastions. We can make use of this proud resolve."

 mughal_government_illyrian_assimilated_desc:0 "Despite their small numbers, the Albanian people have produced some of the most renowned commanders throughout history. Brilliant military minds such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt or Skanderbeg have achieved notorious feats many times in difficult situations. Having such people to lead our armies will grant us a tactical advantage over our adversaries even when losing footing. "

 mughal_government_aquitanian_assimilated_desc:0 "The Basque people have usually been the last of Iberia to be conquered, if conquered at all, by the many empires and kingdoms that have come to the peninsula. If we learn of such knowledge of irregular terrain and use of guerrilla tactics, we will make sure our enemies feel what we felt when conquering the Basque people."

Turkish messengers came [to Vlad] to pay respects, but refused to take off their turbans, according to their ancient custom, whereupon he strengthened their custom by nailing their turbans to their heads with three spikes, so that they could not take them off.\"\n— Antonio Bonfini.\n\nThis is just one of the examples of the well spread legacy of Vlad the Impaler. Let our enemies know that we shall not hesitate to apply the same fate to those who dare oppose our rule."
 mughal_government_egyptian_assimilated:0 "Ethnoreligious People"
 mughal_government_egyptian_assimilated_desc:0 "The Copts, Christian indigenous people to Northeast Africa, were once the majority group in Egypt. After the Arab conquest their fate changed quickly, but to their surprise under the Mamluk sultanate they found a more lenient attitude towards them. Copts then lived in relative peace and stability for some centuries. This situation improved more when Muhammad Ali came to rule Egypt. He repealed special taxes on copts, permitted their military service, and introduced many other integration policies."
 mughal_government_saharan_group_assimilated:0 "A Simple Life"
 mughal_government_saharan_group_assimilated_desc:0 "Fur people are a relatively small group consisting of mostly semi-nomadic cattle herd families and small agricultural towns.

 mughal_government_berber_group_assimilated_desc:0 "The Maghrebi cover the northern coast of Africa. They have a long experience of pirating the rich trade brought in by the Italian states. We should enlist them into our navy by making them Privateers."
