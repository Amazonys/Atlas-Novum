The 12th and 13th centuries, however, saw a gradual weakening of the Popes' secular control, and dozens of local rulers came to power through various means. While most of these lands are still nominally within the Papal dominion and acknowledge some degree of temporal authority of the Holy Father, they nonetheless act in all matters as practically independent nations. A concerted diplomatic effort on behalf of the Pope might be able to bring these states more firmly under Rome's heel, however."
