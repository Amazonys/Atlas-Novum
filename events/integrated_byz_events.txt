#DISCLAIMER: By integrating these events I have taken certain liberties regarding what events to keep and whether to modify them or not. In general, I like railroading without forcing an outcome.
#When Paradox creates events, the philosophy is adding historical flavour without actually directly forcing a particular outcome. As such, you will find some events being entirely removed,
#some being heavily altered and some may be exactly the way they used to be. There will be a comment next to every event regarding as to why changes have happened or why something has been removed.
