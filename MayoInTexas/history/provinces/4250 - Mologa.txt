#Draiocht note - As far as I can tell, it was incorporated into Moscovy by Ivan III, who was 1 year old in 1463. He ruled 1502 to 1505. Might have been (was probably) a de facto hegemony earlier, but going with full annexation in early 1500s.

I'm not actually 100 percent sure what Paradox is on about here, and feel like I must be missing something, but as I can't figure out what it is, I'm going with the 1547 date. There were terms like Gospodar or Hetman of all Rus', but 'Russia' itself came later.
