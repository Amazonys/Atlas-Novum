#NKA (Nakota) tag not used from Neprut's SE. Nakota are just Sioux who fled farther west than the others (into the mountains) in the 1700s when Sioux homeland was overrun by Europeans and Cree. Didn't really exist before this (well, more accurately, should be lumped in with Assiniboine before this)
#QQP (Siksikawa) tag not used from Neprut's SE. Vanilla already has BLA (Blackfoot) which is exactly the same thing. I assume BLA is used as a formable in SE for the Blackfoot confederacy, but I think I'm going to try to do events to encourage a federation to form instead. That, or just leave it at alliances, the member nations were rather autonomous
#QQO (Sarcee) tag not used from Neprut's SE. Sarcee were just Beaver people who fled south when the old Beaver homeland was overrun by European-backed Cree in the 1700s, instead of fleeing west like the surviving Beaver people. Didn't exist before this. Could do events at some point, though.

#Cree Note - While no/almost no native 'nation' in North America had a governmental structure anything like what was found in the Old World, the Cree especially were rural, nomadic, discontinuous, and autonomous. Despite their massive range, numbers, and huge impact on the history of North America, they never 
#really in the entire period had any sort of centralised government of a sort that merits an EU4 tag, even compared to contemporary native groups who were much smaller, weaker, and less 'civilised'. Despite this, they have a tag in vanilla, based on internal files I'm guessing once even two were planned. It is also 
#one of the dominant cultures of North America, so I'm ----in this one instance---- throwing history out the window and giving the Cree a few tags, at least 2 in core start, and up to 7 more in the native start. This will allow them to have the impact on both Europeans and other natives they historically did.
