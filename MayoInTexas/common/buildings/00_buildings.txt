# Building AI is now mainly hard-coded. The AI will estimate how much it gains yearly from each building,
# convert the value to ducats, and take the building with biggest yearly return as a percentage of the build cost.
# If lower than 1%, the AI will not consider the yearly return worth it.
# It will also require higher yearly return if the economy in not in prime shape.
# Forts' value also get converted to a yearly return based on terrain and strategic position, as well as available budget for fort maintenance.

# AI can still be modded though; it will multiply the yearly return with the value of ai_will_do.
# If you don't want the AI to build a building at all, make ai_will_do become 0.
# AI will consider each building to be worth 0.01 ducats per year as a base, so making ai_will_do above cost will have them build it at some point.
# It will still check whether it can afford a building before doing so though, but may save up to it.

#Draicht Notes on BTAddOn changes
#Generally adjusting buildings here to better fit the slightly different balance caused by BT's many new provinces. Due to the larger number of provinces (and thus more buildings possible) buildings are generally slightly weaker and slightly cheaper early on to prevent the few high dev provinces at start from dominating
#so much, as the majority of population was still rural at the start date. Then, at higher levels, buildings become slightly more expensive and more powerful to represent how in the later period urbanisation and centralisation made certain centres more powerful and important. 
#I adjusted quite a few AI factors and also made a few 'adjustments' like moving dev cost reduction to production buildings from universities and replacing it with institution spread and weakening forts somewhat. If you don't like it, too bad =p
#Also note that my changes to AI modifiers & factors may occasionally cause the AI to build lower tier buildings, unless the AI is programmed not to (I'm not sure if it is). Or even to build a lower tier buildings, then immediately/shortly begin construction of its higher tier upgrade. To me, this isn't really a bad thing,

#Another major change is I'm comprehensively making earlier buildings cheaper and weaker. Perhaps I just have a worse time than most with SoD, but building a cathedral shouldn't automatically double taxes, and building a 'counting house' shouldn't automatically double the goods production. This works very well in
#for BT balance, as well. With all the new provinces, there will be many more buildings, even more considering the terrain overhaul makes new slots easier to come by, so buildings should be considerably more common, cheaper, and weaker. Ideally, I'd like to see them as just one more checkmark in the building up
#process, giving a nice boost, but not something that can quintuple income. MP should still be king, with cash allowing you to perhaps double your income, or modestly increase force limits. Hopefully prevents the circle of buying your way to infinite ducats and winning by throwing mercenaries at problems.

#As of 1.24, the massive (and desperately needed) vanilla overhaul to building AI required me to move a lot of things around and I also took the opportunity to adjust a few more things. The only real notable change is European nations may, with the new AI, be a little overzealous and build some buildings when they 
#can't really afford them. While not really intended, it also has the side effect of strengthening Europe at the provincial level, if not at a national level, which, considering world history, suits this period decently as I see it. Please report any oddities you encounter or if my theory proves incorrect in actual gameplay.

# Manufactories
################################################
#BTAddOn Notes - While I appreciate the attempt to make these buildings more useful in high autonomy distant regions, I must say I can't quite agree that a flat boost to trade good size is ideal. Historically, manufacturing advancements occured in the heartland of nations, not in remote fringe outposts, and I can't
#quite agree that a trading company, or a wharf, or whathaveyou, would be increase production equally in some remote arctic or tropical outpost than in a rich, centralised core area. As a result, I'm switching the flat plus 1 to a plus 100 percent. This change will result in no change in provinces with roughly 5 prod,
#but will mean 1/1/1 provinces recieve roughly 80 percent less effect, and very rich provinces like Paris will see as much as a 200 or even 300 percent greater effect. This will see some massive increases in high dev provinces with valuable trade goods, and also dramatically reduce income from remote low dev colonies. 
#This is intentional.... especially with manufacturing buildings spreading the new institutions, we want these to be like other buildings... best in rich cored states, not something to spam in high autonomy 1/1/1 territories to get rich. Note that provincial bonuses become rather mammoth with this change (Sweden's 
#Great Copper Mountain could reach well in excess of 15-20 goods produced, to the tune of some 200-300 ducats yearly production income from the one province. As a result, I'll likely reduce the provincial bonuses slightly.) This may seem to complicate matters, but I think it solves more problems than it creates.
#Also introducing some building specific flavour bonuses and adjusting build times for balancing and enjoyability. AI factors also adjusted, mostly stealing from my university AI overhaul, in order to slow down (but not stop) non western techs, while accounting for extraordinary non western powers.
