I will be outlining how i will assign Government ranks to nations in Europe based on the now defined
1 Barony, 2 County, 3 Duchy, 4 Kingdom, 5 Empire

This might change over time based on new developments and new ideas.

Currently I'll be lining it out with this:

1 Barony, Abbeys and anything not prestigious enough to have gained the county title in history
limit diplomats to 1
diplomatic relations 1 or 2

2 County's, Imperial cities, Prince Bishops
limit diplomats to 1?
diplomatic relations 2 or 3

We need a general idea as to what is required to upgrade from a county. We can use vanillas Development system, but this may be bad.
Currently im thinking of a threshold between 50-100 dev..

3 Archbishops, Duchies, Margriavates and anything as powerful as a nearby duchy.
same as before

4 Just as before

5 Just as before

Specific Countries and reasoning:

Ill be mentioning nations here that are not represtend properly by a simple county, barony, or duchy system:

BRA-ndenburg - Elector-March so duchy rank
BV1 to 3 - Bavarian stuff - All were considered dukes by themselves
FRI - hard to say, gonna call county rank though
HOL - Technically a county, but in prestige just as powerful as duchies
FLA - same as HOL
LBG - Limburg was a duchy so keeping it like that
MUN - hard to say, technically a county tier but giving it Duchy as their strength justifies it
MVA - Moravia Magriavate turning it into a duchy
PRO - provence technically not a duchy but jsut as powerful

Luneburg and Brunswick - 

Magriavate of Baden = duchy rank

ANhalt - Principality, making it a county
