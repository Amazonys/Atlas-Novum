#I will be outlining how i will assign Government ranks to nations in Europe based on the now defined
#1 Barony, 2 County, 3 Duchy, 4 Kingdom, 5 Empire

#This might change over time based on new developments and new ideas.

#Currently I'll be lining it out with this:

#1 Barony, Abbeys and anything not prestigious enough to have gained the county title in history
#limit diplomats to 1
#diplomatic relations 1 or 2

#2 County's, Imperial cities, Prince Bishops
#limit diplomats to 1?
#diplomatic relations 2 or 3

#We need a general idea as to what is required to upgrade from a county. We can use vanillas Development system, but this may be bad.
#Currently im thinking of a threshold between 50-100 dev..

#3 Archbishops, Duchies, Margriavates and anything as powerful as a nearby duchy.
#same as before

#4 Just as before

#5 Just as before



#------

#pecific Countries and reasoning:

#Ill be mentioning nations here that are not represtend properly by a simple county, barony, or duchy system:

#BRA-ndenburg - Elector-March so duchy rank
#BV1 to 3 - Bavarian stuff - All were considered dukes by themselves
#FRI - hard to say, gonna call county rank though
#HOL - Technically a county, but in prestige just as powerful as duchies
#FLA - same as HOL
#LBG - Limburg was a duchy so keeping it like that
#MUN - hard to say, technically a county tier but giving it Duchy as their strength justifies it
#MVA - Moravia Magriavate turning it into a duchy
#PRO - provence technically not a duchy but jsut as powerful

#uneburg and Brunswick - 

#Magriavate of Baden = duchy rank

#ANhalt - Principality, making it a county
