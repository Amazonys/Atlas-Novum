#Adai - Vernon Parish
#Adai were an unaffiliated Caddoan group
#Alabamas, Coushattas/Koasatis/Quassartes, and Pakanas, all western Muskogean speakers who had close ties as lesser constituents of the Upper Creeks
#began trickling west in the decades following the British victory in the French&Indian War. They were everywhere in West Louisiana, but this area on the Sabine and upper Calcasieu Rivers had villages from each.
#They weren't exactly united, but giving them the tag nonetheless
#Wiki says Calcasieu river = Katkosh in Atakapan meaning "Crying Eagle". Sure.
#Calcasieu Parish predated Beauregard and Veron Parishes, but Modern Calcasieu is Lake Charles area or Atakapa in game
