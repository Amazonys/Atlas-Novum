#Draiocht note - Wow, Artois and Hainaut is much more detailed than the rest of the Low Countries... still, making it consistant by copying the others. The + and - unrest every 2 years also isn't strictly speaking that important. Might add a proper revolt for the Beeldenstorm later though, but based in Brugge, probably.
