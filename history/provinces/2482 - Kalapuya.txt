culture = plateau_penutian			#After almost a whole day of dedicated searching I could determine only that the Molala (various spellings) likely moved to this area from the SW Columbia Plateau in the 17th or 18th century, but absolutely nothing on who preceeded them. Smart money would be on another 
religion = totemism 			#Penutian group, probably Klamath-Modoc, Plateau Penutian group, or possibly Kalapuyan, but impossible to say. Similarities between Cayuse and Molalla could even be explained by the Molalla mixing with Proto-Cayuse relatives, who could have plausibly occupied a range 
capital = "Molala"			#including the Cacades as well as the Blue mountains... we know Numic peoples only settled this area semi-recently. All this is obviously rampant speculation. In the meantime, prentending the Molala moved here a couple centuries early.
