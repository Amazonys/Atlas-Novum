#De Lisle marked roughly this area on the "Cenis River" (Hasinai Caddo River, called Trinity at its lower reaches) as Kanohatino territory. Whoever they were. His intel was from a stolen Spanish map and the French La Salle expedition and would have been before the Wichita moved in, if they moved in around the turn of the 18th century as I am assuming, even though he compiled maps of the area in 1703 and 1718.
