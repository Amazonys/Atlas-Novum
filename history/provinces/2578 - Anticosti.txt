#Wiki Quote
#The island was annexed to Newfoundland until 1774 when it was returned to Lower Canada[4] and annexed again to Newfoundland from 1809 to 1825. It became a part of Quebec (as Lower Canada came to be called) at the Canadian Confederation in 1867. 
#During these years the island property changed hands several times, its owners generally using it for the harvesting of timber; otherwise no real development took place.
