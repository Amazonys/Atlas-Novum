#Swannanoa / Buncombe County
#Swannanoa because cherokee towns were on it and it was part of the more populated area in the province which itself represents the greater French Broad river basin within NC
#Suwa'li-nunna'hi. nunna'hi = trail, suwa'li was the cherokee name for the Cheraw or Saraw, since only the southern Cherokee dialect had r sounds. Literally means Cheraw Path. This wasn't a major population center by any means
