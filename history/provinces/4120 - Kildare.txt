# Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull in 1555, Ilius, per quem Reges regnant, recognising Philip and Mary as King and Queen of England and its dominions including Ireland.
# Over the course of the next two centuries, the Papacy and Europe's Catholic rulers continued to recognise Ireland as a Kingdom in its own right, whilst at the same time asserting its Protestant monarchy as illegitimate.
# Until 1801, Ireland continued to exist as a Kingdom in its own right, with its own Parliament; however, its government remained in English hands even after Grattan's constitution came into effect in the 1780s.
