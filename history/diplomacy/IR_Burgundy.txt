#IR Burgundy Diplomacy
#rewritten these all to be seperate from other lowcountries and habsburgs stuff

#design philosophy - everything that is not part of the main territory of a nation is split up in fiefs, vassals and unions
#everything burgundy used to own is turned into a fief for the exception of Luxemburg for now
#This might change later on, but since Luxemburg was a similar tiered title to burgundy I made it a union, same can be said for Brabant
#Holland and Flanders were different in this respect, I've used the union feature here, but more appropriate would be a Stadtholder-esque vassal

#Burgundy would throughout its ascendance start to control and gain a certain sphere of influence around it.
#This included many princebishops in the low countries like Cambray, Doornik, Liege and Utrecht.
