#### GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY

 This file is a collection of possible values and functions to be used in the creation of SMM options
 [All variable types, value calcs, conventional scopes and full color scales are available ingame as the 'advanced map mode' functionality]
 SMM types are variables and calculated variables that serve as value inputs to the mapmodes.
 SMM values are calculation options by which to assign type values to appropriate color scale values (0-32).
 SMM scopes are scopes from which to draw type values from and apply mapmodes to.
 SMM colors are groups of tradegoods whose letter codes can be used in smm applying effects.
 
 Things behind %%% are planned only
 Things behind *** are in the works and not functional yet

# SMM Colors:
 Full color scales (0-32):
0  ryg - Red-Yellow-Green color scale, 100% saturation
4  rygx - Red-Yellow-Green color scale with bias towards extremes
   %%%rygy - Red-Yellow-Green color scale with bias towards middle
   %%%dev - Red-Yellow-Green color scale, 60% saturation? (aim for vanilla dev map mode)
1  blw - Black-Blue-White color scale, 100% saturation
   rew - Black-Red-White color scale, 100% saturation
   grw - Black-Green-White color scale, 100% saturation
   blwx - Black-Blue-White color scale, more lightness
10 blp - Black-Blue-Purple color scale
11 blc - Black-Blue-Cyan color scale
12 rep - Black-Red-Purple color scale
13 rey - Black-Red-Yellow color scale
15 gry - Black-Green-Yellow color scale
14 grc - Black-Green-Cyan color scale
2  perc - Black-Red-Yellow-Green-Cyan-Blue-White color scale, 100% saturation
3  gr - Green-Red color scale with bias towards extremes, Red goes to 120%
 
 Partial color scales (need specific effects):
  road - 8-step Black-Blue-LBlue color scale
  ***fe - 2-step Red-Green-LBlue color scale, akin to Farming Efficiency province modifiers

Conversion to 3.0:

- Gold tradegood support

Conversion to IR/Nirn/Vanilla:

- monthly calculation event that reassigns production values for the different goods
- province modifiers showing icons of most prevalent good, localisation showing all goods
- show tradegoods on trade map decision?
- yearly price change event?

- rework/create/replace price change events
