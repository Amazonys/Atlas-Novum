#Tawishirowa - Marion County
#South of the upper White River. De Soto & Mocoso didn't go up this far. It was apparently unsettled in historic times, with the Osage claiming it as hunting ground after they moved west to Missouri
#Tawishirowa=White River in Tunican. I couldn't find a name for the area
#The Arkansas Cherokee aka the ones who started moving west decades before Removal settled in eastern Arkansas, then moved south of this area to the Arkansas River. Then they started settling on North Fork and inviting displaced Algonquian allies like the Lenape and Shawnee to other parts of this area
