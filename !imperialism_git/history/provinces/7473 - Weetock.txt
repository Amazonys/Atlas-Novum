# Weetock / Onslow

#Weetock is allegedly a native (algonquian?) name for the White Oak River. David La Vere in "the Tuscarora War" mentioned them alongside the Core and Neuse Indians like they were a separate group
#I can't find a Weetock tribe anywhere else, and La Vere also thinks the Neuse and Core indians were Tuscaroran (I haven't purchased his source to check, Smithsonian 1980s encyclopedia though). As far as I know, the Neuse and Core were just in the Tuscaroran council in Chief Hancock's town that killed Lawton.
#This is to fill the map. -ock is anglicized algonquian suffix for people groups.
