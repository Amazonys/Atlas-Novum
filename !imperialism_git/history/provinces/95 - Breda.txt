#New history Petrus

1477.1.5 = { owner = HAB controller = HAB add_core = HAB }	#from vanilla. Mary of Burgundy, an heiress, passes all Burgundian holdings in the Low Countries to the Habsburgs
#Charles V inherited the Seventeen provinces in 1506, would later go on to inherit Spain, then finally the HRE

#Draiocht note - Base files say 'Flanders incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire' in 1548. I can neither easily find info on this, nor disprove it, unless it is refering to the 'Pragmatic Sanction of 1549'. While it is true that this act centralised the Low Countries and organised them within a HRE structure, it also appears to have explicitly outlined the Low Countries as 'not part of the HRE'.
