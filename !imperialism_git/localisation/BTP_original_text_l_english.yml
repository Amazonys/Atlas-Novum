 irish_clann_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Banríon"
 irish_clann_legacy_desc:0 "Clanns were the primary political and social unit in Gaelic Ireland. The system was highly stable, but its power structures were exceptionally weak in 15th century Europe and its largely rural population unable to compete in a modernising Europe."
 provincial_kingdom_legacy:0 "Provincial Kingdom"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_ruler:0 "Rí Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Banríon Ruireach"
 provincial_kingdom_legacy_desc:0 "Ríthe Ruireach, or Overkings (also often call Ríthe Cúige, or Provincial Kings), were influential local kings, exercising their power over one of the ancient provinces of Ireland. Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralisation of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."

 high_kingship_legacy_ruler:0 "Ard Rí"
 high_kingship_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Ard Banríon"
 high_kingship_legacy_desc:0 "The highest level of kingship in Gaelic Ireland. High Kings were crowned at the Aonach, an assembly of the leading men in Gaelic Irish society, at Teamhair na Rí. Though the exact reach and totality of the High King's authority varied over time, all other kings in Ireland were at the very least nominally subordinate, if not directly subservient, to the High King. The High Kingship also revives the traditional Tanistry system of succession, making it very difficult for a dynasty to lose power or be inherited by another kingdom."

 norman_lordship_legacy_ruler:0 "Earl"
 norman_lordship_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Lady"
 norman_lordship_legacy_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for miltary service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland. Nominally vassals of the English monarch, these lordships were de facto independent by the 15th century, and shared far more with their Gaelic neighbours than their distant English cousins."
 norman_duchy_legacy:0 "Hiberno-Norman Duchy"
 norman_duchy_legacy_ruler:0 "Duke"
 norman_duchy_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Duchess"
 norman_duchy_legacy_desc:0 "A title granted by the English monarchy empowering the holder to rule one of the ancient provinces of Ireland in their name. Historically a replacement for the native provincial kingdoms, this title came to represent pervasive and aggressive English influence in Ireland, but they were also highly effective at squeezing out every last ducat from their subjects."
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy:0 "Anglo-Irish Monarchy"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_ruler:0 "King"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_ruler_female:0 "Queen"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_legacy_desc:0 "A form of constitutional or representative monarchy based on the English parliamentary tradition of Westminster, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Magna Carta and adapted to the local economy."

 koi_urban_culture_desc:0 "Our people have a strong urban tradition, being the majority inhabitants of Ireland's largest towns. In contrast, the Gaelic Irish are primarily a rural people, and so much of the country lies undeveloped. By building new towns throughout the Kingdom we can increase the prosperity of our nation."
 koi_bill_of_rights:0 "Irish Bill of Rights"
 koi_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "While we have much in common with the Gaelic Irish, there are also many points of departure between our peoples. To assure them that our differences are surmountable, and thus forestall any whispers of rebellion, we should take inspiration from our English cousins and proclaim our own Irish Bill of Rights."
 koi_anglo_rapprochement:0 "Anglo Rapprochement"
 koi_anglo_rapprochement_desc:0 "To better secure our borders from the depredations of England, we should resort to diplomacy. By attempting to build on the common ground of our shared heritage, it may be possible to make allies of our former enemies. This would secure our eastern flank and enable us to divert our attention towards more promising parts of the world."

 celts_monastic_schools_desc:0 "In the past, our monasteries served not only as centers of religion, but also as centers of scholarship. Unique in Christendom, our monasticism was permeable.
