 #Generic mission chains
 byz_the_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"
 byz_the_silk_road_desc:0 "Centuries have passed since Byzantium controlled the sea of Marmara and thus the Silk Road. While this was a long time ago, we believe that if we can undo the Turkish conquests that has dominated the past century, restore our rule to the lands and by extent control the trade around Constantinople, then maybe we can regain our position as the stopping point on the trade routes between Europe and Asia, even in an age where Europeans attempt to find new ways to India."
 byz_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 byz_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "Mare Nostrum, latin for \"our sea\", or Mare Internum, \"the inner sea\", was the name of the Mediterranean coined back when the Empire surrounded the sea. As we fulfil our Imperial ambitions in restoring the borders and reclaim our lands, we should also strive to make the sea ours once more by controlling the trade all over the Mediterranean."
 byz_gather_alliances_title:0 "Gather Alliances"
 byz_gather_alliances_desc:0 "Our situation is a perilous one indeed. With the Turk standing on our doorstep, many of our brethren do naught but pray for a miracle. In these times, we need to look outwards, for there is no way we can stand alone in these times: We need a light, a beacon, in these dark times, one that can help us survive the Turkish onslaught that is to come. Let us therefore send our diplomats far and gather allies. We will need them now that end is nigh."
 byz_northern_chersonese_title:0 "The Northern Chersonese"
 byz_northern_chersonese_desc:0 "With the help of our allies we have survived the Turkish onslaught and retaken the Imperial co-capital of Thessalonica. But there is no time to rest or feel safe, for enemies are lurking at our every flank. While we have gained momentary allies of different faiths, there is no doubt that we need to find a strong ally among our brethren. There just so happens that during the times of the Kievan Rus, our envoys christanized the Slavic savages, pulling them closer to us. It would prove that in our absence, these Slavic peoples have now pushed back the Turkic Tatars up north and are establishing a new Empire of the Rus. It would prove vital that we send our envoys to the North in an attempt to establish long-lasting ties, providing us with an ally that shares our struggles, and that in the end can stand with us as the last bastions of Orthodoxy in the world."
 byz_unite_orthodox_churches_title:0 "Unite Orthodoxy"
 byz_unite_orthodox_churches_desc:0 "Ever since our power has waned in our home region, our northern brethren have fallen out of our sphere of influence. The self-proclaimed Tsardom of Russia have declared themselves the new Rome, the Bastion of Orthodoxy. This cannot do. We need to show them that the Ecumenical Patriarch still resides in Constantinople and that here is where he stays!"
 byz_refill_imperial_treasury_title:0 "Refill Imperial Treasury"
 byz_refill_imperial_treasury_desc:0 "Our coffers have been empty for so long, our Empire even has had issues funding a proper army needed to guard our Empire's borders. Naturally, attempts at refilling our coffers need to commence, lest our Empire will fall into disarray and be eliminated."
 byz_restore_city_of_cities_title:0 "Restore the City of Cities"
 byz_restore_city_of_cities_desc:0 "The City of Constantine, the Queen of Cities, the Metropolis of the World, or just the City, is no longer the shining pearl that everyone looked up to. Alas, it has deteriorated to a state not at all acceptable - We need to direct great efforts towards restoring the city immediately!"
 byz_restore_imperial_co_capital_title:0 "The Imperial Co-Capital"
 byz_restore_imperial_co_capital_desc:0 "There is no doubt that while the City of Constantine is our capital and the definition of our Empire, the very important city of Thessalonica has suffered much during the Turkish onslaughts. It is no more than right that, in our attempts at restoring our glorious capital, we delegate some time towards improving the city that has long been considered the Co-Capital of the Empire."
 byz_restore_imperial_army_title:0 "The Imperial Army"
 byz_restore_imperial_army_desc:0 "The Empire has ever since its founding relied on a powerful army to protect its lands, subjugate neighbours and pacify revolts. As the Empire has dwindled over the centuries, so too has the army. We shall reverse this trend and build an army that will rival the Imperial Legions of old!"

 byz_deny_ottoman_access_claims: "Grants cores on the provinces required for the mission §YDeny Ottoman Access§!"
 byz_deny_ottoman_access_title:0 "Deny Ottoman Access"
 byz_deny_ottoman_access_desc:0 "In 1366 during the Savoyard Crusade, the Latins actually did something good - they took Gallipoli, meaning the Turks had no way of accessing their newly conquered Balkan holdings. Considering the Ottomans control some rather unruly lands in the Balkans at the moment, if we take Gallipoli, we can almost ensure that their Balkan populace will revolt."
 byz_reconquer_ottoman_greece_nationalism:0 "§YEvery province§! owned by §Y[TUR.GetName]§! in the §YBalkan Region§! gains §R20§! years of separatism"

 byz_reconquer_ottoman_greece_title:0 "Ottomans out of Greece"
 byz_reconquer_ottoman_greece_desc:0 "The heathen Turk pushed over the straits of Gallipoli in 1354, paving way for Ottoman advancements into the Balkans. Adrianople fell in 1359 and Thessalonica in 1387, although the latter was regained momentarily twice. Should we manage to beat back the Turk and recover from the brink of destruction, there is no doubt that the parts of Greece controlled by the Ottomans need to be retaken first!"
 byz_reconquer_west_anatolia_claims:0 "Grants permanent claims on the provinces required for the mission §YRecover West Anatolia§!"
 byz_reconquer_west_anatolia_title:0 "Recover West Anatolia"
 byz_reconquer_west_anatolia_desc:0 "As the Turk has now been pushed out of Greece, there is no denying that we need to focus on the other side of the Sea of Marmara: While we may control one side of the Bospor, regaining Scutarium & Nicomedia on the other side would allow Constantinople some breathing room, thus securing its prosperity. The strait of Gallipoli that once was wrestled from us after the dastardly earthquake needs to be retaken as well, to secure our newly regained holdings. Let us show the Turk that the Romans will not be subjugated!"
 byz_reclaim_anatolia_claims:0 "Grants permanent claims on the provinces required for the mission §YAnatolian Reclamation§!"
 byz_reclaim_anatolia_title:0 "Anatolian Reclamation"

 byz_no_turkish_country:0 "No country with §YTurkish§! as primary culture exists"
 byz_turkic_question_title:0 "The Turkic Question"
 byz_turkic_question_desc:0 "Now that we have restored [Root.GetAdjective] rule to Anatolia, the question now lies on what we do with the populace. Centuries of rule by Turks have lead to the region becoming desolate and what people still remain have either immigrated from the Eastern Steppes or have embraced the language and culture of their conquerors. The lands of Anatolia have seen much and it'll take a lot of work to get them back to where they were in the glory times, but in order to even begin our restoration, we need to decide what to do with the turkic part of our populace - do we accept it and allow them to serve in our armies as true Romans like we did with the Armenians, or do we demand that they embrace Greek or be persecuted?"
 turkic_question_tooltip_1:0 "If §Y[Root.GetName]§! integrates §YTurkish§! culture:"

 #Byz Religious Tree chain
 byz_question_of_schismatics_title:0 "A Question of Schismatics"
 byz_question_of_schismatics_desc:0 "With the Council of Florence culminating in the conversion of John VIII and the rest of the Palaiologos except Demetrios, the religious question of the Empire is a difficult one - what John VIII and the now dead Patriarch Joseph II did was not something that the [Root.GetAdjective] monks would abide to, not only due to the separation of power in the Orthodox Church, but also due to principles. This created a divide of unionists and anti-unionists which up until this point has not been solved and causes great turmoil among our populace. We need to pick a side and then \"convince\" the other that our faith is the future of [Root.GetName]!"
 EST_REMAINED_ORTHODOX:0 "Remained loyal to Orthodoxy: $VAL$"
 convert_anatolia_title:0 "Convert Anatolia"

 byz_no_latins_in_greece_title:0 "No Latins in Greece!"
 byz_no_latins_in_greece_desc:0 "The current state of Greece is disastrous - While we hold the despotate of Morea, every other part of Greece is currently held by either the heathen Turk, or despicable Latins. Not even the Despotate of Epirus can claim any of its heritage, now being ruled by the Latin Tocco. While we have managed to exact tribute over the lord of Athens and secured the loyalty of the Gattilusi in Lesbos through intermarriage, they are very autonomous. While beating back the Turk from Greece is a very difficult task we believe it just as necessary to rid these lands from current Latin influence, lest we risk the loss of Constantinople; not to the Turks, but to them."
 byz_expand_naval_dominance_title:0 "Naval Dominance"
 byz_expand_naval_dominance_desc:0 "Our shipbuilders have deserted us and defected to the Ottomans. Once upon a time, [Root.GetName] had a grand navy. We shall strive to establish a naval force that can mirror the glories of the past. Only then can we hope to compete with our rivals."
